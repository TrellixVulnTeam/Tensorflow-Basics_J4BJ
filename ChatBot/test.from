do they have an ocean? i've heard about the ocean

what's that like?
well it's big and it's blue    it's really really blue
you want some berries?

 her father

and almost got hanged in peacetime
 like prince charming
yeah 
what department store did they go to?
mcintire's
mcginty's
no mcintire's remember:  "for the very best in men's attire head right down to mcintire's"
saywhy don't you take this remote instead it's got a little more "ooomph" in it
ooomph?
how much does it cost?
 see every time i thought i'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me they'd know the early episodes but they wouldn't know the later ones  they'd know all about muffin but they wouldn't know about bud 
i'm the better soldier jesse
what the hell's going on
why would i do that?
because we don't belong
oh sure you do  "mcintire's department store"  "their father dressed as prince charming" that was gorgeous bud
lookwe appreciate it we really do we justwe want to go home now
don't get upset
weil wouldn't you you look for someone for years  you pour your heart into it  this is a privilege you know  i don't think i better talk about this right now
where are you going 
i don't think we should discuss this until i'm a little bit more composed
wait a minute
still smells fishy
maybe in a day or so when i'm not so emotional 
hello there
 hi
so even though i can't make any promises welli figured if you asked me real nicei might just be willing to talk about it again
i can't
what?
budi thought you wanted to come home
oh  i do yeah it's just that i told my "dad" i'd clean out the rain gutters and mr johnson wanted me to  to change the tape in the register 
i'll be honest with you bud i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these reruns 
reruns?
fine we hit this bank
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey   those aren't your cookies bud
oh i know they're not but i mean they're just "cookies" after all 
excuse me?
well they're not just cookies i mean they're great cookies  look i'd love to get into this whole thing but i'm really running late why don't we hook up tomorrow?
bud
i want a word with you 
ohwell 
what do you mean?
what do i mean  you think this is a toy? you think it's your own little goddamn coloring book 
lookit just sort of "happened" 
you want a war?  fine  we are a thousand  they outnumber us by ten who will you kill?  which tribe?
dammit
a deluge doesn't just "happen" bolts of lightning don't just "happen"   you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake 
i had nothing to do with that
oh i'm sorryrefresh my memory what episode does the orgy happen in again?
look 
it was a gift bud it was so special you liked these things as much as i did remember: warm smells in the family kitchen? a smile from a stranger? you know how rare that is?
okay now you're really starting to piss me off
i didn't do anything wrong
where's the remote control i gave you?
why?
because you're coming home i'm gonna put this place back the way it was
okay you're gonna rest here
no you're not
excuse me?
i'm sorry  i can't let you do that
ow
i'm going to leave now
hope you're proud of yourself
okay let's cut the shit and get right to it where's that remote control?
why?
because you're coming home
why don't you just take me back without it?
bob rip up some bandages
so  i guess as long as i'm here all sorts of things could happen to this place we could have pink lawns and blue trees 
just gimme the damn remote
i don't know what went wrong you answered every question you knew every detail the senior prom  mcintire's department store we had all the same warm memories: sock hops the church social 
how long do you think you've been here?
i don't know  three four weeks
now buddy you're going on trial tomorrow and if they find you guilty you're gonna be stuck here forever well not foreverlemme think   five year sentence  carry the three  that comes out to  sixteen and a half centuries and that's rounding down
i'm going on trial tomorrow?
there's worse places
bud?
sorry  i had to help my folks and then i couldn't find my hat 
we'll make them pay for this
what's wrong?
welli always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries 
yeah 
you know if this ever happens again you can make the fries even if i haven't put out the napkins yet
i'm so glad you're here
there aren't any cheeseburgers
what?
well usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce 
do you have the lettuce?
 yeah
i'm out
have you cooked the burgers?
yes
oh hi
hi there you took off so quick i wasn't sure if you were okay
bud 
yeah 
you know how when we close up i close the register then you lower the shades then i turn out the lights then we both lock the doors
yeah 
two cheeseburgers two cherry cokes
there aren't any cheeseburgers
what? we follow you for a year and now that our blood's been spilled you're gonna quit?
look i thought we talked about this i thought we said 
well  i'm not sure i see the point anymore
what are you talking about you make hamburgers that is the point
no i know  i know i do   but it's always the same you know? grill the bun flip the meat melt the cheese  it never changes it never gets any better or worse 
just listen to me 
 like the other night when i closed up by myself that was different 
forget about that
look you can't always like what you do sometimes you just do it because it's your job and even if you don't like it you just gotta do it anyway
why?
you know what i really like?
missed you cousin
 what's that?
wow  that's pretty good 
well don't you?
i think you should try not to think about this anymore
really?
yeah
oh hi
hi
aren't you a little early?
it's an art book
you know you gettin' caught right after leaving us some people thought 
oh my gosh bud 
what's wrong?
i'll never be able to do that
oh wellyou're just starting out i mean you can't do it 
it's okay we'll get you a new one
well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
it's beautiful
tv repair
tv repair?

that's not the reason i've got a date at six thirty
umhello? i've got like a social emergency here
free?
told you it was your lucky day bet you thought i was just a fan or something
what happened?
dream come true hunh?
this isn't funny i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes
some indian tracker you turned out to be tom
oh god 
hey
saw you at the mall yesterday
so you watching pearl jam on mtv tonight?
so uh  maybe we could uh 
cool
this is barry
hey it's me what are you doing?
hello karen i'm just working
yeah but what are you doing?
hi joey
we don't need to know
wait'll we get back to missouri start telling those gals about how little jesse james charged the whole union army by himself
i'm just workingi have some customers here
so you can't talk to me?
i have a few people here i can't really chat right now
"chat?" did you just say "chat?"
well i can't talk though 
you just fucking said "chat" that is so  what are you now? "chat" i'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight
yes i'll be there
fine you get back to chatting with your precious customers
did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
no no no
tom why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? figure we might have some work for you if you want
yes i'm still on hold
and what was this?
i'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
this is "fly with us?"
it's hard to understand because it says in addition to but i can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too
i think that's a typeo then that would be a mistake
so just to clarify i'm sorry: ten purchases of any of your healthy choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles 
that's it
do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
it's extension 215 if you want to try me back
hmm go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack or work for you
what city?
somewhere in utah
what's the listing?
hey how are you? barry i'm fine hi how are you?

i was yeah i was thinking about going there for business 
 well if you're gonna go 
 i'm probably not gonna go though
 oh that's too bad it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something 
you 'um big lawman?
it was great to meet you again to see you again thanks for helping me yesterday 
i'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
sure
do you want to pick me up?
sure
can i write down my address and phone number for you?
this is funny
yeah
i didn't ask anyone for a shrink that was someone else also: this pudding is not mine also: i'm wearing a suit because i had a very important business meeting this morning and i don't have a crying problem
ok
yeah injun what do you want?
alright?
hi
who is it?
really? that's niceare you lying?
that's very nice thank you thank you for saying that  you're friends with my sister?
yeah
how long have you known her?
about six months
you like her?
yeah yeah we get along well  you didn't get along with her very well?
great chief of st louis send me
did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
no no i did
that's nice it's nice  i've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways cross promotional work by some companies do you remember all that pudding?
yeah
so that pudding was bought i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines it's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products they make frozen meals deli meats pasta sauce breads soups and ice creams this sort of thing
yeah?
i'm sorryi lost my thoughts what i was saying
you were talking about the promotion 
 the promotion says: buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1000 for purchases made with a special coupon so in the supermarket you notice their products first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $179  that's a pretty good dealbut then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a canand you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label that's those little bar codes you know? the universal product codes?
yeah
of st louis?
that's what's used to redeem the mileage so in noticing the pudding each cup had an individual bar code  in other words: two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles add in the coupon: it's one thousand you see?
yeah
you see?
yeah no i see 
you see if you spent $3000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles
that's insane that is really really crazy that's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding
yeah
so that was your pudding?
no
i'm sorry i thought you said 
hoyah him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun above great river near eagle rock
no i didn't say that
i thought you said you bought all that pudding 
my friend carlos is doing it who works with me it's his it's his pudding he's doing it it's not mine he's crazy i told him not to do it he's the one who's insane he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though 
is everything ok?
yes
what happened?
nothing
what did he want?
i have a better idea of where we can go
there's a better place for us to eat
east? east above the river heading for the eagle pass?
did something happen; are you alright?
your portable reed organthe piano
well it's fine thank you
did you pick it up from the street?
what?
did you take it from the street in front of your work?
yes i did?
are you learning how to play it?
yes? i'm trying
oh that's great
in one act of brutality you have created chaos  tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us  all that because of your criminal savagery
go ahead to the saloon but don't get too drunk
so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
okwelli'm gonna go
yeah
it was nice to see you again to see your face again to go out with you 
i'll be around and back in town in a few days 
yeah
if you come to hawaii 
yeah i don't know we'll see about that
you don't think you'll go 
i don't know
i know it ain't no durned bank holiday
ok well call me when you get back i mean i'll call you when i get back i'll be back for three weeks and then i go away for a month after that so maybe in that time
this is barry
this is lena
hi
i just wanted you to know wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now i want you to know that i wanted to kiss you just then
really?
yeah
that was good
yeah
i'll see you later
you're right sir
ok
i don't freak out very often

wellhe's not that strange don't say that
i'm sorry you're right
i think he's weird but that's me
should i call you later?
i'll just see you when you get back here
welcome to charenton abbe du maupas
i'm pleased to have the new post sir
 and the listless ones do the binding
it's remarkable doctor the patients are so subdued; so docile
i figure
i don't believe it the marquis de sade? you're actually publishing his novels?
of course everything's not as harmonious as it seems i hope you've a strong constitution
my years tending the lepers at st emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings doctor
"and so the professor lifted colombe's skirt high above her waist 'let me be your tutor' said he 'in the ways of love' with that he slid her pantalettes down down down over her knees and there  nestled between her legs  as pink as a tulip as slick as an eel "
we oughtn't be reading his nasty stories 
you've been to his quarters haven't you?
once or twice
i hear he's got a whetstone and chisel and he uses them to sharpen his teeth
he's a writer not a madman
if you're going to slander him then you don't deserve to hear his stories 
see that's your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff i'm already finished doing it
marquis? is that you?
for fuck's sake who else would it be? the witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others yes?
yes well i awoke to discover i'd turned into a cat if you don't do as i say i'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks and suck the marrow straight out of your bones
at your service count
"one day fanchon's first client was a surgeon he ran his fingers across her naked skin pulling apart folds of flesh inspecting each and every follicle"
"with that fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue "
"to seal the wound he took a poker from the fire "
then how can we know who is truly good and who is evil?
madeleine 
yes abbe?
web's dead
has he hurt you?
i was wrong to free him but so are you  for taking all his treasures  his quills and his ink 
had i known your taste in novels i never would've taught you to read
don't say that; reading's my salvation
but why must you indulge in his pornography?
ow
but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
i put myself in his stories i play the parts each strumpet each murderess
why not act the role of heroines instead? queen esther from the bible or st joan?
in part yes
i reckoned
the doctor's a respected man a friend of the court 
i haven't been to see the marquis for ages and i won't  ever again  i swear it i won't speak to him i won't even utter his name 
charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here
don't turn us out abbe
it's a sin against god for me to refuse your kindness but my heart's held fast here
by whom? the marquis?
madeleine i there are certain things feelings we must not voice
why not?
go back to your room quickly
what? what've i done?
hell of a war
don't come back not tonight not again 
if you'd grant me a final favor i'd like the chance to explain myself 
they've got no right sending someone to sit on your shoulder i work for you; i won't take orders from a stranger
free his mouth
mustn't do that sir
i must grant him his last rites
i don't take my orders from you; not anymore
care for a splash of wine abbe?
it's not even noon 
i should've told you it was the blood of christ; you'd believe that wouldn't you?
well it's the men sir  they wonder how you know our position we've lost sight from land days ago
hello liberty missoura
we treat you well enough here don't we marquis? your very own featherbed in lieu of a straw mat your antique writing desk all the way from lacoste enough quills to feather an ostrich 
it's true dearheart you've spoiled me pink
in exchange we ask only that you follow the rules now you know as well as i do you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters
i'm entertaining you now aren't i?
i'm not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption
take your pen in hand marquis purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life
yes it is the paper's cheap the type's too small 
what did you do? bribe one of the guards?
but you implored me to write for curative purposes to stave off my madness 
but you've no right to publish behind my back without my sanction
looks like web mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got
have you truly read the book in question? or did you run  straightaway  to the dogeared pages?
enough to discern its tenor
and ?
it's not even a proper novel it's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions frankly it even fails as an exercise in craft the characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" 
there i was taxed; it's true
and such puny scope nothing but the very worst in man's nature
i write of the great eternal truths that bind together all mankind the whole world over we eat we shit we fuck we kill and we die
but we also fall in love; we build cities we compose symphonies and we endure why not put that in your books as well?
it's a fiction not a moral treatise
but isn't that the duty of art? to elevate us above the beast?
frank don't you have something to say?
i thought that was your duty abbe not mine
one more trick like this and i'll be forced to revoke all your liberties
it's that doctor fellow isn't it? he's come to usurp your place here hasn't he?
more than your writing's at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure
they can't be serious
our future lies in the stroke of your pen
mightier than the sword indeed
put yourself in my place i've your fellow patients to consider if charenton falls they've no place to go no manner in which to clothe or feed themselves 
fuck 'em they're halfwits and pinheads let 'em die on the streets as nature intended
you've a touch of the poet too; perhaps you should take up the quill
you're doing just fine
if you only mean to dupe me again 
you mean to take us all down with you?
he can't do that to me
how can one man possibly be so selfish?
what the devil 
perhaps  in time  you'll earn them back through good behavior 
you can't  you mustn't  i've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper 
start with the bible; it's cheerier and more artfully written
that monstrous god of yours? he strung up his very own son like a side of veal; i shudder to think what he'd do to me
i'll die of loneliness i've no company but the characters i create 
whyyyy he took down the gatling gun and the cannon all by himself
i have a proposition
you always do
madeleine she's besotted with me; she'd do anything i ask she could pay you a midnight visit 
i don't know who you insult more; her or me
"part the gates of heaven" as it were 
that's enough
you're tense darling you could use a long slow screw
good day marquis
my bed gone am i to freeze to death?
his rug
all we thought about was coming home i swore i'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again if i have to go to war with the railroad to stay fine by me
that's a turkish weave you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime 
virgin birth  ha an entire religion built on an oxymoron
orvolle his wine  from now on nothing but water at every meal 
 water 
why this sudden torture?
i didn't create this world of ours i only record it
its horrors perhaps its darkest nightmares and to what end? nothing but your own morbid gratification 
if it were up to the doctor you'd be flayed alive
a man after my own heart
what in god's name am i to do with you? the more i forbid the more you're provoked
think about this if we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
i could be convinced to abandon my writing quite voluntarily
what on earth would that require?
a night spent with the partner of my choice
you expect me to pimp madeleine?
off with your clothes
coulmier you animal
i do not mean to flirt marquis
oh but you must my pumpkin sex without flirtation is merely rape
it's a potent aphrodisiac isn't it? power over another man
oh i'm to be blamed now am i?
that just might work
your words drove bouchon to 
for fuck's sake abbe what am i to do? police my readers as you police me? suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? would you condemn the bible? i think not
an innocent child is dead
it's no secret that you loved her
oh that's rich  coming from her lapdog 
i saw the longing in your eye 
 that was lust 
don't confuse one organ with another 
i know because i felt it myself 
i wanted to fuck her that's all
"big and older"?
and did you?
it's not your province to ask
you're no stranger to rape marquis; and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged
go to hell
why was it you never took her by force?
who's to say i did not?
was it impotence?
never
i fucked her countless times in every orifice and all the while she plead for more 
i dare you stab my flesh which one of us will bleed?
you can shut up now
abbe de coulmier
i'm here
surely you'll grant me a final word
dr royercollard? may i be the first to welcome you to charenton 
this may feel a tad awkward my friend but it needn't be i've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
of course
it's a formality; truly
you're a man of science; i'm a man of god charenton stands to profit from us both i'm certain
i'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things
if you don't mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs?
and what do you think mendez?
you are a charmer
i understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction
indiscretions abbe? please i've read his case history at sixteen he violated a serving girl with a crucifix after six months in the dungeon at vincennes he mutilated a prostitute cutting her flesh with a razor then cauterizing the wounds with wax 
he's made a great success of our little theater; there's seldom an empty seat not to mention its therapeutic value
why is he in your care and not a proper prison?
his wife's influence
his wife's?
and he's never once attempted escape?
besides every wholesome thing he might desire he has at charenton a library filled with the world's great books music lessons watercolor exercises 
what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
he no longer roars or spits he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards 
i swear i'll shoot you in your sleep
oh that
well?
it's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind
do you favor its publication?
you have to believe me i had no idea 
all france is aghast at this book yet you've not heard of it?
i've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them
abbe i admire you; i do you've a conviction an idealism peculiar to the very young and so i'll be candid the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit the most severe instructions
unless we set charenton on a straight and narrow course she'll be shut down forever by order of the emperor
shut down?
she's still talking to jesus
in their eyes the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here
but he's one among some two hundred wards 
have you tried bleeding him with leeches? the calming chair? maybe you should flog him at the stake?
why? so he'll learn to fear punishment rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
you're a sentimental man
a practical man sir given the marquis' unusual tastes a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent
on the contrary let me take up this matter with the marquis myself 
and place my reputation at stake?
well?
i spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here
 if you stop saying things about my zee
and ?
he's more than a patient doctor; the marquis is my friend 
you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here 
i have
madame bougival; mademoiselle clairwil  and of course  the marquis' wife 
it was fiction of course
of course
it was not inspired by circumstance
you ought to be ashamed abbe exploiting those drooling pathetic cretins for financial gain 
that's not our intent 
you know him?
i'll do everything in my power 
you'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force
he'll do no such thing
it's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children 
this child let loose the beast from its cage 
if only blood will appease you then shed mine
as you say doctor
perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name
i beg you doctor don't make me say it
my my you have exceeded my expectations
i went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed the railroad doesn't even need our land they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can
and my own
how is the patient faring?
poorly
and you? it must've been an ordeal
i'm not the first man god has asked to shed blood in his name i will not be the last
will you sleep soundly tonight?
i've stared into the face of evil  and i've lived to tell the tale now for your own sake let me write it down
here it is; the last chapter
monsieur masse says he'd like another manuscript quick as you please he's got himself three presses and he can't print 'em fast enough
i'll pass the word on then
you ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
i'll pay you another visit with a share of the profits once its sold
i'll be waiting
you asked my name once; it's madeleine
at last she arrives my hardwon bride hurry my child and scurry inside there you'll find such treasures await you; marzipan and meringue to sate you
i'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more"
i tremble with fear you're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound
and then  to prove your truly mine  i'll plunder you darling from behind
what of my lips will you soil them too? when you've broken every other taboo?
if you won't read it to your own mama then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all
it's not your cup of tea mama
what do you think?
oh it's terrible it's too too terrible  well go on
"the vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge still he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman"
yes?
i'm only a laundress; not a detective
you're more than a priest; you're an angel ain't he maddy?
i'm hungry for a proper visit
don't start 
did i frighten you?
you? frighten me? that's a good one i'm twice as fast as you are who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
it's the only frontier i have left plumcake
you're looking a bit more spry now that somebody 
the peril of composing such incendiary prose
if only these coins purchased your other talents too
there's something else i want from you
you've already stolen my heart as well as another more prominent organ south of the equator
your publisher says i'm not to leave without a new manuscript
the unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass the darling of the lower wards where they entomb the criminally insane
is it awfully violent?
most assuredly
is it terribly erotic?
a kiss for each page
pinkertons it's the railroad
must i administer them directly or might i blow them?
the price my coquette is every bit as firm as i am
it's a long story this one
the climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap
the story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium
what have they done to you now?
my newest book begins at my right cuff continues across my back and completes itself at the base of my left shoe
they've taken your clothes?
surely you've seen a man naked
i must say in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations
well i surely know what a quadrant is  but i've never seen it used at night before
 we could move on rebuild make a decent life someplace else
the abbe's sending me away he fears for me here what with the likes of you 
don't be fooled madeleine he fears for himself he's like a man starving and you  ha  you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream 
he's a man of god; he's true to his vows
it needn't be; not if you've another story
how do you propose i write it? with dust upon the air?
yes; that's it a final volley from us both
go on child
tomorrow night whisper a new tale to your neighbor cleante he'll whisper it to his neighbor dauphin who'll whisper it to his neighbor franval 
 who'll whisper it to bouchon 
 whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet there armed with a quill of my own i'll commit it to paper
don't care
yes you shall of course you shall 
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined
yes i've got that bit
"your wife"
tell him i'm no fool a prison's still a prison even with chinese silk and chandeliers
"by the time you read this we'll be long gone; bound for england or points beyond"
tell him  if he uncovers our whereabouts  you'll slit your wrists with a razor and i'll plunge a hat pin through my heart
you'd do that rather than forsake our love?
it is customary to write first and request an appointment 
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy
didn't think you would  i'm going to go make the coffin
i beg to differ doctor you work in a madhouse your every waking moment is governed by the insane
i pray you: be succinct
you're new to charenton yes? perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband and his unusual case
i assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf
you're aware are you not that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton
i pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than i should
perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them
i am not a wealthy woman
but you've a pension haven't you from the sale of his books?
it's tainted money doctor
how'd it go in there?
what a beautiful thought marquise
what thought is that?
if you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity 
oh but i am
 words alone are insufficient
don't toy with me doctor
i am eternally in your debt
and i in yours
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick?
of course
fine how'd it go out here?
good god marquise 
this is neither the time nor the place 
if only you'd remained true to our contract opiates for his nerves restraints the man warrants a bed of nails 
you've no right to assault me in this fashion; i'll call for my footman i'll have you removed 
public scorn carries a terrible sting trust me i'm a woman who knows
it's libelous; you wouldn't dare
hm? tell me what other treats?
for fuck's sake woman bonbons? i'm to sit here gorging myself on useless trifles sucking down your little sweetmeats when what i truly need  what i truly require  are a few quill pens? perhaps a pot of ink?
how was i to know my darling?
i beg you donatien as your wife your only ally you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself
and i planned getting you off the hangman's deck 
you've come to lecture me?
to flaunt your deviance in public? upon a stage?
they've put you up to this haven't they?
everywhere i go they point and whisper at the opera they hiss at me when i take my box when i went to church the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said i was already damned why must i suffer for your sins?
it's the way of all martyrs isn't it?
tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? no have you petitioned the court? never sought audience with the emperor 
he refuses to be seen in my company he blanches at the mention of your name 
leave at once 
but it's just begun 
doesn't that please you?
and it's guarded by pinkerton detectives
very much
i'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon there we can sit sideby side before the fire
i'd rather read thankyou
ever met walter winchell?
no when i was but a tender lad
so you ever gonna do a picture?
not you too
it's gonna be fine orson you're gonna do great
i wonder sometimes
you're just scared
i don't think it's counterfeit do you mind if i take a look at all your real bills to compare?
of being found out of not being a genius
oh but haven't you heard? i'm the boy wonder i've been a genius since the moment i was born
we've known each other too long orson sling the bullshit elsewhere
carole you wound me as if i could hope to pacify you with evasions of
that poor woman
and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow tt teeth and i'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place so we set tttraps everywhere and every morning we would find the tttraps sprung but no mice
god these parties are the worst
you need to get outta here rapunzel
that's why he has the parties he says it's like bringing the world to me
why don't you come down to la? stay with us for a while
gents we are in the middle of something here
it's not so bad here after all what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
mr welles certainly is a caution
yeah orson's a real piece of work but deep down he's a good kid real deep down
and attractive in a hammy sort of way
listen you come down and stay with us for a few days just tell the old man that
i can't

when i met him i was just 20 and he was 55 i saw the gold ring and just grabbed on and he was going to make me a star
i did my best but well you know me

and director
i see and you are in california for what reason?
well i wish you luck it is a treacherous business
so i've been told
in hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed
i wonder do you have any idea what you have done?
do you?
intimately for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others i have been swimming in blood my entire life but i retain a belief perhaps you will think it old fashioned undoubtedly you will but i believe that private lives should not be public property
elegant words sir when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock i learned at the knee of the master
louis
this has been a good year
randolph
quite and this is why i came to visit have you heard about this citizen kane picture?
mm not a very good picture i am told
uhhub
apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself entirely too much like myself do you follow so far?
and maybe we could get mr warner and mr goldwyn and mr cohn and mr selznick to play as well
you know that can't happen
oh why is that?
why is that louis?
see what you can do about this citizen kane picture won't you?
jesse we're outlaws
goddamn it i gotta have some kinda life
there's no call for that language
this is supposed ta be siam or some such some kinda lousy bbbalinese temple this look like a temple to you? i can't see it myself
there that's right
she's a catholic she says it would put her soul in peril divorce is a very serious sin apparently
the journal was pretty harsh to roosevelt today
you oughta lay off him  he is the pppresident after all
he is a bolshevik he will have us at war by the end of the year i think i'm going to run that wheelchair picture
how bad is it?
nothing for you to worry about darling
and we're good at it
the sec has turned down my request for relief on the debts

marion

this picture
it got to you didn't it all the killing in the war you need it now
then you explain it to me?
there's nothing to explain
a million dollars a year on art and stststatues and there's nothing to explain?
i will not defend my life to you
i'm not asking you to defend anything but we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it
we are in no "pickle"  as you would euphemistically have it
you gotta wake up now pops
there is nothing to discuss
you don't have any money left okay? that's the truth i don't wanna say it nobody else will say it but it's the truth you spent it all you can't buy the tribune in chicago  you can't buy ^ gg goddamn thing now you better face up to it
you are being typically theatrical marion i need the tribune to
you've killed your fair share of men
that  did you need that? how much did that cost?
it's 12th century from deauville  in france
i know where deauville is for ccchrist's sake
you needn't use that language with me
did you need it? did you need any of it?
i wanted it
there's a different between want and
not for me
that's right you've captured me exactly goodnight
you will not walk out on me
if i could go back to farming 
you are repellant when you drink
tough shit we need to tttalk about this
fuck you mr kane
i will not have this in my home
i just want to understand
no you don't you want to condemn me like everyone else you want to point to the pathetic old man grown lunatic with his spending  trapped in his ridiculous
castle  still fighting old battles he will never win with pulitzer and roosevelt and hollywood
i don't want you to
it's all you it has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with pulitzer and the castle and  marion
how so?
that's a lie you could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen
the jigsaw puzzles and the urn career  the man spending a fortune to make her a star  only it's opera and not movies and
yes?
thank you for your time
miss parsons i have one additional question for you
sir? 
why did we not know about this sooner?
sir?
i pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in hollywood do i not? if you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me
sir i
he lied to me
i can't quit and leave you alone i can't quit until you quit ma would've wanted it that way
he looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you
i want blood
"well if you got drunk to talk to me about miss alexander don't bother i'm not interested i've set back the sacred cause of reform is that it? all right if that's the way they want it the people have made their choice it's obvious the people prefer jim gettys to me"
keep filming
i can't remember the lines
this is the chance you've been waiting for boy tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him
you're not going to get another chance boy look right at the monster and you tell him
"you don't care about anything except you you just want to persuade people that you
love them so much that they ought to love you back only you want love on your own terms "
tome it's a question of truth and illusion don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
we're doing this for ma
huh?
now orson you know i'm just dyin' to see your picture and i know it's gonna be boffo but you're writing about a publisher right?
we're using
you're not doin' hearst are you?
good god no the character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons
that's right a symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellersoftruth those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties
orson hold on look into my eyes tell me you are not doing hearst
schaefer i gotta see this welles picture
louella hello i was just fixing a drink would you like?
you drink at 10 am do you?
what's he doing?
maybe it started out that way but now
no  no  i mean
i wanna see the picture today
that might be a tad difficult because orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music
cut the malarkey buddy the boss himself wants me to see the picture today
he personally asked you to?
hearst?
that's right fella no hearst paper will run an rko ad until you agree that citizen kane will never see the light of day
louella please be reasonable i understand you have problems with orson's picture but maybe we can work something out
nix sweetie you shelve it
oh for god's sake louella
what do you want me to say frank? i was killing men when i was fifteen i like getting shot at i like riding out of town with a posse at my back this is a helluva better life than farming
and mr hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture he'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to new york and do shakespeare with the boy wonder
can i talk to hearst?
i don't know what you expected with joseph fuckingconrad for chrissake i mean this is hollywood pal
all right enough i've heard this from schaefer and rko i've heard it from everyone
but you keep coming up with the same elitist crap   heart of darkness with a million dollar budget?   no one wants to see that
what are movies about orson?
forget it
what are movies about?
telling stories
nope
we're drunk
showing life
magic
butts on seats that's what movies are about you got one job in hollywood  everyone has the same job in fact  putting the butts on the seats you gotta sell 'em popcorn and pepsi cola it's all about popcorn and pepsicola
not for me
then you better get ready to be the youngest never was in hollywood history
that's better than being the oldest hasbeen in hollywood history
so we've got to come up with our movie our biography
right
we find the man and then we dissect him
like a bug
oh yeah
but with compassion and insight
how about howard hughes? we could do hughes
i'm not fucking with hughes that shitkicker would kill us dead baby just like jean harlow
howard hughes killed jean harlow?
sigmund freud?
manolete?
who the hell's manolete?
the great spanish bullfighter
i don't wanna write about no spic
the man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? this is monstrous
you taking sides against me now frank?
the old man has his own way of doing things
look at those hands those are the hands of an artist a modern caravaggio
"in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree   "how big is it all told? the estate?
the whole joint is half the size of rhode island
jesus
mank you scoundrel what took you so long?
here you are up with the birds for once you vampire
okay boy wonder what?
oh for christ's sake
i know who we're going to get i the great american biography a journey into the soul of the beast
they're all pinned down can't even get to the door
this better be good
image a man that has shaped his time a titanic figure of limitless influence think about empire a man with an empire at his feet a man like a baron living in a palace a glorious palace on a hill and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him feudal
oh christ
image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his
yes
please don't say this
mank
don't whisper it don't even think it
how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses  every single day in the newspapers and on the radio  waiting for us in that ridiculous castle waiting for
now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from
shoulda learned with web made it look fun made it look like an adventure got web killed now jim
listen to you you child men like him don't bother with things like legality they don't have to you know why boyo?   power   power like you couldn't even begin to imagine
howard hughes he would just kill us hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved
you may think you know what you're talking about kid but believe me you don't you're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and hollywood that hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you when he flicks you away with one finger i'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine hell
so speaks the court jester
fuck you
i expected more from you
sorry to disappoint
i remember a man who wrote i he was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight
don't do this
where did he go? he hasn't had a screen credit in four years
jim was old enough
don't do this
let me out
listen to me
fuck you
i am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again
i don't have it anymore?
when i was a kid i wanted to scorch the world too   i had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories but all that's finished for me
it doesn't have to be
and yeah sure hearst's a great subject been keeping notes on him for years for my   great american novel but i can't do it anymore no studio's gonna hire me and i  
i'll hire you   right now
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west how was he supposed to say no to that?
i can't do it okay? i drink too much  i drink all the fucking time and i don't have it anymore all that is over for me
he'll destroy us
so who is he? we have to know him
everyone sees someone different that's what we show
how?
the key  the key  the clue  what does this man recall on his death bed? okay mank you're dying what's the last image that comes to you? right now
this girl on a dock white dress never said a word to her
why her?
all men love but men like hearst  they don't bother with convention because
they don't have to
railroad burned him out too you couldn't have stopped him
hearst looks down at the world at his feet everything has always been beneath him
and what does he see?
the people when they pay him homage he adores them but when they have the  audacity to question him to doubt him to embarrass him then he despises them
it's 350 pages long
yeah but the margins are real wide
it's good huh?
good? good? words fail you at last it's terrific now i'll have to do some shaping of course and some of the scenes aren't exactly    exactly   
what?
short enough but this is a grand start and i think we need to change the name
the title?
he's drawing an isthmus he's saying we're on an isthmus
you're a pisspoor liar for the smartest man i know
no american is a blessed title directly sent from god's soul to your mind we shall never change that i mean the name of the publisher charles foster craig doesn't have the knivesout poetry i need i was thinking about "kane"  you like that?
cain  like the bible guy?
kane one strong syllable kane i
craig is one syllable
i um i don't know if i should i ain't been drinking since i started on this
jesus christ 
and i'm looking at them  and they're all looking at me and i don't know who should pour the tea '
uh huh
i want you back
fuck you  you wanted me out i'm out
yeah
i'm sorry
did i ever tell you about my father?
i don't give a shit about
hey kid gregg
mank sit down you missed the opening of the new picture but i'll go back
no but i can imagine what am i today? a "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante"  no she wouldn't know how to spell that
"and how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real americans? doesn't hollywood know there's a depression on? don't real americans deserve work?"
well at least she's off kane today
no she's not don't you get it ya lunk? she's using code language to the studio bosses "bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees"  who the hell do you think she's talking about?
hedy lamarr?
a war against the railroad what the hell were we thinking?
who owns this town? who runs every goddamn studio? the tribe baby these fuckers hear the word "jew" and they start sweating like ester williams' pool they start sweating
so they're jews  
this is just the first shot maestro sooner or later she's gonna use the word and all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the jews
christ
me i'm proud to be a jew i got no problem you don't like it fuck you but with these guys it's like a dirty word all they wanna be is good red whiteandblue americans and the way they see it you can't be a good american and a jew so sam goldfish becomes sam goldwyn and david selznick becomes david 0 selznick  like anyone's gonna think he's irish for fuck's sake
what does this have to do with?
believe you me they're gonna do anything  and i mean absolutely anything  to stop that word from gettin' out
if he had known about kane before you made it you'd be dead already
it's too late the movie's made
they won't let it out not hearst not the other studio heads
i'll meet you down there in a few weeks
you wrote the damn thing mank aren't you going to fight for it?
is that from one of the gospels?
you stupid little man how could you have let this happen? i gave you my soul and now you're going to sell it?
you gonna watch?
hell i know how it ends  hey rosebud's the sled
mank
shit
what have i done?
you know all this nightmare we went through with hearst the whole thing and in the end probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway
he truly doesn't care if he ever works again
see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
they came to me with an offer 800000 for the negative and all the prints
and they went to the stockholders in new york
oh god
monstro ran into walter winchell outside he wants to play herod in the picture hiya george
herman
may i help you?
i um need an estimate on some jewelry i might wish to sell but dddiscretion is very important to me bbbecause i don't want anyone ttto um know that
excuse me i hope this isn't rude but aren't you marion davies?
yes
well this is a great pleasure miss davies i just saw that enchantment is playing at a the tivoli the revival house in santa monica that was a fine picture
y'know uncle frank
thank you
not one of them today has what you had miss davies not one of them
thank you  bbbut i'd really like ttto
of course of course how can we be of service?
as i said i have some jjjj  that i might wish ttto sell and i wanted an estimate
it came
800000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more hell george you even make a profit on the deal
very generous
and we gotta be clear here i need the negative and every existing print
to do what?
yeah jimmy?
that's for me to decide
you're going to destroy it
no maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it
you're lying to me
you talked to new york?
yes
yes
get out
you're bettin' on an inside straight this time you'll never pull it off
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
every time you tell that story you stop there that's not how it ended i was five when my dad got shot
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud"
"rosebud? i'll tell you about rosebud
it's an awful title of course but i can't think of anything better someone came up with a sea of upturned faces  which has a nice grand ring to it  and i thought of john citizen usa but that strikes me as a bit warner brothers or god forbid capraesque i suppose american will do for now but
citizen kane
pardon?
a "z" and a "k" in the title that would draw the eye for the poster i like that the prisoner of zenda had a "z" and a "p" and that worked
now look orson let's not get ahead of ourselves the budget projections on this
i know i know but what more can you expect of me? i have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to
allow a man his version of the past when you get to be my age you've got enough painful memories you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up
now don't have a fit  but i want you to think again about doing war of the worlds
jesus
do war of the worlds as a feature and everyone's happy you make some money and new york's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to kane
please don't ask me to do this
for the title
this is an abomination there's no music and
they've all seen a rough cut
the magazines are one thing  but hedda why did we have to let her come?
and this is the evening edition notice anything?
what do you want me to do orson? radio city won't premiere the picture louella threatened them with some bullshit about
sounds like he was a hell of a man
then find another theater
you don't think i've tried? no one is willing to open the picture
listen to me the press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it and meantime i'm dealing with the stockholders in new york who are scared shitless  and i'm this far from getting fired myself  and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now so you have got to trust that i'll do what i can to
"do what you can"? that's not good enough i
well it' s all you've got 
you're with them aren't you? you're going to bury my movie they bought you
for christ's sake shut up
why don't you just have the guts to admit it
how dare you talk to me like that do you think i'm like all the rest of those pirates? like mayer and warner? is that what you think?
it's just that my movie is so
where can i meet this man?
that he was
do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing? for cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?
that soulless monster gets no tears from me
this isn' t some kinda fucking game you know how many people rko employs? you know how many people depend on what we do for a living?
i really think you're
you wanna commit suicide fine you got some death wish fine but you will not drag this company down with you
you're not still mad at me i hope
no we're jake but listen
look not a single scene shot in the studio we've found natural locations for the whole story
hold on a sec i got news we finally found somewhere to premiere kane but
i told you where? grauman's? el capitan? or did radio city come crawling back?
they're making him a hero now
i think you better sit down
it's my birthday this week i'll be 26
oh god  
you know something orson you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met but ya know i'd do it again in a second
it was fun wasn't it?
it was the best kid
so on to the life of christ
orson you wanna take five?
it's just not low enough this is the scene we have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky as towering virtues in combat
spare me the aria i know what you want
saved a lot of folk from the railroad
i need my shoes in total focus right here and also joe back there

jake did i ever make you look bad before?
why not? there's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid i don't see why i shouldn't have a shot at the title right now
jesse are you awake?
well the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing in new york and they're saying that you don't cooperate
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time?
i'm pulling out of next wednesday's tv bout 'cause i can't make the weight i'm fighting at light heavyweight and i still can't make the weight

positive
hey you don't say goodbye to him like that
what did i do?
you don't kiss like that hello and goodbye that's all you do
all i did

i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate
all right lemme ask you something let's say i was a good friend of yours and i was telling you i was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this janiro fight what would you tell me?
salvy would i steer you wrong? let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes right? now two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there  take the cigarettes out sell 'em make some cash
hey but joey you're thinking nickels and dimes the money's with your brother
what do you want from my life salvy? he's my brother
hey leave the kids alone
i can't convince him he's got such a thick head i'd like to crack it open myself believe me my own brother it's very hard you don't have to convince me  i know we should be with tommy you talk to him he don't listen to nobody
talk some sense into him will ya? you're still his brother if he ain't gonna listen to you he ain't gonna listen to nobody
all right i'll try see you later
tomorrow at the gym don't forget
i said let's go
a river pirate
joey relax you're taking this the wrong way why don't you sit down and have a drink?
excuse me i'm talking to my sister inlaw
excuse me for living
what do you think i'm blind? my brother's breaking his ass in a ring and you're here with his wife
hey joey whadda ya lookin' to die young?
what're you doin' with salvy? you shouldn't be here with him jake's away killin' himself suppose he found out
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training i can't go out? what am i a goddamn prisoner?
no you're his wife
i'm not doing anything wrong i'm just trying to have a good time do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
it don't look right
arr hand over your jewels missy
well go ahead tell jake he's gonna kill me anyway it's a matter of time
i'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out he will kill you what's the matter with you? aren't you happy? you got everything you want
you don't sleep with him i do i don't get to breathe without tellin' him he keeps me in a cage if he thinks i'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way i get used as a punching bag he don't trust nobody if he saw the two of us talking together right now you'd be in trouble too  believe me look at me joey i'm 19 years old i wanna enjoy my life i love jake but you don't know he gets crazy sometimes i'm scared
try to understand vickie jake's got a lotta aggravation he's been a top contender too long
that's right take his part you're his brother he's never gonna be champ too many people are against him
and you're drinking with them right now
this is doyle's house
this is the baby sitter
oh when are they expected home?
i'm hired 'til one they went to dinner and maybe nightclubbing
thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that didn't you?
well if he calls in tell him to get in touch with l b jefferies right away i might have quite a surprise for him
does he have your number mr jefferies?
he has it thank you
indochina  jeff predicted it would go skyhigh
from the looks of davidson's cable it might even go higher than that and we haven't even got a camera over there
this could go off in a month  or an hour
i'll pull somebody out of japan
bryce the only man for this job is sitting right here in town  get me l b jefferies
jefferies?
name me a better photographer
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
but his leg
it was in her favorite handbag  and mr doyle that can lead to only one conclusion
like disposing of their wives?
of course it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope
mrs  thorwald's  clothes  clean  carefully packed  not too stylish  but presentable
i would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back
you didn't see the killing or the body? how do you know there was a murder?
because everything that man's done has been suspicious trips at night in the rain saws knives trunks with rope and a wife that isn't there any more
i'll admit it all has a mysterious sound  but is could mean a number of different things murder is the least likely
it's too stupid and obvious a way to murder  in full view of fifty windows  and then sit over there    smoking a cigar  waiting for the police to pick him up
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james?
well officer  do your duty
you've got a lot to lean about homicide jeff morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them that salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage
i'll bet it's been done
almost everything's been done  under panic but this is a thousand to one shot that man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked
you think i made all this up?
i think you saw something  that probably has a very simple explanation
for instance?
his wife took a trip
she  was  an  invalid
you told me  i've got to run jeff
not if i find the right girl
i  uh  won't report it to the department let me poke into a little on my own no point in you getting any ridiculous publicity
thanks
we know the wife is gone i'll see if i can find out where
by the way  what happened to your leg?
he has a six months lease and has used up a little over five and a half months of it  quiet drinks but not to drunkenness pays his bill promptly with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman  wholesale keeps to himself and none of the neighbors got close to him or his wife
i think they missed their chance with her
she never left the apartment 
then where is she  in the ice box?
 until yesterday morning
what time?
and what's this right girl like?
i think that's about the time i fell asleep
feel a little foolish?
who said they left then?
who left  where?
the building superintendent and two tenants flat statements  no hesitation and they all jibed to the letter the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station
now how could anybody guess that? they had perhaps signs on their luggage "grand central or bust"?
the superintendent met thorwald coming back he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country
a very convenient guy  this superintendent have you checked his bank deposits lately?
jeff  huh?
well  what good is his information? it's a secondhand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself  thorwald anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
smart funny bossy always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
i hate to remind you  but this all started because you said she was murdered now did anyone including you actually see her murdered?
doyle  are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish?
if possible  both
well then do a good job of it get over there and search thorwald's apartment it must be kneedeep in evidence
i can't do that
i mean when he goes out for a paper or a drink or something what he doesn't know won't hurt him
i can't do it even if he's gone
what's the matter? does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
now don't get me mad even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it if i were ever caught in there i'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes
just make sure you're not caught if you find something you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules if you find nothing  he's clear
where will you find such a girl?
at the risk of sounding stuffy jeff  i'll remind you of the constitution and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim he must ask for evidence
give him evidence
i can hear myself starting out "your honor  i have a friend who's an amateur sleuth an one night after a heavy supper "  he'd throw the new york state penal code right in my face  and it's six volumes
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment
a detective's nightmare
what do you need before you can search  bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
one thing i don't need is heckling you called and asked me for help  and now you're acting like a taxpayer
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
you know every day for three years i asked myself that same question?
ever get an answer?
ahem "from this doctrine" no ah "from women's eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still like  shiny sparkling rocks"
forget the story  find the trunk mrs thorwald's in it
is  is anna  who i think it is?
enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time and we'd lose him
you think he's getting out of here?
jewelry?
he has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there
that wasn't mrs thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
did you ever own a saw?
well in the garage back home we 
but i'm not a killer
sparkling rocks?
if i'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal a big job fame money 
oh  that phone call  i gave them your number  hope you don't mind
that depends on who "they" were
jefferies
this is doyle jeff
tom i've got something real big for you
look jeff don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be 
listen to me lisa's been arrested
your lisa?
my lisa she went into thorwald's apartment and he came back the only way i could get her out was to call the police
little ones
i told you that 
i know what you told me she went in to get evidence and she came out with it
like what?
like mrs thorwald's wedding ring if that woman were still alive she'd be wearing it
a possibility
a fact last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden why? because he had something buried in there something a dog could scent
like an old hambone?
i don't know what pet name thorwald had for his wife and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase he wasn't taking his possessions because they're up in his apartment now
you think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
in sections and one other thing doubting tom  it just occurred to me that all the calls thorwald made were long distance if he called his wife the day she left  after she arrived in merritsville  why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
is this one of frank's shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
where'd they take lisa?
precinct six i sent a friend over with bail money
just don't dally thorwald knows he's being watched he won't hang around long
jefferies
congratulations jeff
for what?
for getting rid of that cast
this is wednesday
gunnison  how did you get to be such a big editor  with such a small memory?
wrong day?

yep
wrong week next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon

were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
swell i get myself halfkilled for you  and you reward me by stealing my assignments
i didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track
you asked for something dramatically different you got it
so did you goodbye jeff
read some good books
i've been taking pictures so long i don't know how to read anymore
i'll send you some comic books
listen  if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom  i'll do something drastic
like what?
i'll  i'll get married then i'll never be able to go anywhere
i am so sorry jesse
it's about time you got married  before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man
can you see me  rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry the electric dishwasher the garbage disposal and a nagging wife
yeah? maybe in the high rent districts they discuss  but in my neighborhood they still nag
well  you know best call you later jeff
hello
gunnison?
yeah is that you jeff?
it's me
something wrong?
the word is "everything" now what time does my plane leave tuesday?
you and i we've started something you know?  i don't know what'll happen if you do this
jeff 
i don't care where it goes  just as long as i'm on it
okay indochina tuesday we'll pick you up
that's more like it goodnight old buddy
hello
well  did you get it thorwald?
who are you?
i'll give you a chance to find out meet me in the bar at the brevoort  and do it right away
why should i?
for a little business meeting  to settle the estate of your late wife
me neither
i don't know what you mean
now stop wasting time thorwald or i'll hang up and call the police
i only have a hundred dollars or so
can you get me that ring back?
no
i can't the police have it by now
readers' digest april 1939
i predicted it
stella  in economics a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market absolutely none
right now i'd even welcome trouble
let the law 
you've got a hormone deficiency
how can you tell that from a thermometer
i knew it
don't you ever heat that stuff up
gives your circulation something to fight  what kind of trouble?
lisa fremont
you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood
she expects me to marry her
that's normal
i don't want to
laws don't touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
that's abnormal
i'm not ready for marriage
nonsense a man is always ready for marriage  with the right girl and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open
behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause  what is it? you have a fight?
no
her father loading up the shotgun?
stella
it's happened before you know some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say
she's just not the girl for me
she's only perfect
whose justice? yours or god's?  when will you stop?
too perfect too beautiful too talented too sophisticated too everything  but what i want
it's very simple she belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of park avenue expensive restaurants and literary cocktail parties
people with sense can belong wherever they're put
you're never going to marry?
the only honest thing to do is call it off let her look for somebody else
i can just hear you now "get out of here you perfect wonderful woman you're too good for me"
look mr jefferies i'm not educated i'm not even sophisticated but i can tell you this  when a man and a woman see each other and like each other  they should come together  wham like two taxies on broadway not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle
there's an intelligent way to approach marriage
we've progressed emotionally in 
baloney once it was see somebody get excited get married  now it's read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
zee
people have different emotional levels that 
when i married myles we were both maladjusted misfits we still are and we've loved every minute of it
okay  but i'm going to spread some common sense on the bread lisa fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you i'll give you two words of advice marry her
the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair
how did you know
eyes bloodshot must have been staring out the window for hours
i was
what'll you do if one of them catches you?
keep your mind off her
she's real eat drink and be merry girl
jesse what are you thinking? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
and she'll end up fat alcoholic and miserable
speaking of misery miss lonely hearts drank herself to sleep again alone
poor girl someday she'll find her happiness
and some man will lose his
isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
well the salesman could be available soon
he and his wife splitting up?
it's hard to figure he went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case
isn't he a salesman?
now what could he sell at three in the morning?
you think i don't know that?
i don't understand
flashlights luminous dials for watches house numbers that light up
his personal effects he's probably running away  the coward
sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run
what about this morning? any developments?
no the shades are still drawn in their apartment
a federal offense
i'm not shy i've been looked at before
goodbye mr jefferies i'll see you tomorrow
stella i  i can't tell you what a welcome sight this is no wonder your husband's still in love with you
police?
she's the most wonderful woman in the world can't get her out of my mind
huh?
you called the police?
i'm just going to get the name of their truck
mrs thorwald?
you mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
there's a dip at this end and since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
you shouldn't have let her do that if he ever 
thank heaven that's over
i wonder
what?
that's wonderful it's just i thought
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules
you can tell that from here?
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter
would four of them  ?
no  but it makes the rest easy to take and she's reading the bible
you know? you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all
what are you two talking about?
got a shovel?
no
there's probably one in the basement
i would never have imagined us in a place like this
you know miss fremont  he might just have something there
what's she trying to do? why doesn't she turn him in?
smart girl
smart? she'll be arrested
when you took your first snapshot  did you ever think it would bring you to this?
stella  how long do you think he'll stay there?
what do you need money for?
one hundred and twentyseven
how much do you think you'll need?
ten here
that's why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
thirtythree here totals oneninety not enough
what about the rest?
hello
mrs doyle?
yes
jeff again  has tom come in yet?
not yet jeff
you haven't even heard from him?
it is something really important jeff?
i'm afraid it is tess
are you going to be happy here mr james? without all that excitement?
i'll have him call the moment i hear from him
tell him not to waste time calling to get over here soon as he can i think thorwald's pulling out tonight
who's thorwald?
he knows  don't worry tess it's a man
goodnight you idiot
how's your leg?
mmmm  hurts a little
and your stomach?
empty as a football
and you love life?
i've got you you keep me busy i figure we'll get over to the hotel get checked in cleaned up then i'd like to do something i've been thinking about for a long time
not too active
anything else bothering you?
the lisa fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
depends on the quote let's see  there's the plane tickets over import duties hidden taxes profit markups 
 a steal at eleven hundred dollars
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange
we sell a dozen a day in this price range
something big going on somewhere?
going on right here it's a big night
it's opening night of the last depressing week of l b jefferies in a cast
hmm
picked it up in shanghai  which has also seen better days
it's cracked  and you never use it and it's too ornate i'm sending up a plain flat silver one  with just your initials engraved
now that's no way to spend your hard earned money
what would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
big enough?
i couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through and the last week must be the hardest
yeah  i want to get this thing off and get moving
what a day i've had
tired?
not a bit i was all morning in a sales meeting then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne  just over from paris with some spy reports back to the "21" for lunch with the harper's bazaar people  that's when i ordered dinner then two fall showings  twenty blocks apart then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward  we're trying to get his next show  then i had to dash back and change
"hmm" what?
tell me  what was slim hayward wearing?
you can't buy that kind of publicity
that's good news
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
jeff  isn't it time you came home? you could pick your assignment
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
you mean leave the magazine?
yes
for what?
i beg your pardon?
don't laugh  i could do it
that's what i'm afraid of  could you see me  driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep  wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit
that's what is know as "manless melancholia"
miss lonely hearts at least that's something you'll never have to worry about
oh? you can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
well she picked the most prosperous looking one
she's not in love with him  or any of them
how can you tell that  from here?
oh some songwriter in the studio apartment lives alone probably had an unhappy marriage
where've you been?
we're lost
"blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james" only a dime in the hotel lobby
almost as if it were being written especially for us
if you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth because you're hiding something from me then maybe i can understand 
there's nothing i'm hiding it's just that 
it doesn't make sense to me what's so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
some people can now if you'll let me explain 
what is it but traveling from one place to another taking pictures? it's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation
all right that's your opinion you're entitled to it but 
lisa simmer down  will you?
you can't fit in here  i can't fit in there according to you people should be born live an die on the same 
did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
let me see that
of course not
oh i do that all the time whenever i have a few minutes after lunch
those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle  and those nylons and sixounce lingerie 
three
huh? try and find a raincoat in brazil even when it isn't raining  lisa on this job you carry one suitcase your home is the available transportation you sleep rarely bathe even less and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive
jeff you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me i'm wrong
you don't think either one of us could ever change?
and it's deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it  is to take out a subscription to your magazine i guess i'm not the girl i thought i was
there's nothing wrong with you lisa you have the town in the palm of your hand
not quite  it seems  goodbye jeff
oh i'm not finished  "when he sauntered into a saloon his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple"  as i said hmm
you mean "goodnight"
can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
i'm not exactly on the other side of the room
don't you ever have any problems?
i have one now
so do i
tell me about it
why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase? and come back three times?
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home
not that salesman's wife and why didn't he go to work today?
now sweetie y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels would you?
homework it's more interesting
what's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
nothing thank heaven
why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
i wouldn't dare answer that
what do you think?
jeff  if you could only see yourself
now lisa 
sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing  but doing it the way you are    with with binoculars and with wild opinions about every little movement you see  is is diseased
do you think i consider this recreation?
jesse have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy?
i don't know what you consider it  but if you don't stop it i'm getting out of here
you'd better before you catch the disease
what is it you're looking for?
i want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife does that make me sound like a madman?
what makes you think something's wrong with her?
a lot of things she's an invalid who needs constant care  and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day
maybe she died
where's the doctor  the undertakers?
lisa please
there's nothing to see
aw shucks ma'am
there is  i've seen things through that window bickering family fights mysterious trips at night knives saws rope  and since last evening not a sight or sound of his wife now you tell me where she is and what she's doing
maybe he's leaving his wife i don't know and i don't care lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses lots of men don't speak to their wives all day lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts  but very very very few of them end up in murder  if that's what you're thinking
it's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
you could see all the things he did couldn't you?
what are you getting at?
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard?
yeah
jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that? that he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
that's where he's being clever acting nonchalant
no comment
stop it this is just sad
don't you see how silly you're being?
the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr and mrs lars that's lars lars thorwald
what's the apartment house number?
okay chief what's my next assignment
to get on home
it doesn't seem to be in any hurry
that alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost 
what about it?
he had it hidden in the dresser well at least it was in there he took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance  his wife's jewelry was in the handbag and something about it worried him he was asking somebody advice over the phone
someone not his wife?
don't turn around
i wonder where he's going now?
i don't know
suppose he doesn't come back again?
well i guess it's safe to put on some lights now
all day long i've tried to keep my mind on work
thinking about thorwald?
and you and you friend doyle   did you hear from him again  since he left?
something on your mind lisa?
it doesn't make sense to me
what doesn't?
what?
women aren't that unpredictable
a woman has a favorite handbag  it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it then she takes a trip and leaves it behind why?
but only her husband would know that  and the jewelry women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse all tangled getting scratched and twisted up
do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
they do not and they don't leave it behind them a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry
inside stuff?
basic equipment you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag
i'm with you sweetie but detective thomas j doyle has a pat answer for that
that mrs thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
that's what the witnesses told him
you get arrested again i'll kill you
well i have a pat rebuttal for mr doyle  that couldn't be mrs thorwald  or i don't know women
still  those witnesses
i'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him he doesn't sound like much of a detective
don't be too hard on him he's a steady worker i wish he'd get there though
we have all  what?
night i'm going to stay with you
i have the whole weekend off
say anything else and i'll stay tomorrow night too
you said i'd have to live out of one suitcase  i'll bet yours isn't this small?
that's a suitcase?
the land is there  i know it
yes ma'am
i'll trade you  my feminine intuition for a bed for the night
from his landlord  once a month
it's utterly beautiful  i wish i could be creative
you are you have a talent for creating difficult situations
i do?
surprise  is the most important element of attack  and beside you're not up on your private eye literature when they're in trouble it's always their girl friday who gets them out of it
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls and overpassionate daughters of the rich
the same
but he never ends up marrying her strange
weird  why don't i slip into something comfortable?
i can't believe i had to blow up a train for you
you mean  like the kitchen? and make us some coffee?
i hate funny exit lines
do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars and a long focus lens  until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck and almost read his mail  do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
i'm not much on rear window ethics
of course they have the same chance they can look at me like a bug under glass if they want to
jeff  if anybody walked in here i don't think they'd believe what they see
huh?
whatever happened to that old saying "love thy neighbor"
did mr doyle think i stole this case
i'll rephrase the question
you are a hell of a woman
do you like it?
for a minute doyle almost had me convinced i was wrong
but you're not?
do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
is he cleaning house?
well?
it's just a picture of the backyard that's all
something's in there those flowers have been taken up and put back again
wasn't that close?
suppose mrs thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag  during that phone conversation he held up three rings  one with a diamond  one with a big stone of some kind  and one plain gold band
don't swear
jeff if you're squeamish just don't look
what for?
i'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes
how?
chelsea 27099  we scared him once maybe we can scare him again  i'm using that word "we" a little too freely i guess i don't take any of the chances
get an ambulance  don't move try to lie still
lisa  i  i  can't tell you how scared i was that you  you might 
shut up i'm all right
a man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street second floor rear make it fast

thanks
it doesn't matter how  i was driving a stolen car
do you enjoy doing this to me or what
momi'm not
i told you dad it was a question of honor  they called me chicken you know chicken  i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again  so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other  we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff  i got out okay but buzz didn't  he was killed
good lord
what about the other boysdo you think they'll go to the police?
what's that got to do with it?
no  i don't want you to go to the police  there were other people and why should you be the only one involved
he's not saying that  he's saying don't volunteer
well it doesn't matter anyhow because we're moving
jesus maria  i should have never listened to you
i'd just as soon kill you jesse james but chasing you takes up too much of my time
no  you're not tearing me loose any more
do i have to spell it out?
jimmy you're very youngand a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life
someone should put poison in her epsom salts
get lost
hang loose boy  i'm warning you
wash up and go home
too bad you didn't connect  you could have gone to juvenile hall that's what you want isn't it?
no
sure it is  you want to bug us till we have to lock you up  why?
this is unusual most of our marriages are members of the congregation
leave me alone
no
i don't know why
go ondon't give me that  someone giving you hard looks?
you feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
all the time  i don't know what gets into mebut i keep looking for trouble and i alwaysi swear you better lock me up  i'm going to smash somebodyi know it
that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want toi know about it anyway routine check
and they think they are protecting my by moving
you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there why did you do it?
he called me chicken
the lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable  "jesse woodson james" jesse james? the jesse james?
and your folks didn't understand?
they never do
so then you moved?
they think i'll make friends if we move  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine
things pretty tough for you at home?
what a zoo
what?
a zoo  he always wants to be my pal you know?  but how can i give him anything when he'si mean i love him and i don't want to hurt himbut i don't know what to do anymore except maybe die
pretty mixed up?
if he could
i could have lied i suppose but i want this marriage to be legal i just want you to know i'm trying to start a new life here i'm depending on your
"if he could" what?  you mean your father?
i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she'd be happy and i bet she'd stop picking  they make mush out of him  just mush one thing i know is i never want to be like him
chicken?
how can anyone grow up in this circus?
you got me jimbut they do  want some water?
boyif i had one day when i didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everythingor i felt i belonged some place
here  look will you do something for me?  if the pot starts boiling again will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? even if you just want to talkcome in and shoot the breeze  it's easier sometimes than talking to your folks
okay
any timeday or night  you calmed down enough to go back now?

is he your friend?
yes  my best friend
what's he like?
oh i don't know  you have to get to know him  he doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it  he's sincere

you see what i been puttin' up with? as soon as i walk through the door i'm hit with this shit i tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and mr white whips out his gun sticks it in my face and starts screaming "you motherfucker i'm gonna blow you away blah blah blah"
i told 'em not to touch the alarm they touched it i blew 'em full of holes if they hadn't done what i told 'em not it they'd still be alive
that's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
hey just cancel that shit right now you're hurt you're hurt really fucking bad but you ain't dying
"the gang made off with thirtyfive thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land"  who wrote this? i'll see him hanged every tuesday for a month
all this blood is scaring the shit outta me i'm gonna die i know it

what happened?
uhuh uhuh what's i tell ya? that sick piece of shit was a stone cold psycho
have you guys been listening to k billy's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
yeah it's fuckin' great isn't it?
can you believe the songs they been playin'?
i'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers
no i can't you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeatit's lovebeat" by little tony defranco and the defranco family i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin' grade
c'mon throw in a buck
uhuh i don't tip
whaddaya mean you don't tip?
i don't believe in it
i don't even know a jew who'd have the balls to say that so let's get this straight you never ever tip?
i'd go over twelve percent for that
these ladies aren't starvin' to death they make minimum wage when i worked for minimum wage i wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy
do you know what this is? it's the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses
you don't have any idea what you're talking about these people bust their ass this is a hard job
hardly farmers i've done some checking all these were in the war these men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them they are disciplined welltrained and have a charismatic leader if i were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what i would create
waitressing is the number one occupation for female noncollege graduates in this country it's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on the reason is because of tips
gun shot
oh that's just fucking great where's brown?
dead
goddamn goddamn how did he die?
how the fuck do you think? the cops shot him
oh this is bad this is so bad  is it bad?
as opposed to good?
this is so fucked up somebody fucked us big time
you really think we were set up?
so you can't tell me anything?
you even doubt it? i don't think we got set up i know we got set up i mean really seriously where did all those cops come from huh? one minute they're not there the next minute they're there i didn't hear any sirens the alarm went off okay okay when an alarm goes off you got an average of four minutes response time unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that particular moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there all loaded for bear all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? those were the ones responding to the alarm but those other motherfuckers were already there they were waiting for us  you haven't thought about this?
i haven't had a chance to think first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there and after we got away i've just been dealin' with him
well you better start thinking about it cause i sure as fuck am thinking about it in fact that's all i'm thinking about i came this close to just driving off whoever set us up knows about this place there could've been cops sitting here waiting for me for all we know there's cops driving fast on their way here now
what the fuck am i doing here? i felt funny about this job right off as soon as i felt it i should said "no thank you" and walked but i never fucking listen every time i ever got burned buying weed i always knew the guy wasn't right i just felt it but i wanted to believe him if he's not lyin' to me and it really is thai stick then whoa baby but it's never thai stick and i always said if i felt that way about a job i'd walk and i did and i didn't because of fuckin' money
what's done is done i need you cool are you cool?
i'm cool
want a smoke?
okay let's go through what happened we're in the place everything's going fine then the alarm gets tripped i turn around and all these cops are outside you're right it was like bam i blink my eyes are they're there everybody starts going apeshit then mr blonde starts shootin' all the 
that's not correct
what's wrong with it?
pinkerton it's been eight months i see robberies i see hold ups but i do not see men on the end of nooses
the cops didn't show up after the alarm went off they didn't show till after mr blonde started shooting everyone
as soon as i heard the alarm i saw the cops
i'm telling ya it wasn't that soon they didn't let their presence be known until after mr blonde went off i'm not sayin' they weren't there i'm sayin' they were there but they didn't move in till mr blonde became a madman that's how i know we were set up you can see that can't you mr white?
look enough of this "mr white" shit 
don't tell me your name i don't want to know i sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine
you're right this is bad  how did you get out?
tagged a couple of cops did you kill anybody?
a few cops
no real people?
uhuh just cops
 but there is worse  he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
first of all: you shut up  now you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover every time the james gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area but there's just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in this gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs
could you believe mr blonde?
that was one of the most insane fucking things i've ever seen why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that?
i don't wanna kill anybody but if i gotta get out that door and you're standing in my way one way of the other you're gettin' outta my way
that's the way i look at it a choice between doin' ten years and takin' out some stupid motherfucker ain't no choice at all but i ain't no madman either what the fuck was joe thinkin'? you can't work with a guy like that that motherfucker's unstable what do you think? do you think he panicked or ya think he's just triggerhappy?
i think he's a sick fuckin' maniac we're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot up the place i came this fucking close   to taking his ass out myself everybody panics when things get tense everybody panics everybody i don't care what your name is you can't help it it's human nature but ya panic on the inside ya panic in your head ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic then you get a grip and deal with the situation what you don't do is shoot up the place and kill everybody
what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional a psychopath is not a professional you can't work with a psychopath 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next i mean jesus christ how old do you think that black girl was? twenty maybe twentyone?
did ya see what happened to anybody else?
me and mr orange jumped in the car and mr brown floored it after that i don't know what went down
at that point it became every man for himself as far as mr blonde or mr blue are concerned i ain't got the foggiest once i got out i never looked back
what do you think?
i can't believe this
what do i think? i think the cops caught them or killed 'em
not even a chance they punched through? you found a hole
yeah and that was a fucking miracle but if they did get away where the fuck are they?
you don't think it's possible one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a 
nope
how can you be so sure?
i got the diamonds
where?
i got 'em all right?
where? are they out in the car?
yes that's the way to win the locals back to our side
no they're not in the car no i don't have them on me ya wanna go with me and get 'em? yes we can go right now but first listen to what i'm telling you we were fuckin' set up somebody is in league with the cops we got a judas in our midst and i'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here
that was the plan we meet here
then where is everybody? i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house we ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to mr blonde or mr blue they could both be dead or arrested they could be sweatin' 'em down at the station house right now yeah they don't know the names but they can sing about this place i mean that could be happening right now as we speak the cops could be in their cars drivin' here this minute
i swear to god i'm fuckin' jinxed
what?
two jobs back it was a four man job we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
no shit?
thank god we discovered in time we hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing just walked away from it
so who's the rat this time? mr blue? mr blonde? joe? it's joe's show he set this whole thing up maybe he set it up to set it up
i don't buy it me and joe go back a long time i can tell ya straight up joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit
i demand action
oh you and joe go back a long time i known joe since i was a kid but me saying joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous i can say i definitely didn't do it cause i know what i did or didn't do but i can't definitely say that about anybody else 'cause i don't definitely know for all i know you're the rat
for all i know you're the rat
now you're using your head for all we know he's the rat
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that i saw him take so don't be calling him a rat
i gotta take a squirt where's the commode in this dungeon?
so is he dead or what?
he ain't dead
so what is it?
i think he's just passed out
he will be dead fer sure if we don't get him to a hospital
no you demand results they are not the same thing and if you want results you will let me do my job as i see fit unless of course  you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
we can't take him to a hospital
without medical attention this man won't live through the night that bullet in his belly is my fault now while that might not mean jack shit to you it means a helluva lot to me and i'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die
well first things first staying here's goofy we gotta book up
so what do you suggest we go to a hotel? we got a guy who's shot in the belly he can't walk he bleeds like a stuck pig and when he's awake he screams in pain
you gotta idea spit it out
assuming we can trust joe how we gonna get in touch with him? he's supposed to be here but he ain't which is making me nervous about being here even if joe is on the up and up he's probably not gonna be that happy with us joe planned a robbery but he's got a blood bath on his hands now dead cops dead robbers dead civilians jesus christ i tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight if i was him i'd try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible
before you got here mr orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital now i don't like turning him over to the cops but if we don't he's dead he begged me to do it i told him to hold off till joe got here
well joe ain't gettin' here we're on our own now i don't know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call 'em
i don't know anybody
well i guess we drop him off at the hospital since he don't know nothin' about us i say it's his decision
can't you tell me anything?
well he knows a little about me
you didn't tell him your name did ya?
why
i told him where i was from a few days ago it was just a casual conversation
and what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
we had just gotten away from the cops he just got shot it was my fuckin' fault he got shot he's a fuckin' bloody mess  he's screaming i swear to god i thought we was gonna die right then and there i'm tryin' to comfort him telling him not to worry he's gonna be okay i'm gonna take care of him and he asked me what my name was i mean the man was dyin' in my arms what the fuck was i supposed to tell him "sorry i can't give out that information it's against the rules i don't trust you enough"? maybe i shoulda but i couldn't
oh i don't doubt is was quite beautiful 
don't fuckin' patronize me
one question: do they have a sheet on you where you told him you're from?
of course
so he's won
well that's that then i mean i was worried about mug shot possibilities already but now he knows:  what you look like  what your first name is  where you're from and  what your specialty is they ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out that's it right you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
we ain't taking him to a hospital
if we don't he'll die
and i'm very sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some ain't
you wanna shoot me you little piece of shit? take a shot
he got it in the belly he's still alive but won't be for long
is that supposed to be funny?
we don't think this place is safe
both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down
so you wanna git bit huh?
every three months the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty missouri they always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends
cut the bullshit we ain't on a fuckin' playground  i don't believe this shit both of you got ten years on me and i'm the only one actin like a professional you guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers you ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? they're just like you two always fightin' always sayin' they're gonna kill one another
you said yourself you thought about takin' him out
then that time has passed right now mr blonde is the only one i completely trust he's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops
you takin' his side?
i told ya he'd be pissed
he seems all right now but he went crazy in the store
hey i know what i'm talkin' about black women ain't the same as white women
okay mr expert if this is such a truism how come every nigger i know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
i'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out
not these guys
in english pinkerton
who cares what your name is? who cares if you're mr pink mr purple mr pussy mr piss
hello graham  joe  mr gardner
you should be maybe lednov heard about that sonora ranch of yours
maybe he did
we're going to look for him want to come along?
i've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed
and that's more important than finding lednov?
who shot who?
what's she doin' runnin' around the country at night
i wouldn't know did you ask her?
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
all i can get out of her is she don't care about livin'
look of things she doesn't
you don't know how good it is to see you
tell them to come on in
but i'm going to have to leave 'em here they're  well they're not the sort of people you're used to
it doesn't matter who they are
and one of 'em is sick
anybody hurt?
what's the matter with her?
this must have been in the family a long time
then what do you suggest don sanchez?
can you put men at all four?
and this is helen carter
yes ma'am
as far as  sonora?
they won't be riding in the wagon
did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass? it's quite a job
you can't leave us here
what good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
you can stay here if you like
we have to get to sonora there are jobs waiting for us there we'll pay you for your trouble
our kind of women?
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
what's the matter with her?
and this is helen carter
so am i
thanks and isn't there something we can do about supper  or making the beds?
steve and me we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp
but you eat don't you?
mostly we open a can of beans and boil some coffee
where do you keep the can opener?
of course it'll work you can get another girl to fill out the act
if you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
what is that?
steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire
would you mr phillips?
there's a nice boy
yeah
like what?
get back to the horses they're straggling
he's learning his letters
learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street
are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
they're stragglin'
what the hell is that sound?
but the nearest shelter's the wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away
can we get a doctor at that ranch?
so that was why she tried to run away
didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
i didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded i couldn't leave her in the street let's go
hold on
we can't stay here
coffee?
no thanks  i hope we won't be a burden to them
i'm sorry but that's how it's got to be
listen what are you doing tonight?
i suppose it is
you don't have to explain did i tell you how grateful i am for what you've done?
i couldn't leave you sitting by the road
i hope you get everything you want out of life 
thanks
you've earned it  the horse ranch on the toulomoe  the girl in the spotted gingham
the who?
ever since you've looked after steve you've had the dream  a ranch on the river  good grass good water barn corral and house  that part you've shared with steve the girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking 
go on tell me more about her
she wears this gingham dress  cooks popovers  makes jam in season  makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples
what? oh i'mbusy
i'll make the soap myself
but the rest is right
will she be dark or fair?
he knows his alphabet
are we leaving?
better go on back and get some more sleep you'll need it later on
you're not going out to look for them?
don't you trust me?
why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
why do you think?
listen you're dating luis he's in arizona you're fucking me and we haven't made plans what could you possibly be up to tonight?
i don't know i thought i did now i'm not sure i thought it had something to do with me
you know so much about me  figure it out
you wouldn't do a thing like that would you?
you should have i don't like leaving things unfinished
maybe it's better that way
tell me darling
what?
what did you expect? speeches i don't mean?
i'm awake now go on say what you want to say i'll listen
if it's pretty speeches you want you won't be hearing them even when i mean 'em they don't come easy
stop it i'm
save 'em for the girl in gingham just tell me i'm not good enough for you go on say a woman like me can't change
all right  it's said
no i'm not all right i'm soaked and i hit myself against that rock
all my clothes 
go on take it then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid
so grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance
if you want to go on i can make it all right
i won't have you fighting over me
maybe it isn't going to sonora but it's going somewhere which is all right with me
it's going to sonora
on a lot of lithium?
some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did i don't blame you because i understand your way of thinking and why you think that way you want your women on pedestals but they have to be born on 'em  they can fall off but they can't climb back up
i can't change either not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand
i'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will somebody who wants me as i am will maybe walk into the place where i'm working and take me out of there
goodbye thanks for the lift
goodbye mary
thanks for taking over
thanks for loading me on the stage i know now why you did it
where you going?
that job you were talkin' about did you get it yet?
why?
waiting for luis to call me he said he'd call tonight oh don't be difficult patrick
because well you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there tonight i was sort of tied up with steve but tomorrow i figured on doing just that
drop yours i'm gunshy
then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp
i found their surrey 
so did i they were in it
here's a man says he's looking for you girls
i  lost something
stretch out under the seat miss
which ranch?
i can't 
he must be replaced
you should come have dinner with me courtney butwhen?
you've got to  don't you understand  they want me with them and they'll fix it so i have to go 
how does she draw?
that's right
who's lednov?
you might tell a fellow things 'specially if the fellow's your brother seems to me
like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden
i don't want to run short
you never said this lednov's name before that i can remember
no call to that jail looked pretty solid to me  how's she feel?
but it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin' you shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
am i confused or were we talking about tonight?
what was he in jail for?
you sure worry that bone he killed a fellow
in a fight?
the other fellow wasn't even lookin'
you must be plenty worried about lednov sneakin' up on us  think he will?
yes
at the ranch maybe?
maybe at the ranch maybe sooner than that
do you have to be so closemouthed? i'm your brother and i'm ridin' with you remember?
that's lednov  we come along here
ummm   yeah luis is calling me tonight i need to be home for that
and meet him there
sure a lot of guys lookin' for lednov
yeah  and lednov's only lookin' for one man me
why?
he doesn't like me what you eatin'?
they sure must have been travelin' this keeps up we can start a store
i've got eleven horses
where'd they go?
there was only three of them at first i guess i lost my head
how'd you happen to miss?
pumpkin?
they were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin' i didn't have them to aim
a man can't help gettin' excited once in a while
that's right steve
can i have my gun back?
it's all right with me if she teaches you but i don't want you forgettin' your job
okeh i was wrong but you can't expect a fellow who never saw lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin' you've been sorta close mouthed about him
i guess i have you were pretty little when they locked him up i don't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months
sure i remember you went to mexico lookin' for cattle
you remember jeff rawson?  we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high
sure i do went off down to mexico or something
yes?
that's what i told you then only he didn't lednov killed him
oh that's the time you went away
i caught up with lednov in nogales he didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came i turned him over to the sheriff and  that's the story
maybe you shoulda killed him
maybe i should but i was never much on killin' anyway he moved too quick and i just got him through the shoulder  looks pretty peaceful up ahead
yeah it does
leaving them here when we could just as well take them we got plenty of room in the wagon and  and  they cook and drive the mules they don't bother anybody
finished son?
don't go arguing with your teacher
i'm not but there's some of it i don't see any sense to
pumpkin you're dating an asshole
want the wagon unloaded clay?
i didn't stop to think clay
all right i hurt your feelings but you know better than to go lightin' fires
come on we got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep
i'll eat when i'm good and ready
kind of feeling your oats this morning i haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while but that doesn't mean you're too old
go on hit me
sit down and eat till i say the word you're doing what you're told
you oughta say you're sorry  that's what you oughta do
you keep your nose out of my life young fella
uh huh
i said keep your nose out of my life no kid is going to tell me how to run it
you know what she asked me?
i don't care what she asked you
it is so your fault and and i guess maybe when we hit the ranch you andme better
half of them are mine
what did you come back for?
is that the only reason you came back?
sure what other reason would there be?
how's that?
kind of sore
pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in new york
you'll live
guess maybe i'm old enough to hold my own in a fight huh?
yeah  but don't make a habit of it
so  maybe i'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
i guess so  but don't make a habit of it
you can light the lamp  i'm sure glad it's you we were afraid those killers might come back
yeah how did you know?
i'm sorry about this mr wyatt i didn't know who she was
all right you didn't know
i can't take her with me
i know stop it
you're not bein' quite fair
i'm sorry about this mr wyatt i didn't know you had a daughter
all right you didn't know
i can't take her with me
you're not bein' quite fair
you can't stay here there's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker
i don't care
suppose that lednov was to have found you instead of me why you wouldn't have had a chance
i said i didn't care
runnin' off and worryin' people makin' it tougher on clay than it is already
pumpkin you're dating a tumbling tumbling dickweed
don't ask me because i won't tell you i won't tell anybody go away
don't act so  crazy
i'm sorry let's go
helen  why don't you and mary go on with clay?
he won't take us  don't you want us around?
of course i do  but it'd be better for you  and the house is kind of small 
if you're worried about mary and me talkin' too much don't no matter how many questions your old man asks we know how to keep our mouths shut
it isn't that 
don't talk  eat  we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here
but i want to stay
i know i should not tolerate his impertinence
patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore okay? i have to go
i'm not going anywhere i'm staying here where i belong
not if i know mary when she rides into sonora you'll be with her and mighty glad to be there after this i don't see how you stood it as long as you did
stop it  stop it
go away  please
she mustn't  don't you let her 
there there don't you upset yourself 
you got no business snoopin' around 
that something i shouldn't see?
what is it?
just a thing i was workin' on
courtney? dinner?
go on take your bath i'll beat it
that sure smells good
i like it
up here in the hills a man gets a hankering to smell powder
you're sure there's more where this came from?
i figure we'll get along just fine
i saw your fire and dropped by to say hello
what's the matter  restless?
yes people make me restless
even women?
i can't
there aren't any women here
i suppose that's your wagon in the river
some people who went by this way lost it  two men and some women they packed their stuff on horses and went on
and you're all alone
suppose i take a look
when i ask questions i like to hear answers
until you came along we were going to sonora
what do you know about that did you sell your place?
not exactly they decided gambling and dancing were bad for people  can i make it?
there you are now take it easy and you'll be all right
i'm thinking dorsia
aspen doesn't want us mr graham they threw us out
they shouldn't have done that
we tried to point that out but there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason they said aspen had outgrown us it's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon
goodbye and thanks
maybe you're going about this all wrong why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him that usually works  yeah but suppose he took us up on it where would we be?
you think that's all we busted  you should see
with a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other
it isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of
that's not what's worryin' me why didn't she tell us? maybe we could have done somethin'  gone somewhere else  puttin' a poor sick kid through this 
i tried my best but these things take time
dorsia's nice
and we're running out of that
how long do you think we'll have to stay here?
until pa gets around to driving us to minden
we don't want to go there
no we don't but that's where we're going from minden we take a stage to reno then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville then it's a day's trip to sonora
clay could save us an awful lot of time
he certainly could about a month
you're not giving up?
maybe i better start working on him
go on have another try at him
nice?
what's the use
we might as well start a fire
give it back to him we're leavin'
 gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing what do you think of that?
i'm sure of this but not of you  you won't open any joint i've been watching you change you're mad now and you think you can change back but you can't you'll end up making beds in a boarding house
mary honey i talked too much like always  he thinks you told elaine the things i told her
how do you know who we are?
everybody knows 
you said somebody was comin' back  who's comin' back?
clay phillips
you like it there don't you?
where is he?
how far up the trail?
we got to get movin'
what for?
because there's a man i want to see
i said let's go
one night more won't matter your friend'll be there anyway i don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch he knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it
we got company female company
why yes they're all i need
he dropped a shoe you shouldn't be ridin' him
the question is do you like it courtney? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight
put on another one
that won't help the stone bruise you ain't been around horses much looks like
what are you doin' 
pleased to meet you ma'am  we found your trunk were you doin' the driven'?
is that your kind of reading steve?
your brother's always looked after you hasn't he?
since i can remember ma'am
it wasn't clay's fault we've been moving around most all the time  mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place i can learn my letters then 
would you like to learn them?
i sure would
okay yeah what time?
maybe i could start you out
you're so nice
did someone say i wasn't nice?
good night miss wells
gee i can't
why not? you went farther than that last time
i'm too old for it miss wells that's for little kids
don't be silly nobody's too old to learn
aren't we stayin'?
what comes after z?
eight?
that's the end of the line
then i know my alphabet
and that's tough isn't it?
 and even if i do learn to read what use'll it be? i'm goin' to live on a ranch
unicorn what in heck's that?
unicorn  a kind of animal 
what do they look like?
hmmm sort of like a horse  with a horn in the center of its forehead
horses with horns huh do we have 'em in nevada?
no
then why?
pick me up?
how about california?
would they be good to eat?
kind of tough i guess but you're not liable to hunt them  i don't think there's any alive now anyways  and i'm not sure but i don't think there ever were
an' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
you don't read to fill your stomach poetry for instance all the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal  but they make you feel good
well steve?
nobody's gonna catch him sleeping don't worry about him
sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points you can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out
and you've got me all figured out?
like when you were standin' there looking after clay i knew right off what you were thinking because i've been watching you
a facial at elizabeth arden which was really relaxing then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish 
you were supposed to be reading words
don't pay any attention to him that's his way and i've found he's sure easy to get along with i don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and i guess i had it comin'
but you're his brother
she was only teasin'
oh sure
for the last ten miles i've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up i'm getting to the point where i don't think there's any place named sonora
you stretch out i'll fix something to eat
you don't know what it is to be sorry
goodnight
goodnight miss wells
is that donald trump's car?
are you okay?
yeah i'm fine i just broke up with my boyfriend that's all
that's always tough how long were you together?
well we never made it official so i guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend but i was seeing him in school i saw him at the mall about six months ago and i was too nervous to introduce myself so i followed him to his car and jotted down the license plate number it was registered to his mother so i went to her house she was so nice i mean she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz i never really spoke to her i just waited til she went to work then i climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book i say borrowed because i'm going to give it back one day but anyway i called everyone in it til i found her son he wasn't home when i called so i left this message how much in love i was with him i was and how i wanted to have his children just really opening up and he never called back i'd call and call and anyway six months and two restraining orders later i just decided i deserved better what about you? do you have a boyfriend?
brenda was right there's more to the story than the professor told us i found a secret room it had all these news clippings about hugh kane he was a very evil man

that we should take our friendship a little further?
yes
oh buddy i was thinking the same thing it might be our last night in this house and i think we should take full advantage of it

are you?
hey y'all what's going on?
shorty you're alive but what about your head?
professor is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
professor what's the history of this house?
alright cindy what's so important?
yippie wasn't that amazing?
it's some kind of energy field we better record this
oh christ this really isn't worth it and see courtney it's there for what? huh? tell us  why is it pulled down half an inch? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate
i got it
i'm telling you it was possessed
no i'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals and it is likely it did attack but it doesn't mean it was possessed maybe the two of you should sleep together
what are you getting at professor?
good idea and don't forget to give her a goodnight kiss
got a problem with that?
i take it you're not mad at me
i don't like this this
i think she's starting to suspect something?
oh my god it happened right here she came home she saw them
see? happy? you dumb bitch? are you happy you dumb bitch?
saw who?
i finished all the interviews
let me see the files
let me help you
here you go professor
yes the scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for
i also took the liberty of putting those with neardeath experiences on top
good thinking dwight traumatized coeds are a sure thing
as i am sure you are aware professor subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation which is of course why i've given them special consideration
look whatever you say kid but the more they're hurtin' the more they need a squirtin' if you know what i mean  ooh i like her
will you call me before thanksgiving?
cindy campbell classic abandoned personality disorder she seems guarded but willing to do this
willing? i like that  and this one?
that's ray williams i couldn't quite figure him out but he seemed very eager and excited when we met
car accident gun shot multiple stabbings a hook through the back where did you find these kids?
they are the survivors of the steveston county massacre
fantastic these kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken hell house
how are we going to get them all up there?
i'll make it part of the class we'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders
and what happens when all hell breaks loose?
we record and document it we're gonna make history dwight the first documented unrefuted evidence of life after death the book sales alone will be worth millions i'll be rich and you my friend will have one hell of a thesis paper now what time is orientation?
what are you doing tonight?
in about fifteen minutes
i have taken care of everything including medical supplies and blood storage we want to be safe
right what about condoms?
professor
hey you're the one who brought up safety i'm perfectly willing to go in raw
would you please focus?
fine  what's all this stuff?
are those cameras all throughout the house?
yes i thought that it would be best
so if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do i press to get a close up?
dinner at the river cafe au bar afterwards maybe
that one
i'm going to change for dinner i'll see you shortly
not to worry there's been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years
let's not forget folks this is a study on sleep disorders
my god is she dead?
professor i think you should see this
what is it? some tits? a beaver shot? what?
the image there
are you sure it's not the tape?
i don't think so it's on all the cameras and check this out the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded
that's nice
what the hell?
professor we need to talk
what is it dwight?
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short
what?
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated in one night i recorded cold spots shifting magnetic fields the eup is picking up white sounds everywhere
that's why we came here remember?
yes but i've seen the tapes this poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent we all could be in danger i say we pull the plug
i can do it myself
yeah i can see that later i want you to teach me that trick but right now we have a job to do
you andluis?
hello dwight

let's get out of here
it's only a little way mr august
i'd like to get out of here
we can't stand here all night
the acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret you understand that don't you?
yes i understand
then you also understand that you must die
when i wanted to
well you hate that job anyway why don't you just quit? you don't have to work
may i have some water? i'm thirsty
drink
no
mr ward will see you in just a few minutes won't you wait dr judd?
are you dr louis judd?
yes
i read your book the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking
you're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
i've come from jacqueline she needs money
i thought you told me you didn't know where she was
where are we going?
pat this is my cousin vanden and her boyfriend stash he's an artist
 i didn't she came to me a few days ago to put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me she thought you might lighten that burden
if jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself
i'm afraid she can't do that ward it would endanger her
you're a curious man you're willing to jeopardize jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity
well then i can tell you that in addition to other dangers there is a grave danger of jacqueline losing her sanity i would advise against you seeing her
how much does she want?
she could use a hundred dollars
i'll give you a check
i haven't got that much in cash
how much have you got?
why don t you just go for price?
about fortyfive dollars
tell me how is jacqueline?
but tell me 
she's nervous naturally under the circumstances
why mary 
hello frances
how's miss jacqueline?
i don't know that's why i came to see mrs redi i'm trying to find her
i know for the first time i'm beginning to be frightened i almost feel as if i'd never known my sister
nothing's happened to her it's just that i can't understand her not getting in touch with you
oh god patrick why price? price?
"the dante?"
it's on peary street just ask the people who run it they'll remember her  people who see miss jacqueline never forget her
i can't see much fun in teaching school why don't you go into the beauty business
but i like teaching school
well if it's fun for you it's all right i get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby
is mrs redi nice to work for?
redi's all right
she seems rather an odd woman to me
she's a pretty good sort
it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy
he's rich
the tip is anyhow i like to work on your hair
do you know what this is frances?
i ought to know
what did she want?
i did her hair
what were you talking about?
nothing
nothing that's absurd i heard you laughing and talking she was asking questions
she was just asking about you  whether it was nice to work for you or not
and that was all?
everybody's rich
no she asked about the trademark
what did she want to know?
she showed me a drawing
some of us frances must believe without understanding
we're not exactly strangers mary jacqueline spoke about you often i suppose she told you about me
noat the morgue they told me a mr gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline
the morgue? no wonder you fainted  i wish you had come to me first
then you know where jacqueline is?
but i'd give a great deal to know
why?
he's goodlooking
thank you it was a lovely dinner
good
you can't make it your life's work looking for jacqueline  ) you'll have to do other things liveget some enjoyment out of life i hope you'll let me help you
thank you goodnight
but you do believe me?
i'm sorry i didn't intend to treat you like a child
but you have treated me that way
however i won't say that i'll not take charge occasionally and i'm going to take charge new i've a job for you
a job?
you told me you were pretty good with youngsters today i bumped into an old friend of mine mrs wheeler  she runs a settlement house down in the village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher
everybody's goodlooking patrick
i'd like that
it's not much money but it's enough to live on you'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room
maybe the romaris might have a room they seem nice
the people at the restaurant?
 what have you done about irving august?
oh i'm making investigations
you've never believed a word i told you about mr august
look mary now that i know you better i think i can be more frank with you i don't believe you i still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale it's like some of jacqueline's stories
greg it isn't a wild tale it's true if there were only some way 
last night in this very restaurant mr jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear
he has a great body
you could have told me any time you were jacqueline's husband
things changed mary the reasons for finding jacqueline changed i want to find jacqueline to settle things
she's got to be found that's the first step she's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police
don't we know what happened don't go on
any court in the land would understand we'll wait a few days  let you rest  then we'll go to the police
i thought i might close up the apartment  maybe get a place in connecticut
good night jacqueline  good night mary
yes
i'm going to find your sister
i don't think that's a good subject for jokes mr hoag
are you using minoxidil?
but i'm not joking
don't be ridiculous for months i've had the best private detective in new york looking for miss gibson
but i'm better than a detective i have an understanding of people  and a love of them  an understanding of the city  
you don't even know jacqueline gibson
but i understand her that may be more important
mary when you first came here i told you to look into your heart you didn't listen to me you listened to the policeman instead you didn't find your sister did you?
well?
all very nice but what are you going to do  listen at every house in new york for jacqueline's voice?
i'm looking for a party  a merry party
do you think he knows about this?
no i'm not why should i ?
could you find him?
what's that?
let her know what?
she'll have to know some time
who are you?
i'm mimi  i'm dying
and you don't want to die i've always wanted to die  always
why wait?
i'm not going to wait i'm going out  laugh dance do all the things i used to do
and then?
i'm coming with you
your hairline looks like it's receding
i don't know
please jacqueline
goodbye darling i'll only be gone until three
goodbye
if you get lonely go down and see mrs romari i told her you were staying with me
you'll be all right?
were you going to make a suggestion?
wellthen i have spoiled your dinner  "your food won't digest and your wine will sour"
at least you knew about dr judd
yes
i want a firm commitment
and you knew he'd be here
yes and now that i've shown you that i know that much and can guess more  will you trust me to look for jacqueline?
it's terribly sweet of you jason
i have been at the library
but you're always at the library
i went as a detective i found out that mrs redi reads the same books as dr judd
i don't think that's so revealing
but who is judd a psychiatrist it's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies but why should mrs redi a woman with a beauty parlor ?
i don't know
that's it and this figure she traced it the book i saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in march mrs redi had it out in april no one else had read it since
why? what's wrong?
i'm at sea jason
such a simple matter this figure is the symbol of the palladists
it's all clear to me now  so clear
i thought it would be but just to be sure i'll tell you that the palladists are a society of devil worshippers 
look i'm serious it's a real and vary earnest society  a dangerous society
i can imagine
i want you to see my room i want you to see all of it
my window   through which i see the world
it isn't that  you said "have to go" what could compel you 
don't make me tell you jason
we need to talk
you went to see mrs redi she told you something  what was it?
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man
and gregory  he loves her
he loves you mary and you'll have to tell him
i can't find gregory i've been trying to find him
what's wrong mary?
jacqueline mr romari phoned me she went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before
i hate people who try to peddle comfort butmary you shouldn't mourn for jacqueline life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind it's better this way
ah my jason  always laughing  always trying to help others  he's a good boy miss  he just talks that way
what are you thinking of bella? can i eat dry?
talk about what patrick? what is there to talk about?
oh mr jason i really shouldn't be doing this you know it's against the rules  when did you say you wanted them?
i want to see what they read so i'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents there's nothing nicer for a gift than a book
and the other was judd?
yes dr louis judd
would it be asking too much miss gottschalk for you to get me these books?
why mr jason most of these books are on the closed shelf you have to get permission
where is jacqueline gibson?
what a peculiar question
i saw you with her last week i knew you'd be here tonight where is she?
see that girl? that's jacqueline's sister it's because of her i ask
it's over evelyn it's all over
what was she to you?
i don't think that you would understand if i told you
i think i understand without your telling me i know something of your history jason i know that you haven't written for ten years
it goes beyond that it praises the goodness of god and the greatness of all his works
i hope it finds as much favor as your other book  but somehow i doubt it  the time is out of tune
you don't expect me to do that do you?
yes when i tell you
perhaps
i'm afraid this is no time to play cyrano my friend what was in your mind?
i suppose jason that you'll speak for your friend    and your poetry will speak for you
touchy touchy i'm sorry i brought the wedding up let's just avoid the issue alright? now are we having coffee?
i don't suppose you'll ever tell her will you?
she is very young  i have an old habit of failure it would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage
a book of successful verse might have changed that eh?
if you like i'll go with you to dinner
dr judd?
don't be so amazed it's a very ordinary matter i'm jacqueline's physician mr ward told me you were in town and jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her
you know where she is?
it's my cloven hoof it trips me up sometimes
cloven hoof?
yes you could become a country wife  fool around with petunias and pullets
i'm fucking serious it's fucking over us this is no joke i don't think we should see each other anymore
would they hurt her?
because you are intelligent  that's why they sent me to you 
i think i can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation i know too much i was jacqueline's psychoanalyst
perhaps natalie this is a bargain you're offering me i am being allowed to join  to buy safety by betraying jacqueline  is that it?
i haven't said anything of the sort
but you would like to know where she is?
yes there are certain punitive measures
i'm afraid you have mistaken my motive louis i thought you might understand and sympathize
i have no sympathy for either good or evil i have only curiosity  a professional curiosity what unhappy people most of you are
i was a great dancer
but your friends are my friends my friends are your friends i don't think it would work  you have a little something on your upper lip
a strange collection you're like the false god you worship fallen angels all of you
life has betrayed us we've found there is no heaven on earth so we must worship evil for evil's own sake we're not wicked we commit no violence unless
unless what?
no you draw no secrets from me as you drew them from jacqueline you are not one of us yet you're clever louis but i recognize your interest in me for what it is worth you are only curious you have never loved a woman who had but one arm
it would be a charming experience she might only protest half as much
is it about jacqueline?
i don't know how to begin this natalie perhaps it's best to just plunge in i want to join you
we always knew you'd come to us louis
but i'm not coming to you out of deep conviction i'm coming to you out of loss i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good
i never thought you did
you're really serious aren't you?
i've talked nonsense i've scoffed and hooted  but somewhere very deep down in me i always felt that good held the balance of power
this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke
i'm very very serious
but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister
mary i'm amazed didn't jacqueline tell you? she sold the business to me at least eight months ago it's my business now
there's nothing you can think of  old letters anything that might give me some hint as to where i might find jacqueline?
leave me your address and if i find anything i'll get in touch with you
i'm stopping at the chatsworth
i'm afraid not
yes
yes  yes come with me
yes i am
this is mrs redi mary
i'll be out in a minute
if i were you mary  i'd go back to school i'd make no further attempt to find jacqueline
why?
i can almost feel your doubt about what i'm saying mary
i can't give up looking for her mrs redi no matter what you're hinting at
i have no intention whatsoever of hinting your sister mary is a murderess she killed irving august  stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding
i don't believe it
she's not been here for a long time
but she was here?
but what about the past? our past?
you mean she just came here rented the room locked it and left?
yes  and pays the rent every month
your sister   have you heard from her lately?
no mrs lowood she doesn't write often
difficult? has anything happened to jacqueline?
we don't know mary we've been unable to get in touch with your sister
sometimes she can be quite careless why don't you try mrs redi?
i have written repeatedly to mrs redi she vouchsafes no information whatsoever  it is six months since your tuition has been paid mary naturally it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil
but mrs lowood i can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister maybe if i went to new york  if i saw mrs redi myself 
i'm worry to bother you i want to ask you about my sister
we never really shared one
yes?
i thought you might know her she was seen here about a week ago her name is jacqueline gibson
i don't know no gibson this is a restaurant many people come here
no  the rent in paid the lady asked us to promise i wouldn't open the door
fo come ti pare to desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza
miss gibson i'm tired of resting
is it fifteen minutes yet?
children i want you to be very good and very quiet while i see mrs wheeler a moment she's going to take over this class for a while
why
because i have something very important to do
you're inhuman
what?
i'll be right back with mrs wheeler
i went back through the history last night i read about johann rozenquartz  i read what he wrote 
i can quote it fully mrs redi "we will avoid violence for once undertaken violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil"
but he also wrote 
but she told him frances she told him about us
it is a very real danger and one which forces our decision
i have taken care of mary i've spoken to her she's going back to school
i'm sorry to be late natalie
jacqueline you have spoken so often of ending it all i can't understand why this should be so difficult for you you have only to drink a little
no no no
you have only to stretch out your hand take up the glass and drink a little
ann?
yes?
that was quick
false alarm
we don't usually let people smoke in the house we have a patio if you 
do you have other things?
yes  oh you mean to bring in no yes i have some other things no i don't need to bring them in this is all i need to stay here
have you ever been on television?
television?
if you really want to do something for me you can stop making this scene right now
yes
no why?
graham is an unusual name
yeah i guess it is my mother is a complete anglophile anything british makes her drool like a baby she probably heard the name in some movie she's a prisoner of public television now
oh uhhuh
are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
no i think you look fine
oh well maybe i'm uncomfortable with my appearance i feel a little out of place in these surroundings
well
i used to take great pleasure in that being purposefully different rubbing people's noses in it didn't you do that when you were younger?
oh god i can't believe this
no not really
oh well i did i was in a band once and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible
you play an instrument?
no i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone the whole thing was really irrelevant how do you like being married?
oh i like it i like it very much
freelance you know
yes so you feel security stability like things are going to last awhile
oh definitely i mean just this past year has gone by like phew i hardly even knew it passed
oh uhhuh
anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
where are you going?
you mean like "time flies"?
exactly i would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things or could mean lots of things
how long has it been since you've seen john?
nine years
nine years?
yes i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place
why? didn't you know him well?
why'd you drop out?
oh lots of reasons most of them boring but up until i dropped out john and i were very much alike
that's hard to believe the two of you seem so different
i'm just leaving
this food is excellent
mother father sister
sister older or younger?
i don't know
do i pay taxes? of course i pay taxes only a liar doesn't pay taxes i'm not a liar a liar is the second lowest form of human being
what's the first?
would you mind?
no
maybe you'll understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes
yeah i know i mean i'm not saying i know people think you're a bitch i'm saying i know what you mean and i don't even know that people think you're a bitch do they?
but where?
i feel like they do
i know that i just don't feel a connection with very many people so i don't waste time with people i don't feel one with
can i tell you something personal? i feel like i can it's something i couldn't tell john or wouldn't anyway
it's up to you but i warn you if you tell me something personal i might do the same
do you understand what i'm trying to say?
i think so i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love
so what about kids?
kids? what about them?
do you want them?
yeah actually i do but john doesn't at least not right now
i brought you some letters  it's really fan mail  women mostly  one wants to buy you clothes another sent a check another wants a check
you'll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion but there are subtle differences between us mcdermott is the biggest asshole van patten is the yes man price is the most wired i'm the best looking we all have light tans right now i'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table and van patten keeps asking dumb obvious questions about how to dress 
why is that?
so what's your personal thing? are you really going to tell me something personal?
do you want me to?
as long as it's not gross you know? like some scar or something it has to be like mine like something about you
you're what?
impotent
you are?
does it bother you?
not usually i mean honestly i haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection so i feel i'm way ahead of the game as far as being clearheaded goes
well are you selfconscious about it?
picked them up from the printers yesterday
i am selfconscious but not in the same way that you are you have got to be the most attractive self conscious person i've ever seen
why do you say i'm selfconscious?
well i've been watching you i've watched you eat i've watched you speak i've watched the way you move and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time and you know what?
what?
they are looking at you ann you are truly breathtaking i don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people men want to possess you women wish they looked like you and those that don't or can't resent you and the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse
my therapist said that 
you're in therapy?
aren't you?
hah no i'm not actually i used to be but the therapist i had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems of course i lied to him constantly so i guess i can't hold him totally responsible
so you don't believe in therapy?
good coloring
i believe in it for some people i mean for me it was silly i was confused going in so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately
well my therapist knows me intimately
you had sex with you therapist?
of course not
oh see i meant someone you've had sex with that's part of the theory
excuse me for asking but how would you know?
now you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately right?
so since i've never had sex with you by your own advice i shouldn't accept your advice
hi
ann hello
eggshell with romalian type  what do you think?
are you in the middle of something?
nothing i can't finish later
i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished
not much to see i'm afraid i'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe
what are these?
videotapes
it's a personal project i'm working on
what kind of personal project?
oh just a personal project like anyone else's personal project mine's just a little more personal
who's donna?
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody what do you think bateman?
donna?
donna on this tape it says "donna"
donna was a girl i knew in florida
you went out with her?
because i enjoy interviewing women more than men
all of these are interviews?
yes
can we look at one?
no
why not?
because he dated her
what what are these interviews about?
the interviews are about sex ann
about sex?
yes
what about sex?
everything about sex
like what?
like what they've done what they do what they don't do what they want to do but are afraid to ask for what they won't do even if asked anything i can think of
you just ask them questions?
yes
how did you guess?
and they just answer them?
mostly sometimes they do things
to you?
no not to me for me for the camera
i don't why why do you do this?
i'm sorry this came up
this is just so
maybe you want to go
i'm not sure why i came here i had kind of decided not to talk to you after you know
john and cynthia have been "fucking"
girls dig bateman he's cq you're total cq bateman
i know
you know?
yes
how did you know?
she said it on her tape
why didn't you tell me?
but even if we had been speaking i wouldn't have told you
why not?
do you think that's such a good idea?
don't you want to make one?
do you know what ed gein said about women?
yes but i sense the element of revenge here
what difference does it make why i do it?
i want you to be aware of what you're doing and why because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind
what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
that's a good question
what do you have to do to get ready?
load a new tape turn the camera on
how do you pay for all this? i mean rent and tapes and this equipment
i have money
what will you do when the money runs out?
ed gein? maitre d' at canal bar?
it won't are you ready?
tell me your name
tell me your name
ann bishop millaney
do you talk to him?
when we're making love?
yes
sometimes afterward
you don't know what i'm thinking
is he going to see this?
you bring the cigarettes?
listen what about dinner?
did you have sex before you were married?
yes
i don't see what difference it makes i mean i can think what i want  i don't know if i want to do this anymore i'm afraid i don't mind answering the questions so much but if somebody were to see this
yes i have i will
then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about
i guess not
no
yes whenever all right look whenever i see a man that i think is attractive i wonder what it would be like with him i mean i'm just curious i don't act on it but i hate that i think that i wish i could just forget about that stuff
why?
because that's how cynthia thinks all she does is think about that stuff and i hate that i don't want to be like her i don't want to be like her
are you my two o'clock?
you're not like your sister you couldn't be like her if you wanted to
so you do fantasize?
yes
about who?
i fantasized about you
about me?
have you fantasized about me?
i thought i made that clear before when i said i would go down on you
i remember you could do that couldn't you? go down on me?
yes
can i help you?
if i asked you to would you? not on tape i mean?
no
on tape?
no
why not?
if i can't do it all i don't want to do anything and i can't do it all
can't
you said you weren't always impotent
that's correct
so you have had sex
doesn't he live here?
yes
who was the last person you had sex with?
her name was elizabeth
so what happened? was it so bad that it turned you off?
no it was wonderful that wasn't the problem
what was the problem?
the problem was me i was i was a pathological liar or am i should say lying is like alcoholism one is always "recovering"
so you lied to her?
yes i did willfully and repeatedly
how come?
no he doesn't
i loved her for how good she made me feel and i hated her for how good she made me feel and at that time i tended to express my feelings non verbally i couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions
and now you can?
now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me
don't you get lonely?
how could i with all these nice people stopping by? the fact is that i've lived by myself for so long i can't imagine living with another person it's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by and anyway i'm asking the questions are you happy?
i don't know anymore i thought i was but obviously i was wrong
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him?
not yet i'm not sure i will i just want out
if you do get out of your marriage will you continue to be inhibited?
i don't know it all gets back to that cynthia thing i don't like her eagerness there's nothing left to imagine there's no
are you sure?
subtlety?
subtlety yes no subtlety plus i've never really felt able to open up with anyone i mean that other person i told you about i enjoyed making love with him a lot but i still wasn't able to really let go i always feel like i'm being watched and i shouldn't embarrass myself
and you feel the same way with john?
kind of i mean john's like this kind of craftsman like he's a carpenter and he makes really good tables but that's all he can make and i don't need anymore tables
interesting analogy
i'm babbling
no you're not
god i m so mad at him
you should be he lied to you so did cynthia
you're really never going to make love again?
you saw the ad in the times?
if you were in love with me would you?
i'm not in love with you
but if you were?
i i can't answer that precisely
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you
that's very flattering
so why won't you make love with me? why wouldn't you i mean?
ann are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now?
i can't
why not?
no yes i mean yes i did in the times but doesn't paul owen still live here?
i've told you
but i don't understand 
ann it could happen to me all over again don't you see? i could start to 
but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig 
who? elizabeth?
yes
you mean you're still in contact with her?
no
but you're planning to be?
i don't know possibly
i think you should go now
wait a minute wait a minute what's going on here? did you come back here just to see her again?
not entirely
but that was part of it?
yes
like maybe a big part?
possibly
graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
i don't know
look at you look at what's happened to you look how you've changed don't you think she will have changed?
i don't know i really would rather not talk about it
but i thinki want to know what happened here
whoa i'm so glad we got that on tape you won't answer a question about elizabeth but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life graham what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? are you going to tell her about them? i can't imagine her being too understanding about that but since you don't lie anymore you'll have to say something
as i said i haven't decided what to do exactly perhaps i won't do anything
all right you want to talk about lies let's talk about lies ann let's talk about lying to yourself you haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him and maybe you never were you haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember
don't do that
why not?
because
"because"? that's not good enough i asked you a question graham i asked you "how does it feel"? how does it feel mr i want to go down on you but i can't? do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? including me? come on how does it feel?
i can't tell you like this
i'm just going to keep asking until you answer i'm sure there's plenty of tape
i don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting 
delusions and paranoia
don't come back
come on
why are you ashamed?
jesus christ ann why is anybody anything? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad and you don't allow for any gray areas and that's what most of us consist of
you're not answering me
well what kind of answer are you looking for ann? what is it exactly that you want to know?
i want to know why you are the way you are
and i'm telling you it's not any one thing that i can point to and say "that's why" it doesn't work that way with people who have problems ann it's not that neat it's not that tidy it's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count things just don't happen that way
but why can't you just put it all behind you? can't you just forget it? all that stuff you did?
i want to touch you
graham
excuse me gentlemen right back he approaches carnes cautiously
that's the first thing that ran through my mind when i saw you i thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade
oh we get along okay she's just very she's an extrovert i think she's loud she probably wouldn't agree definitely wouldn't agree
graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district there are some nice little places there garage apartments and stuff
john?
mmmmm
tuesday i had a late lunch
yes i just got busy
then maybe i saw an old message there are a lot of them on my desk you know
who'd you have lunch with?
something wrong?
jesus davis yes that was hilarious that was you wasn't it?
are you having an affair?
jesus christ where'd that come from? i have a late lunch by myself and now i'm fucking somebody?
well are you?
no i'm not frankly i'm offended at the accusation
if i'm right i want to know i don't want you to lie i'd be very upset but not as upset as if i'd found out you'd been lying
there's nothing to know ann
i can't tell you how upset i would be if you were lying
ann you are completely paranoid not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks and you act like i'm dipped in shit you know i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on
my sister for one is that who it is?
for god's sake ann i am not fucking your sister i don't find her that attractive for one
yes naturally
is that supposed to comfort me?
i was just saying you know? i didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love i could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair
but i'm not
i'm not either
why don't i believe you?
look this conversation is utterly ridiculous maybe when you have some evidence we should talk but don't give me conjecture and intuition
always the lawyer
goddam right i mean can you imagine: "your honor i'm positive this man is guilty i can't place him at the scene or establish a motive but i have this really strong feeling"
you've made your point
i'm sorry too i i get these ideas in my head you know and i have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios and then i want to believe it so i don't think i've wasted the whole day last week i was convinced you were having an affair with cynthia i don't know why
it was a pretty long message wasn't it?
i don't either i mean cynthia of all people she's so
loud
yeah jeez give me some credit
i didn't say it was rational i just said i was convinced
isn't therapy helping at all?
i don't know sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world
quitting your therapy won't feed the children of ethiopia
jesus christ what the hell happened? i came home and your car was gone the door was open i thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker i was literally just calling the cops when you walked in what happened?
i want out of this marriage
what?
what exactly do you mean?
i want out of this marriage
why?
where did you go when you left here?
goddammit goddammit that son of a bitch  well at least i know you didn't fuck him
you're leaving me for him aren't you? well that makes a sad sort of sense he can't and you won't
answer me godammit did you make one of those tapes?
goddam right
bastard
you son of a bitch
i have thought about it yes
by the way davis how is cynthia? you're still seeing her right?
god damn you
yes i remember what do you do when these moods overtake you?
nothing i mean nothing i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
no i didn't
don't you think that's a lot of garbage? i'd really like to know where it's all going to go
do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening?
ann do you see a pattern here?
what do you mean?
well last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem
carnes? wait
yeah so?
if you think about it i think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over
are you afraid of his reaction? of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
no i don't know i haven't told him about the garbage thing because i'm pissed off at him right now he's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he didn't even ask me about it i mean i would've said yes i just wish he would've asked
what upsets you about that?
i guess i'm upset because i can't really justify being upset i mean it's his house really he pays the mortgage
but he asked you to quit your job and you do have housework
yeah i know
this unexpected visit notwithstanding how are things with john?
when did you begin having this feeling?
davis i'm not one to badmouth anyone your joke was amusing but come on man you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork such a boring spineless lightweight that i couldn't fully appreciate it i wasn't fooled for a second now if you'd said price or mcdermottotherwise it was amusing now let's have lunch or dinner or something hilarious davis a killer
about a week ago i don't know what brought it on i just started feeling like i didn't want him to touch me
prior to this feeling were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched
but see he stopped before i got that feeling that's why it seems weird to me i mean i'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile and i would except it never occurs to me i'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself
what do you mean?
did you masturbate?
god no
i take it you've never masturbated?
well i kind of tried once it just seemed stupid i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh i don't know and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage you know?
so it was recently that you tried this
what are you talking about? bateman is what?
well i don't know the week started off okay but then i was outside watering the plants and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect so i went inside and turned on the airconditioner full blast and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor and 
radon leakage?
yes it's this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and  you've never heard of this?
no i haven't
well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you  i knew i shouldn't have watered those plants
did you confront john about the visitor?
what visitor?
the friend of john's that was staying at your house
oh graham no i didn't talk to him about that actually that turned out to be pretty interesting i expected graham to be this well like john you know? i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff but he turned out to be this this kind of character i mean he's kind of arty but okay you know?
is he still at your house?
i was all of these
now if you'll excuse me i really must
no he left last week
did you find him attractive?
what do you mean like physically?
let me rephrase were you attracted to him?
what brought this on?
i've been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me
i thought that's what i did who was it that you talked to?
ann in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas  did it occur to you that graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy?
what do you mean? i don't understand
it's possible that graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with and he would like to see other people you for instance wallow in their situation just as he does do you think that's possible?
wait stop you don't seem to understand you're not really comprehending any of this i killed him i did it carnes i'm patrick bateman i chopped owen's fucking head off i tortured dozens of girls the whole message i left on your machine was true
i guess
you understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
yes
that you are under no obligation to me?
yes
do you want to leave therapy?
not really
do you feel there is more progress to be made?
yes
i'm glad you feel that way because i feel that way too
excuse me i really must he going
i hate my sister
why?
there are many things that can exert control over one's life good and bad religion greed philanthropy drugs
i don't know he went to school here then he was in new york for awhile then philadelphia and then just kind of travelling around
must be nice so what's he like is he like john?
is he? strange i mean?
not really maybe if i just saw him on the street i'd have said that but after talking to him he's just kind of i don't know unusual
uhhuh so what's he look like?
why?
i just want to know what he looks like is all
now carnes listen to me listen very very carefully i killed paul owen and i liked it i can't make myself any clearer
why so you can go after him?
besides even if i decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours?
do you have to say that?
what?
you know what you say it just to irritate me
i say it because it's descriptive
well he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway
ann you always underestimate me
well i wonder why
i think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together i think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me
but that's simply not possible and i don't find this funny anymore
oh for god's sake really cynthia really i don't think he's your type
"my type"? what is this bullshit? how would you know what "my type" is?
i have a pretty good idea
ann you don't have a clue look i don't even know why we're discussing this i'll just call him myself
he doesn't have a phone
well i'll call him when he does
but he won't
what are you talking about?
he's not getting a phone he doesn't like talking on the phone
oh please okay so give me the zen master's address i'll think of a reason to stop by
it never was supposed to he why isn't it possible?
let me talk to him first
why? just give me the address you won't even have to be involved
i don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
and what?
lose something?
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune
are you getting mom something for her birthday?
i don't know i'll get her a card or something
a card? for her fiftieth birthday?
what's wrong with that?
it's just not
don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? i mean the woman gave birth to you it's her fiftieth birthday 
will you stop? jesus
i just thought it might 
okay ann okay how about this: you buy her something nice and i'll pay for half all right?
fine
good now if you'll pardon me i have to go to work
i don't he doesn't want you to come over
what do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? did you tell him about me?
no i didn't
why not?
because i had dinner with paul owen twice in londonjust ten days ago
because i never got around to it
well why?
because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you don't want to get involved with him
what the hell happened over there? did he make a pass at you?
no
then what's the story what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? is he drowning puppies or what?
no it's nothing like that
well what? is he dangerous?
no he's not dangerous not physically
well what then?
no youdidn't?
i don't want to talk about it
then why'd you call me?
he just asked me questions
what kinds of questions?
questions about sex
well like i don't want to tell you exactly
oh so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you won't tell your own sister?
apparently
yes i did
cynthia
patrick thanks so much for looking after courtney dorsia how impressive how on earth did you get a reservation there?
what?
why did you do that?
because i wanted to
but why did you want to?
i wanted him to see me
cynthia who knows where that tape may end up? he could be bouncing it off some satellite or something some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it
he wouldn't do that
you don't know that for sure
well it's too late now isn't it?
did he touch you?
it means that gigglepuss is playing at club skunk and we're going
well you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently  no question about that
lucky i guess
no but i did
in front of him ann yes
you are in trouble
listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about?
i can't believe you did that
why?
i mean i couldn't do that in front of john even
you couldn't do it period
you know what i mean you don't even know him
i feel like i do
that's a wonderful jacket let me guess valentino couture?
that doesn't mean you do you can't possibly trust him he's perverted
he's harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes what's the big deal?
so he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? that doesn't make you feel weird?
no i don't think they all did what i did
you are in serious trouble
ann i don't understand why this freaks you out so much you didn't do it i did and if it doesn't bother me why should it bother you?
i don't want to discuss it
here it is
what is it?
it's a sun dress
uh huh
it looks like a tablecloth
i was just trying to 
so what's my share of the dress?
thank you
do you have my work number?
i get real busy between two and four
bye
did he ask me to take my clothes off? no he didn't
no i touched me
i wish you'd get an answering machine
it looks so soft
there's a phone here
well why would she want a sun dress? she's got spots on her shoulders and varicose veins
who are you?
i'm cynthia bishop
do i know you?
i'm ann millaney's sister
the extrovert
she must have been in a good mood when she said that she usually calls me loud
she called you that too may i ask why you're here?
you want me to leave?
patrick? is that you?
i just want to know why you're here
well like i said ann is my sister sisters talk you can imagine the rest
no i really can't i find it healthy never to characterize people i don't know or conversations i haven't heard i don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else last time i saw ann she left here very confused i would say and upset
she still is
and are you here to berate me for making her that way?
nope
she didn't tell you why she was upset?
nope
she didn't give you my address?
nope
no luis it's not me you're mistaken
how did you find me?
i uh know a guy at the power company
i don't understand why did you want to come here? i mean i can't imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me
well i don't really listen to her when it comes to men i mean look at john for crissake oh you went to school with him didn't you? you're probably friends or something
nope i think the man is a liar
i think you're right so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened
oh okay i think i get it
what do you get?
well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
not exactly
this is gwendolyn ichiban this is my very good friend patrick bateman where are you going? we're going to nell's gwendolyn's father's buying it  where did you get your overnight bag?
well either you are or you aren't which is it?
why don't you let me tape you?
doing what?
talking
about what?
sex your sexual history your sexual preferences
what makes you think i'd discuss that with you?
nothing
you just want to ask me questions?
i just want to ask you questions
call me please patrick
and that's all?
that's all
is this how you get off or something? taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
yes
would anybody else see the tape?
absolutely not they are for my private use only
how do we start?
i turn on the camera you start talking
and you ask questions right?
yes
whatisit?
how long will it take?
that depends on you one woman only used three minutes another filled up three two hour tapes
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what 
no
do i sit or stand?
whichever you prefer
i'd rather sit are you ready?
i am now recording tell me your name
cynthia patrice bishop
describe for me your first sexual experience
where are you going?
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse?
your first sexual experience
i was eight years old michael green who was also eight asked if he could watch me take a pee i said he could if i could watch him take one too he said okay and then we went into the woods behind our house i got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying "ladies first" so i pulled down my underpants and urinated and he ran away before i even finished
was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
no he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away to cleveland actually
how unfortunate so when did you finally get to see a penis?
when i was fourteen
live or in a photograph or film of some sort?
very much live
what did you think? did it look like you expected?
what about oleg?
i've gottai've gottareturn some videotapes
not really i didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube
were you disappointed?
no if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting it had character you know?
what about when you touched it? what did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like?
it was warmer than i thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked it's weird thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me i mean after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me
what did he say?
he said that my hand felt good
then what happened?
would you like me to take my pants off?
if you wish  you're not wearing any underwear
patrick?
do you like the way i look?
yes
do you think i'm pretty?
yes
prettier than ann?
john doesn't have sex with ann anymore
is that what he tells you?
hello
look i'm just going to come right out and tell you why i'm here okay?
okay
van patten looks puffy has he stopped working out?
no
no? not even one more?
i never do more than one i'm sorry
i can't talk you into it?
no you'll have to get somebody else
now who the hell is going to do that for me?
i'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer
but i want you to do it i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody i can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything
ouch okay i deserved that cynthia don't you understand? after the first time it's just not spontaneous there's no edge anymore look at the tapes there is only one date on each label i have never taped anyone twice
so make an exception
that's paul owen
no
how about if you record over the one we already made? you could have the same date and not use another tape who would know?
i would
well what the hell am i supposed to do?
cynthia i don't know
i can't believe you're doing this after i let you tape me
i'm sorry i can't do it
goddamit give me my tape then
i've got to get back to the office
i can't let my lunch hour go on too long i've already skipped one meeting
there's this theory out now that if you can catch the aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected then you can also catch anythingalzheimer's muscular dystrophy hemophilia leukemia diabetes dyslexia for christ's sakeyou can get dyslexia from pussy
i have a friend coming in from out of town i'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days
meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile right?
i wish you'd quit that bartending job
why?
i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time
i can handle it besides the money is good and some of the guys are cute and you are in no position to be jealous
who said i was jealous?
i wish i could tell everybody that ann's a lousy lay beautiful popular ann bishop millaney
could be risky
well maybe i could just start a rumor then
i'm not sure guy but i don't think dyslexia is a virus
no i mean doing it at my house
afraid of getting caught?
maybe
you should be can i meet this friend of yours?
cynthia i don't think you want to i mean you should see the way he dresses i really think he's in a bad way
i'm intrigued
you're intrigued?
hello
cynthia john meet me at my house in exactly one hour
john?
jeez that's not a helluva lot is it?
hello
cynthia john
not today i've got other plans
oh  well when then?
how about inviting me over to dinner?
you know what i mean
john millaney
i want to see you
when?
right now
maybe it's just the light
jesus i don't know if i can get away i've got a client waiting i'd have to do some heavy duty juggling
hello
cynthia john
well this is timely your wife is here would you like to speak to her?
i don't know i'm not sure i can duplicate the level of intensity i had the other day
nothing wrong with trying
do you want me to stop calling?
it's just so blatantly stupid i have a hard time believing you did it
what's so stupid about it?
that you you don't even know the guy
is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  oh my god
well you know him he's a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted?
shit after what you've told me i don't know i should've known when he showed up dressed like some arty brat
i like the way he dresses
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
"the wrong hands"? we're not talking about military secrets john they're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off
jesus christ and he doesn't have sex with any of them? they just talk?
right
jesus i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people almost why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
doesn't work he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them
i felt like it so what? goddam you and ann make such a big deal out of it
what?
you told ann about this?
of course she is my sister i tell her almost everything
i wish you hadn't done that
why not?
it's just something i'd prefer she didn't know about
she's a grownup she can handle it
i just ann is very
hung up
it just wasn't a smart thing to do did you sign any sort of paper or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
no
disappeared  they're looking everywhere  maybe he went back to czechoslovakia
it's definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay
you realize you have no recourse legally? this stuff could show up anywhere
it won't i trust him
you trust him
yeah i do a helluva lot more than i trust you
what do you mean?
exactly what i said i'd trust him before i'd trust you how much clearer can i be?
it hurts that you would say that to me
oh please come on john you're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year you're a liar but at least i know you're a liar it's the people that don't know like ann that have to watch out
by definition you're lying to ann too
that's right but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister
shut up
look are we going to do it or not?
actually no i've changed my mind i shouldn't have called
well i'm here now i'd like to do something
come on john you should be happy we've gone this far without ann finding out i'm making it real easy on you just walk out of here and i'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime
did he put you up to this?
who?
graham
no he didn't put me up to this jesus i don't need people to tell me what i should do i've just been thinking about things that's all
i can't believe i let him stay in my house right under my nose that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i didn't see him
if he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure
calm down let's do it anyway
god you you're mean
i know will you please leave now?
maybe i don't want to leave maybe i want to talk
john we have nothing to talk about
i knew it i knew it things are getting complicated
plenty of room for two people
it'll just be me
student?
no  you said threefifty?
plus first and last month deposit
oh come on price there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about sure our foreign policy is important but there are more pressing problems at hand
will you lease monthtomonth?
not for threefifty
everybody has a past
what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
yeah it's not bad usually ann has some serious salt action going i keep telling her you can always add more if you want but you can't take it out
i'm sorry am i prying again?
you were prying before?
yes this afternoon i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon
really how'd it go?
i wish i didn't have to live someplace
like what?
get rid of the car when you get your apartment then you'll still have one key
i like having the car the car is important
especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry
hi john
where are the tapes graham?
what tapes?
you know which tapes where are they?
john as a lawyer you should know that those tapes are private property
so is my wife asshole
she's not property john she's a person were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
what's that a gram?
what the hell do you think? i love ann you think i'm going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?

dr st luc? detectivesergeant heller i'd like to ask you a few questions
sure
you're the one who found the bodies?
yes
i'm leaving i'm getting out
did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?
no nothing
you knew these people?
i knew the man emil hobbes a doctor and a professor at university i saw the girl around the building but i didn't know her she never came to the clinic
so you just came up to visit this hobbes and you found them like that?
oh no i haven't seen dr hobbes since i was in medical school he taught me he was my prof in urology and i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology that was it i had no idea he'd ever set foot in starliner towers until today
it was very strange he called me at six this morning hobbes called me i thought i was dreaming i haven't heard that voice for so long he told me who it was then he said something like 'meet me at apartment 1208 at noon i want you to go out for lunch with me it's time you furthered your education' then he laughed and hung up i went back to sleep he called me again at eight to remind me to come
how did he sound this time? was he nervous? depressed?
and that was her annabelle horse field
is that the man who called you up here?
no he is here  shit
leaving what?
yeah that's dr st luc he's the head of our little medical clinic here
medical clinic?
yeah this is an island you know? takes too long to get into the city we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains
mrs ementhal's ready and waiting doctor
ok roger here's the stuff you wanted files on horsefield tudor swinburne and velakofsky papers published by hobbes linsky and lefebvre in a couple of issues of the bulletin of the canadian medical association and also the journal of the american medical association and as an added extra a couple of odds and ends from the files i helped compile before your time here doctor i thought they might interest you
that's great forsythe great thanks
kiss kiss?
another kiss?
c'mon forsythe are there any more on the list?
roger? if you're going to be staying here anyway why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
don't i'll drink it
meeting rollo at tudor's might take a while
anything wrong?
no i don't think so
well? supper at my place?
ok but late
forsythe forsythe what's wrong? what's happened?
where is he now? do you know?
i think i i think i killed him i stabbed him with something and he fell
will you be ok now? i've got to go to your place to see if he's still there i've got to see if it's if it's what we both think it is
but where are you going?
listen to me patrick i'm leaving
can i call you at the office?
what do you want to call me at the office for?
i don't know i just thought i might want to call you i don't know

do you want to make love? you're absolutely beautiful those eyes that expression you're absolutely the most sexy thing alive do you want to make love?
you will make love to me won't you janine? won't you make love to me? you start it won't you? i think i've forgotten how to start
oh nick nick i can't take this

we live in 703
yes? who is there?
it's dr st luc mr spergazzi let me speak to the nurse please
want me to breathe deeply?
good shape for an old man eh?
mr parkins what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
she had a couple just like them right here near her belly button you could push 'em around i thought they were kinda sexy myself
didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
didn't seem worried about them
i'm leaving iamleaving
was this girl from starliner towers?
yep she lived in 1208 but we usually went to my place bigger liquor cabinet bigger bed  she was gone when i got back from my last florida trip too bad had a beautiful tan  must have gone home to mother
was her name annabelle horsefield?
i'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few xrays taken i want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there ok? give them this the address is right there under radiology
gonna cut me open?
well let's wait for the xrays
not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you rog but it's all i got and  all i got i share with you go ahead take all you want
you touch my spleen rollo  and here all the time i was thinking  if i ever bothered to think about the good old days  well at least there's rollo he's in vd and he's happy
i'm still a vd man under the skin rog you know me i'm a downtoearth kinda guy right?
well at least you still talk the same
don't tell memerchant banking?
so who changes?
but you gave up your private practice suddenly you're into pure research and you you're what a parasitologist?
i know you're bored already transplants are yesterday's kishkas right?
did i say anything?
you put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney the bug attacks the bad kidney dissolves it it's assimilated by the body and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney i know what you're gonna say you're gonna say it's crazy
right it's crazy but here's the beauty part ready?  who cares?
i don't get it
rog i gotta talk serious to you really listen ya listening? ok i want you to come into this with me to tell the honesttogod truth i'm lonely  all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night he wanted you in anyway that's why we were gonna get together the three of us we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years even with inflation
rollo you know me once a gp always a gp
you want to help sick people for the rest of your life? god forbid i should talk you out of it
no you dumb son of a bitch i'm serious i'm disappearing
you oughta be careful yourself might end up cutting your throat
it was women did it to hobbes couldn't handle them that girl that annabelle  talk about crazy projects
who was she?
but you'll think about what i said about working together huh?
yes?
that you rog?
yes?
it's me rollo linsky remember me?
yeah well i'm flattered but you won't find any real meat in them
no? how come?
and bateman what are you so fucking zany about?
ok i bite what does it look like?
it looks like  and i quote  'a disease to save man from his mind'
i don't get it
he didn't make it
huh?
maybe hobbes didn't know it but annabelle was a pretty popular girl around starliner towers i've got three men here maybe four who're hosting large freemoving apparently pathogenic abdominal growths that nobody i've tried can identify you were next on my list
i'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys
i've got a date with one of them at ten can you make it?
yeah  ah i don't want to panic you or anything but i mean the way hobbes designed them they're supposed to get out of hand real quick so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream i dunno but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive maybe even bizarre sexual things
yeah? what do i do then?
dorsia
ok it's apartment 1009 south tower starliner towers may as well go there directly
night night
night night
got the hot flush symptoms and i'm feeling freaky
young male intern tall and handsome
got my hem so high they'll say i'm being cheeky
breaking out
breaking out
breaking out
breaking out
marcus halberstam for two at eight?
breaking out
you bet bert
later brenda  ah bert could you spare a moment?
how's brad?
a wreck
check  the quacks are willing tools?
fools
i wouldn't mind doing janet one or two favours
sank you  velcome  sank you
what's cookin' bert?
don't worry about him  think about yourself
dorsia yes?
they should be sent to the danube before dawn
what?
about brad's family?
you got it
i got it  i got it
infantile regression
you got it
introduce yourselves
we've been hearing some bad things about you brad
i know i know it's just
we are totally booked
do you watch 'dentonvale' janet?
i've caught it once or twice
i know he's boring but neurospecialists  that sounds pretty drastic
is it because i'm becoming too popular?
right  an early start with janet's debut on 'good morning denton' by the time we unveil farley's 'faith factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep
can i just 'peep in' on brad before i go home?
when do i get to see brad?
buthow?
siniful
dear old bert's settled everything
oh really? that's great
how did you come by this scenario?
i am in farley's employ  and  we're discussing a network deal
why janet?
everyone loves the girl next door particularly farley
in my time they used to call me the merlin of berlin
of course mrs majors  janet  but i'm puzzled  if she was so keen on getting him in here why wouldn't she sign the contract?
no it wasn't janet  exactly  it was in fact your new sponsor
sponsor
dentonvale has been sold
with fast food farley at the helm it'll be tv dinners from now on
i said we are totally booked
we're the experts
out of self comes selflessness
in a way
i detect a note of reticence are you perhaps one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
thank you so much judge wright for another wonderful interview
judge wright?  now betty? first name terms surely
oh oliver you're so tolerant time for a coffee before you rush off?
delighted betty  that is if you don't mind being seen with an older man
a free thinker
macy struthers  god i must have been blind  still the weaker the man the dumber the blonde
two at nine? perfect
mckinley?mckinley?
conspiracy?  that sounds a little farfetched
it's happened before  remember lieutenant orpheus?  he disappeared into that underworld series and never came back
sounds like my husband  he never came back either  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break
conspiracy is right  the denton dossier is
i bet that macy struthers had a hand in this  we'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips
now betty don't overreact
overreact  you're the one with theories about conspirac  oliver?
yes betty
clever of you to find this spot betty
there are no tables available tonight the waiting list is also totally booked
a 'stately pleasure home' indeed
look  look at that  bert schnick can see  whyhe'sdancing
did you /hear/ that oliver
care to indulge?
indulge?
betty it's imperative we get janet out of flavors' fast fingers and brad out of that hellhole before they both disappear forever if only i could place that name  mckinley?
he was a president
president?  past presidents betty this is beginning to add up
really  what'll i pin this on?
some people do it for enslavement
late?
oh  ah i'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am i?
not at all  you have your life  and i have mine
i'll leave you young things to it
shove it ralph
oh oliver  what are we going to do?
that's us
i don't want to get up there
i'm not going janet
what are you trying to do?  make bert look like a fool?  he's made all the arrangements
i'm looking for love
aerobics class sorry any messages?
some people do it for compassion
some people do it for the fashion
some people do it to be funny
i've took as much of you as any man can you've lost your heart
you've lost your cause
an' you're a weeper and a wailer always treading the toes of the great generally spreading your weight you're a spiteful hateful asinine creature a pupil with no scruples who knew better than the teacher
i've took as much of you as any man can
you've lost your heart
you've lost your cause
some people do it for for each other
ricky hendricks has to cancel today he didn't say what he was canceling or why
some people do it for for their lovers
some people do it for for improvement
some people do it for movement
some people do it for for enjoyment
you'll find a rambling rose and a picket fence
mental instability?
he was adopted you know
i'd forgotten
what are you talking about? danny slepstrini is a chip off the old block  i played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week  and hank says danny's moved to new york  to better himself
oh harry  what are we going to do?
i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club anyone else?
wellmaybe i could wear my black leather brogues?
like a virgin with an' urgin' in a surgery i'll be swinging  i'll be bringing out the nurse in me
mr  flavors  may i have a moment of your time?
sure thing
we've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight  is this true?
absolutely correct
could you tell us a little about it?
let's just say that i'm putting sanity back on the national menu
could i do that later?
but they only think they're happy
what about my movie rights?  book rights?
andspencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier 17
i won't be a party to this  i want to see brad
the question is does brad want to see you?  quite frankly he hates you
it's only one night janet let's not forget who we're doing this for?
brad  oh brad

i'mhappy
brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you
me?
i want to see brad
is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
you are the most desirable creature that ever walked
if only brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me
he will  but it's up to you to reawaken his feelings  you've got to be fabulous look think and appear fabulous  and farley's given you that chance  you can use the breakfast show to knock denton dead
justsayno
do you really think so?
you've got a really tight team around you  and everybody needs you
but what'll i do?  what'll i say?  what'll i wear?
  for his own good
brad
brad

it's you we're concerned about janet
that's an extremely negative response
this is the nerve center of operations janet  you must stay here tonight  that way we can all be here when mr sun paints us a new day with his golden brush
i feel the heat from your skin and the stubble on your chin you're no good
you've got dirt on your hands and everybody understands you're no good
what a joke
what a joke
you fel like choking you play for broke

oh romance is not a children's game
that minimal
criminal
this could be worse than the old series
hi  macy struthers  cohost on the f f show
ah macy  why don't you help janet freshen up before rehearsal
so all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us
this could be the start of a whole new career here
like a deep plum lipstick and some therapeutics
and none of them worked?
i'll do it
and we also know how you feel we're not strangers to confusion
isn't she lovely?
mommy and daddy love you baby

so what's up?
really? because i don't know i was thinking that 
look i haven't really focused on that kind of thing
yes?

the problem with that is that then there's one extra 
then put him with the feldmans whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me
don't dismiss me i'm trying to include you in this decision he's your friend
i didn't dismiss you i told you what i thought but it didn't seem to matter so you decide besides this is supposed to be my time with miles i hope you're not going to call every five minutes
i'm not going to call every five minutes but this is important
why are you being so defensive?
i don't know christine perhaps it's because i feel attacked
i ask you one simple question and suddenly i'm attacking you
listen i'll call you when we get there and we can talk about it then okay?
is that the ransom file? thanks don't wear that outfit again
bye
i love you

i can't help the traffic
come on you're fucking hungover
who?
why did you tell them my book was being published?
you said you had it all lined up
no i didn't what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum
yeah conundrum
and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor she was supposed to hear something this week but now it's next week and it's always like this it's always a fucking waiting game i've been through it too many times already
i don't know senior editor? sounds like you're in to me

what's your cut?  how much?
tell him i'm at lunch
yeah
oh that's tasty
100% pinot noir single vineyard they don't even make it anymore
pinot noir? how come it's white? doesn't noir mean dark?
jesus don't ask questions like that up in the wine country they'll think you're a moron
just tell me
color in the red wines comes from the skins this juice is free run so there's no skin contact in the fermentation ergo no color
did you read the latest draft by the way?
oh yeah yeah
and?
patrick?
i liked it a lot a lot of improvements it just seemed overall i don't know tighter more congealed or something
how about the new ending? did you like that?
oh yeah much better
there is no new ending page 750 on is exactly the same
whoa why are we getting off?
i've just got to make one quick stop won't take a second
what?
i thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother
your mother? jesus miles we were supposed to be up there hours ago
how old's she going to be?
yes patrick?
um seventy something
let me show you something the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released you keep pressure on it so you don't 
this saturday mom remember? we told you
fuck man too early in the morning for that you know what i mean?
she's a kid jack i don't even look at that stuff anymore
that's your problem miles
as if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place
speak for yourself i get chicks looking at me all the time all ages
it'd be the best thing for you you know what? i'm going to get you laid this week that's going to be my best man gift to you i'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit
i'd rather have a knife
jean?
no no you've been officially depressed for like two years now and you were always a negative guy anyway even in college now it's worse  you're wasting away teaching english to fucking eighthgraders when they should be reading what you wrote your books
you still seeing that shrink?
i went on monday but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer
well i say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take xanax?
and lexapro yes
well i say fuck that you need to get your joint worked on that's what you need
jack this week is not about me it's about you i'm going to show you a good time we're going to drink a lot of good wine play some golf eat some great food enjoy the scenery and send you off in style
you know what? let's take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first
whatever's closest man i need a glass
these guys make topnotch pinot and chardonnay one of the best producers in santa barbara county  look how beautiful this view is what a day
yes patrick?
i thought you hated chardonnay
hey miles i really hope your novel sells
so what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
i told you filet and salmon
yeah but how are they making the salmon? poached with a yogurtdill sauce? teriyaki? curry?
i don't know salmon don't you always have white wine with fish?
oh jesus look at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference
let me call christine
doesn't have to be now let's go taste
baked with a butterlime glaze
that isif you're not doing anything
this is rose right?
good yeah it is a rose only this one is rather atypically made from 100% pinot noir
first take your glass and examine the wine against the light you're looking at color and clarity
what color is it supposed to be?
depends on the varietal just get a sense of it thick? thin? watery? syrupy? inky? amber whatever
huh
what do you smell?
huh maybe a little strawberry yeah strawberry i'm not so sure about the cheese
that's what you do with every one
when do we get to drink it?
oh no i have no plans
how would you rate this one?
you know you could work in a wine store
are you chewing gum?
hey jack hurry up
i thought you said it was close now i'm all pitted out
it's not even a mile
we should have driven
not with the wine list these people have we don't want to hold back
you think i'm making a mistake marrying christine?
whoa
anywhere you want?
come on do you think i'm doing the right thing? tell the truth you've been through it
well you waited for good reason and you proposed to christine for some good reason so i think it's great it's time you've got to have your eyes open that's all i mean look at me i thought victoria and i were set for life
christine's dad  he's been talking about bringing me into his property business showing me the ropes and that's something considering how long it took him to get over i'm not armenian so i'm thinking about it but i don't know might get a little incestuous but mike does pretty well a lot of highend commercial stuff
so you're going to stop acting?
no way this would just provide some stability is what i'm saying i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there you know keep myself in the game in case something big comes along
uhhuh
we're not getting any younger right? and my career well it's gotten pretty you know frustrating even with my new manager maybe it's time to settle down
if that's what feels right
it does feels right
then it's a good thing
let's not think about what i want how about anywhere you want
yeah tight
here's to my last week of freedom
oh yeah that's maya
you know her?
sure i know maya
you know that chick?
jack this is where i eat when i come up here it's practically my office and sometimes i have a drink with the employees maya's great she's worked here about a year maybe a year and a half
she is very hot
doesn't mean shit when christine was a hostess at sushi roku she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her think it worked? fuck no how do you think i met her?
this gal's married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara
oh patrick i can't make this decision
so what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? obviously that's over
jesus she's jammin' and she likes you what else do you know about her?
well she does know a lot about wine

and what about stephanie? she's a woman  with a kid a single mom what do you think she's looking for? huh?

that's thoughtful
so how did stephanie know it was saturday? we didn't get into that with gary

huh let me think
you sure you didn't say anything to maya?
what's it look like to you?

i'm thinking it's time to settle down one woman one house you know it's time
i bet you that chick is two tons of fun you know the grateful type
she gets off in an hour so i think i'm just going to have a drink and then make sure she gets home safe
fucking chick's married

well i guess i do for a long time i was too focused on my work i think but now i've really begun to think about changing myself you know developing andgrowing
her husband works a night shift or something and he comes home and i'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass
jesus jack jesus and you walked all the way back from solvang?

hey jack jack

yep quite a day
want me to drive?
no i'm okay
hey why don't you invite maya to the wedding?

come on let me drive
i'm fine you rest
what's wrong?
what the fuck
you said it looked like a car accident
what the fuck
look at this
i don't know doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one

uhuh you're on your own
so i'll see you at the rehearsal

hey don't pull away till they see the car
yeah  hey why wasn't i injured?
hey miles good to see you
oh uh tape duct tape ineed it for taping something bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun
maya how are you?
i'm doing good good you look great did you lose some weight?
oh no actually busy night
oh yeah sunday night you guys been out tasting today?
you want to join us?
so how's that book of yours going miles? i think you were almost done with it last time we talked
i finished it
yeah i know what you mean it's a long drive up here where're you staying?
well good to see you miles jack
what are you drinking?
whatno put it in the carton
a fiddlehead sauvignon blanc
oh yeah? how is it?
nice very nice
twelve months in oak
on a sauvignon blanc?
i know the winemaker she comes in the restaurant all the time
this is good little hints of clove
i'm having the salmon
are you all right?
hi
sorry 
hey
she got anything good?
so what gems do you have in your collection?
not much of a collection really i haven't had the wallet for that so i sort of live bottle to bottle but i've got a couple things i'm saving i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc
seriously the '61s are peaking aren't they? at least that's what i've read
yeah i know
it might be too late already what are you waiting for?
the day you open a '61 cheval blanc that's the special occasion
how long have you been into wine?
i started to get serious about seven years ago
jean? what?
what was the bottle that did it?
wow we gotta give it a moment but this is tasty really good how about you?
i think they overdid it a bit too much alcohol overwhelms the fruit
is this stephanie's kid? sure is cute
yeah siena's a sweetie
is she sleeping or?
you got kids?
who me? nah i'd just fuck them up that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce  no kids
it's kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanie's house all those times you came into the restaurant it's like you're a real person now almost
yeah i know it's kind of weird out of context
i'm looking fori guess you could say i just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special
yeah weird but great
so what's your novel about?
well it's a little difficult to summarize it begins as a firstperson account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke kind of based on personal experience but only loosely
what's the title?
"the day after yesterday"
oh you mean today?
um yeah but it's more
so is it kind of about death and mortality or?
mrnmm yeah but not really it shifts around a lot like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father and some other stuff happens some parallel narrative and then it evolves  or devolves  into a kind of a robbegrillet mystery  you know with no real resolution
wow anyway i think it's amazing you're getting it published really i know how hard it is just to write it even
yes i don t think i cancontrol myself
yeah thanks
like me i have this stupid paper due on friday and as usual i'm freaked out about it just like in high school it never changes
a paper?
yeah i'm working on a masters in horticulture chipping away at it
horticulture? wow i didn't know there was a college here
i commute to san luis obispo twice a week
so you want to work for a winery or something someday?
well
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car it's not fully proofed but if you're okay with a few typos
oh yeah who cares? i'm the queen of typos  wow this is really starting to open up what do you think?
thirtypercent  no more  or i call another lawyer  this is the biggest case of your life  don't try to negotiate  thirty percent  say yes or no
if you stay i think something bad will happen i think i might hurt you  you don't want to get hurt do you?
my palate's kind of shot but from what i can tell i'd dub it pretty damn good
can i ask you a personal question?
sure
i mean cabernets can be powerful and exalting but they seem prosaic to me for some reason by comparison how about you?
what about me?
i don't know why are you into wine?
i suppose i got really into wine originally through my exhusband he had a big kind of showoff cellar but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate and the more i drank the more i liked what it made me think about
yeah? like what?
bathroom over there?
you know how to get back to the windmill right?
and don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with frederick bennet and charles rust at '21
got it
i had a good time tonight miles i really did

i don't feel much
tell morgan to play games  it's okay to be silly
i will
tell bo to listen to her brother he'll always take care of her
i will
tell graham 
i'm here
and tell merrill to swing away
you do?
why?
i've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights can't tell what they look like cause they're staying in the shadows  covert like no one's got hurt mind you and that's the give away
i see
it's called probing it's a military procedure you send a reconnaissance group very small to check out things not to engage but to evaluate the situation evaluate the level of danger make sure things are all clear
i got the bat at home on the wall
five the five longest
okay this guy is trying to scare us he's messed with our property he's coming around the house it's time for an ass whoopin'
explain act crazy?
curse and stuff
i'm not going to curse
you don't mean it it's just for show
justsayno
it doesn't sound natural when i curse
just make noises then
explain noises
are you going to do this or what?
no i'm not
i cursed
it was very dark
it was very dark
this guy got on the roof in like a second
that roof is over ten feet high
what is it patrick? are you alright?
pharmacy crowded?
it's noise
it's probably picking up another baby monitor
morgan be careful
do you think it's a possibility?
yes
how can you say that?
that wasn't the answer you wanted?
do you feel comforted?
yes
so what do you do?
for the kids protection all they were doing was watching tv from five am i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said they should be playing furry furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
what's furry furry rabbit?
that's a game isn't it?  anyway  there's been some interesting developments
what time is it?
they caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning they found the bird his head crushed in when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky  they think they have some invisible shield thing going like an optical illusion
the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell
where are you going?
i'm sorry what book is this?
chicken teriyaki
should we turn off the lights?
what do you think i do?
they're on the roof
this is going to do nothing
did i ever tell you i dislocated uncle merrill's arm?
should we make a run for it out the back?
he was only a year and half old
what are you doing?
we won't be able to get out of there
merrill 
merrill
they're distracting us?
a model? an actor?
i can feel air
me too
it's getting stronger
they're broadcasting
how many died?
they think over a hundred thousand they're just estimates  but we held strong
how do they know it's over?
no
he's been like that for awhile we need to get him some medicine
have they said anything about our area?
what else do you need?
no flattering but no
he's not strong enough to fight off another attack
that's good enough for me
don't touch him
graham
can i use bo's old baby monitor as a walkietalkie?
yes
it needs batteries
these are d's; i need double a's
it's still making the noises it's broken
we might lose the signal
well
i'm getting out now
morgan?
so the aliens can't read our minds
oh
it says they're probably very small  like my height  because as their brains developed there was no use for physical development it says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet
scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs
dr bimboo one of the authors of the book 
bimboo?
dad
tell me something morgan in that book of your did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
weltit depends why?
they said one of two things could happen one they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later
what's two?
what do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
we'll have to board up the bedroom doors
where are we going to sleep?
what about isabelle?
french toast and mashed potatoes
stop crying
they'll read our minds
i can't even imagine
oh really? daisy he said  he said you gave him bad vibes
did someone save me?
it's the strangest thing father
don't call me father
what's that?
don't call me father it's just graham now
you said something was strange what's strange?
the footprints
what about them?
it's not broken
second thing this week i can't explain
that'sthat's too bad
what was the first thing?
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior sometimes violent behavior theo henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow
sounds like a virus
you can't describe him at all? don't you think that's find of odd?
it does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
i don't know whether to look for a midget or a 
he definitely wasn't a midget
okay  so he was tall?
let me ask you two something don't be embarrassed by the answer it is possible just possible now you might have been chasing each other around? you said you went in opposite directions
i don't think so
you think i'm dumb don't you?
do you owe anybody money? you can tell me off the record if you need too
is anything missing?
but i'll tell you something what i said in their still goes you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago
and three weeks
it's left its mark still the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world take them into town get their minds  your mind on everyday things it's good medicine
it's good advice  say hi to marcia for me
there was an accident drunk driving they weren't sure
is he okay?
she's not in an ambulance father
why not?
what?
see father ray's truck swerved off the road and ah hit colleen and then a tree she was pinned between the two
the truck the truck has severed most of her lower half
is that him?
don't do it
they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver
it's like war of the worlds
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world  nothing really bad is going to happen is it uncle merrill?
the book says they're probably very good problem solvers
what book
i wouldn't do that you're going to need every gun when that posse gets here
you think i'm dumb you think all models are dumb
posse? what the hell you talking about?
you brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if i mind mister i don't know any of those names and you're about to die
i'd get down if i were you they may be up there now
no money eh?
if we charge them they won't have a chance but we gotta get to the horses
emmett am i glad to see you
howdy jake what's going on here?
all i did was kiss a girl
that's why they got you in jail?
so i did i got out of there i don't want no trouble you know me  so i walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back
no i really don't
and you had to kill him?
no no no i winged him and he dropped his gun
well no not exactly see then his friend opened up on me
what friend is that?
jake i'm going to ask you once  was it selfdefense?
i think we lost 'em
forget the money you've got to get these people out of here this is no place to be sitting with women and kids
well kate it was selfdefense sure enough but i think you'd have to say i killed old murdo i think that's definitely the word
emmett
i didn't know you were out
hi patrick i thought that was you
that's all over as far as i'm concerned emmett i'm satisfied
sounds good
forget it
after the war my family worked a little piece of land near savannah for a while but the way it was down there then well they made it hard every way they could finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction by that time i was so sick of farming i didn't want to touch another hoe ever i wouldn't come with 'em my daddy took it pretty hard him my ma and my little sister headed out without me they've got a little place south of silverado i guess they've done okay good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time she said they needed my help to work the place that was almost nine months ago she wrote letter took a while to find me but when it did it was just the right time
where were you?
maybe we'll see you sometime
gotta go
where are we?
i'd be worse if you hadn't come along
i didn't just come along i was looking for you  jake said you were out there i saw him in town and he told me about that business the other night said you boys took a henry off one of mckendrick's men i wanted to see it
i need to know about your background  i need to know about your upbringing  why you're here
well
this was my father's the men who killed him took it
i gotta get to my brother if they came after me they'll want him too
you'll never make it
i'll go i'll bring jake out here
be careful you're in it now and it's gonna get mean
i almost didn't
where's jake?
mckendrick's men got him
kate?
gotta go
isn't it ridiculous? coming all the way up here but you know they really are the best
more than enough
have you thought at all about your plans?
the parkers seem like nice folks
they've been kind to me
paden sends his best
i'm surprised to see you out here tonight
i just came out to say goodbye
goodbye?
you came all the way out here to tell me you're going to california? all you had to do was go and we'd never see each other again
you don't make it easy on a fellow
well i mean um it s reallybosco you know like like a dove bar it's a dove barhershey's syrup?
maybe you thought you'd be back this way someday
are you all right?
this is a brutal land
you must have known that before you came
we told sheriff cobb about the attack  he said he'd look into it  i can't believe he's the law out here now i see why you all wear guns
how's mr parker doing?
weren't you going to come out to say goodbye?
i already did that
this time you're really going?  you know where i'll be
i've got my people sitting down there  swatting flies and raring to go
oh yeah oh i get it fun with chocolate
i'm afraid it is a bad start friend 'cause my name isn't baxter and he ain't hawley
you're not baxter?
my name is emmett
hobart what are you people doing here?
this is where baxter and hawley brung us
well they're wrong this territory is full of bad characters
i'm just meeting a guy here and moving on so far i haven't been able to find him
in my town when you're looking for someone you ask me
i guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right
ten am
hubert's? oh really? it moved uptown right?
maybe i ought to throw you in jail too then you could be with all your friends
i haven't done anything
i want you out of town before the hanging
two of the horses ran off but that pinto you're riding hung around
offend anybody lately?
jefferson city?
no leavenworth
i've never been in there they just jumped you out of the blue?
i had to get up anyway
me i'm riding along minding my own business four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while friendly as can be i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is don't make much difference we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me i guess they admired my horse she's a great one a sweet little bay
yeah well oh boy listen i've got to go thank you uh victoria?
looks like that's not all they admired
looks like those boys are headed south so they weren't the same ones that jumped me which way you going?
where's the pinto going?
i gotta stop by turley and meet a guy
where's turley?
south of here past chimayo
maybe i'll go along as far as chimayo get me some clothes maybe a bath
i see what you like she's mighty pretty
i gotta be going
going to turley was it?
maybe we could have lunch one day next week? you know i'm downtown near wall street quite often
what's turley like?
it's a town
they got a saloon there?
i expect
women?
doesn't look quite fair
shame about the kid seems a lively sort
he is that
i hate to see any man swing bad luck
you'll have to deal me out on that i've had some experience with that sort of thing and i don't want any more
oh i don't know victoria i'm at work all the time
i understand
it's not going to be easy
then i guess this is where we part ways sorry
no hard feelings
c'mon i'll buy you a drink
you haven't got any money
you know hanging around with you is no picnic
where you been?
i think i'll ride along with the lady here just take a look at this farmland before i come into silverado see what makes a trip this hard worth taking  i'll see you around
hannah's a smart pretty woman but she's got a hard idea for living
well what about oh you know maybe a saturday?
yeah?
all i'm saying is you won't trip over me if you look her up
cobb i want you to meet emmett he's a friend of mine  this is sheriff cobb
i'll see you around
you might make a farmer yet
daddy?
where is rae?
she's gone gone to town she hated working on the farm  just like you
what happened?
they run me off they burned me out they made it so i couldn't do just like georgia if you won't sell they take it anyway
next saturday?
who?
the cattle this valley runs down to a clear creek that's why we picked this spot and that's why they don't want us here
you own this land
i paid the government for it all right that don't mean much out here  malachi i'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills hiding out afraid to walk my own land
what about the law?
that's a lie
he acted bravely out there hannah just bad luck his getting hit could have been any one of us
i don't believe in luck i know what conrad was like don't tell me what you think i want to hear
never will again
mr and mrs parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine we'll work them together  mine starts right over there it's all i've ever wanted pretty land isn't it?
tell me about yourself  what you did as a young boy what your parents were like
what do you mean she was a hot number
a lot of men have told me that maybe it's true i guess some women are slow to believe it
believe it
they're drawn to me by that but it never lasts
why?
because they don't like what i want
what's that?
jt's done everything he can i married a brave man augie take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking  mckendrick picked the new sheriff himself so jt can't even get the law enforced
augie's going to grow up here there's nothing wrong with the land it's just some of the people
the problem is emmett you killed the wrong mckendrick
it was not  it was murdo's those mckendricks don't know how to act like human beings
she's mycousin
his son is worse than he was he's smoother so you don't always hear him coming but he'll do anything to keep his range free
you mean you ain't coming with emmett and me?
i can't say i'm convinced you're going anywhere
sure we are we're leaving at dawn
i've got no reason to run it was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses
yeah that's what happened with me too
the other guy drew first
didn't he tell you about blind pete?
we didn't get that far
that's the longest i ever did it 'bout bust a gut
uh huh?
what now?
where's your brother?
this a friend of yours?
he is now
who is he?
get out of here jake
all i did was kiss the girl
that's what you said in turley you remember how that ended
what's the matter paden? you afraid i couldn't get those two behind me?
new record
elizabeth it's three in the morning
kelly get over here  you didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money did you?  kelly meet my friend paden
howdy
you wanted to see me?
what are you talking about?
i'm done talking get out
you can't do this
there are three strangers in this room traveller and these gents you are accusing aren't them  are these your friends?
i wanted a drink and a bed i guess i came to the wrong place
came to the wrong town i don't tolerate this kind of thing it's hard on the peace and it's hard on the furniture now knowing a bit about carter here i'm going to let you go without paying for the damages but go you will and i mean now
is there a place in town that takes my kind?
he's a goddamn drug dealer these are his peak hours
you misunderstand i want you out of town in fact i want you all the way out of my jurisdiction
that ain't right
what's all this then?
this nigger's breaking up my place sheriff langston
i don't like that word much carter
we don't serve them here and you know it i asked him to leave and he went crazy on us he owes me money for this damage
who's going to pay for all this sheriff?
now let's talk about you chaps
we'd rather stay
we'll see about that i'm sheriff john langston as you may have guessed i am not from these parts
don't tell him you're here
you're kidding
the jury saw it differently
so this is the guy you're going to hang?
tomorrow morning ten o'clock
hello rae
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family
he was murdered
who did it?
i'm not sure but i got an idea and when i am sure they're going to pay
what are you doing here rae? this ain't for you
this tastes weird  harley? it's me i need your services translate that anyway you'd like i'm at
it's none of your business
rae all we got is each other
get out we have nothing to talk about
rae i need help
why come to me?
because you're my sister there's nobody else  the men who killed daddy are after jake i gotta talk to him
what's stopping you?
they're watching the hollis place i can't get through
what makes you think i could?
why would they stop you?
you're at paul owen s
why him?
this is it gents my ma told me to head south past that rock
why are they doing this mal?
because they enjoy it
i heard from stella you were trying to find jake what happened to emmett?
i got there just short of too late
yeah it's working out real good
he must be pretty good
he's good all right too good for my men that's why you've got to take care of it
what about his brother?
who?
things are getting messy around here  i hear ezra johnson got himself killed
i heard that too
hello cobb
i see you're prospering without me
it's been a while
appreciate the loan i'm good for it
let's talk about that  i'm looking for some men
i've given that up
so have i i've got a legitimate job now i can use a guy like you
you've got a legitimate job
paul owen
yes sir you wouldn't believe it
this is mighty sweet paden i think i finally found my place in the world
you got a place to stay?
i just got to town
what brings you into my saloon?
luck i guess
good old paden i was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job
nothing like that will happen between us
i took out thirteen dollars
this is a lot of money
my father always degraded me  killed my selfesteem  and my mother was blind
did you know that guy who disappeared? didn't he work at pierce & pierce too? was he a friend of yours?
i told you this was a sweet setup
it is that
easy boy just an idea
well thanks but forget it
what is it you want from me?
nothing do nothing don't get between us
i'm a great believer in doing nothing
so we understand each other?
i'm going to have to look into this
yeah maybe i will too
no
i thought we talked about that
you gotta calm down paden everything will be put straight in a few days
i never could count on you to be reasonable  don't force me to make an adjustment around here
cobb you've got nothing i need
i'm not thinking about your future paden i'm worried about stella
what's she got to do with it?
what a waste this could have been such a sweet deal for us
yeah bad luck  goodbye cobb
you work here?
nifty
listen i would just like to seethe two of youget it on what's wrong with that? it's totally diseasefree
the world is what you make of it friend if it doesn't fit you make alterations
i'll drink to that will you join me miss 
stella
stella are you the midnight star herself?
my compliments to you miss stella this is what i call a saloon
thanks that's what i call it too
and i know what i'm talking about
you like a good saloon?
it's the only place i'm happy
you wouldn't be needing any help around here would you? maybe with the gambling?
patrick you re a lunatic
that's kelly my socalled partner he runs that side
socalled?
yeah aside from being a loudmouthed lying cheat he's just the man i would have picked
why'd you go into business with him?
i don't own this place the man who does stuck me with kelly
who's the owner?
is this a fair mix?
i'm saving lives here the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather
what's this?
that's the good stuff
come on don't you find christie attractive?
you really are a gambler
where's the dog now?
what is it that i can't figure?
what do you mean?
what makes you say that?
if he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening
you sure? maybe that's the kind of friend i am
nah  what's he got? this is a nice saloon but there are other nice saloons it's not the money not for you why can't i get ahold of it?  cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about
some people think because they're stronger  or meaner  they can push you around i've seen a lot of that but it's only true if you let it be the world is what you make of it
i like your attitude but it can be risky
let's not get lewd  i'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation
how about you?
i don't want you to get hurt
i've got a place i can hide her
stella this is one of my oldest surviving friends treat him right
that was my plan
it's an advance we want him to know he's going to be happy here
i wouldn't worry about that
from what i've seen paden doesn't care much about money
 forgive me mr taransky  i'm just trying to understand  all these films tv appearances magazine covers internet interviews publicity photos snapshots from her childhood  all fake  this is fake this is fake  fake fake fake all fake
that's right  you understand perfectly  i will confess to fraud not murder
come on i think it would be a turnon
a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions  also bogus?
oh no  the fan club is real  but they were worshipping computer code  ones and zeros
so of course you couldn't kill simone because there never was a simone
of course
but not everyone's imaginary are they mr taransky?  i refer of course to edith
can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
it wasn't her body  it was her body of work
why don't you just come clean viktor?  tell the truth  you'll feel better afterwards
i am telling the truth
we all know what happened  in a fit of jealous rage you killed simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you
are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
i'd love to stop somewhere but i'm late  i'm on my way to see viktor now
no i understand  that's what i want to talk about  i don't know if you know this simone but viktor and i were married once
i can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go  i owe viktor everything
i think he owes more to you  but that's not important now  i know what's going on between you two
i want to reassure you elaine there's absolutely nothing going on between viktor and i
you don't have to protect my feelings simone  i don't blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world
my god are you alright simone?
damn   yes  i    i'm just a little tired listen elaine viktor and i  it's strictly a working relationship  we could never be anything else  we're just so different
exactly  you're a household name now  you're moving in entirely different worlds  that's why i hope you're not toying with viktor
it sounds like you still have feelings for him
no i'm not a lesbian why do you think i'd be into that?
we have a daughter together  i just don't want to see viktor get hurt
i don't know how many times i have to say this elaine but viktor and i are not in love  i only make love to the camera
christ   elaine i know how it looks but   it would mean a lot to viktor if you'd go with him to the oscars if you won't do it for him please do it for me
okay  for you
thanks  this is my exit so i 
i'm glad we talked
of course she is  no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her
no  you will not give in to that blackmailing bitch
god viktor  why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
 do you know what these are elaine?
well you went to sarah lawrence for one thing
hmm mike and ike's
not just any mike & ike's  cherry mike & ike's  do you know why i viktor taransky twotime academy award nominated director 
 viktor that was short subject
 i have a feeling you're going to tell me
 i'll tell you why  it is because miss nicola anders supermodel with a sag card god's gift to cinema has it written into her contract that all cherry mike & ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room and that any time she travels her nanny must fly with her first class
 what's wrong with that?
elaine she doesn't have any children  don't you see?  we're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the alist
the public decides who's on that list
please
it's the truth  those 17 superstars are our insurance policy  we can't open  can't make a profit without them
your mother was blind?
did you know that whitney houston's debut lp called simply whitney houston had four numberone singles on it? did you know that christie? whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatilethough she's mainly a jazz singerthat it's hard to take in the album on a first listening
we can hardly make a profit with them  upfront salary backend deal perks per diem percentages  they're mocking us elaine we're at their mercy  we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars  we used to decide who would play what role we told them what to wear what to say who to date  when they were under contract we could change their names if we wanted to  more than once
you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
well i do remember why i started out in this business  you seem to have forgotten  working in new york with cassevetes  we were trying to do something important shine a light in that darkened cinema 
 it's called a projector
 illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth
listen viktor i have good memories of those days too  but this isn't about that or you or me or some highminded ideal  this is business
spare me
you're not renewing my contract
i'm not taking away your daughter just your deal  you and i both know after the divorce i kept you on for old time's sake so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey  i called what's his name at warner's  he said he'd take a meeting  in july  i've fought for you viktor  you want to talk severance?
you can have everything  office car assistants  all i want is the picture
listen john i've got to go t boone pickens just walked in  just joking  no don't tip the owner of the salon okay john right got it  sorry about that
the picture's dead
so there's no problem  i can have the rights the negative too?
they're yours  but how are you going to finish it?  without a star there's no movie
i don't need a star  all i need is an actor  i'll reshoot the part cut out nicola and replace her with a real actor  a real leading lady
where is she?
good to see you too elaine
why isn't she with you?
viktor i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio
don't thank me  it was entirely simone's decision  do you have simone's check?
i don't have it on me  anyway it means a lot  have you read the reviews?  they're love letters  listen to this one  "simone has the voice of a young jane fonda the body of sophia loren the grace of well grace kelley and the face of audrey hepburn combined with an angel"
no i'm sorry i should've made an appointment  was that anything important?
almost right
i can't wait to meet her
i don't know if that's going to happen
why not?
as i say she's something of a recluse  that's how she's able to stay so pure  by isolating herself in her art
don't be ridiculous  i arranged a press conference
out of the question  a circus like that?
viktor it's my studio
sorry i didn't get her back in time
no problem  do you want to come in?
hi i'm donald kimball
viktor we simply have to talk about "eternity"
"forever"
whatever  i still haven't received simone's script notes
there aren't any  if the filmmakers are happy simone's happy  she considers herself an "instrument"
really?  oh so she's really going to do all this nudity?
well something has to be done about this budget  it's completely unrealistic  you allowed nothing for limousine service
she'll drive herself
hair and makeup?
she'll do her own  theater training
she was in the theater?  when? where?
hi pat bateman nice to meet you
i'll send you her resume
al least a contingency for wardrobe  any woman can go up a dress size
 i guarantee she won't gain an once  she's very disciplined
well we have to do something about this  "stuntwoman"
what about it?
there isn't one
no need  she does all her own stunts
even the fall from the plane?
even the fall from the plane
as i've tried to explain to you elaine  simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known she's about the work and only the work  lives for the work  she wants all the money up there   on the screen where it belongs she'd work for scale except i know you only respect people you pay a fortune
so what's the topic of discussion?
which accounts for your percentage  when do i get to meet this dream?
not today  she's learning her lines  you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget
listen viktor i want to talk to you now not as elaine studio head but elaine exwife  second exwife  you got lucky this last time but you need to be careful  we both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced simone to be in it
elaine talking to you now not as viktor director but viktor ex husband what the hell happened to you?
experience viktor  i've seen this a hundred times  young stars destroying the very people who discovered them  i'm worried about you that's all  this woman  she controls your destiny
simone does not control my destiny
stunning viktor  the hollywood foreign press is going to eat this up
i got them to remove the reflection  the mirror's metaphor  to show how her character's inwardly dead
that's genius viktor  was that simone's idea?
maybe you're right  twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father
i've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen
better late than never
i should fire you more often  the film's looking wonderful
you really think so?
yes  to be honest i never quite saw this film before  maybe it's the way simone is playing it  but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how that's the only way we can love  i think it's really going to mean something
thank you  i'll tell simone you liked it
i'd love to tell her myself  when are you going to let me meet her?
soon  soon
everyone i know has met her viktor
everyone you know is lying
 you can't go in there
you're not with the fbi or anything are you?
 it's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you viktor  if you can't handle her i will
so the secret's finally out viktor
 i can explain
the premiere was the first time i've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares
viktor you should have said something
she doesn't want pity
i'll tell you what  i know how much this means to you  i'll try to get her to plug the film  i'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show  taped
oh make it live  please viktor
she was there  she didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
she said you were very beautiful
nothing like that i'm just a private investigator
really?
elaine what are you doing tonight? would you like to go somewhere  dinner?
i'd love to  but aren't you supposed to meet up with simone?
 viktor are you with her?  is she there?
are you and simone   getting married?
no of course not  why?  would you care if we were?
well yes  from a studio point of view it would be better if simone stayed single  anyhow i thought she came across great tonight  intelligent well informed a natural  and touching she was spectacular
viktor do you realize you always do that?
do what?
whenever i compliment simone you take the credit
ah i seeyes paul's disappearanceyes
i do?
yes you do  anyway tonight was a good start
excuse me?  start?
my two favorite girls
 simone
she's lying down  she's exhausted
elaine it's wednesday
is it wednesday?  it's wednesday how embarrassing  i don't know what i was thinking  with all the excitement lately  am i interrupting something?  are you expecting company?
as a matteroffact i am
when is she coming over?
yeah she went blind giving birth to me she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me
so it's nothing that official i just have some basic questions about paul owen about yourself
about now  would you like a drink?
is simone back to earth yet?
not quite
i'm sure you'll keep her focussed she's lucky to have you viktor  is she really having your baby?
impossible
i just read somewhere 
i know  i know  they'll say anything
 she already is  simone's not coming over elaine  not tonight not ever  i want you back elaine
this is crazy  who am i fooling? i can't compete with simone  what woman can?
i would rather have you than simone  believe me
coffee?
that's sweet viktor but i couldn't let you do that  make that kind of sacrifice  it's strange  i've stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where i am  it goes with the territory  but for some reason i can't betray simone there's i don't know any other way to say it  there's a goodness to her
no there isn't  there's nothing to her
oh viktor  you say that now  because we're here alone like this  but in the morning you'd go back to her  what man wouldn't?
no i will end my relationship with her  totally
but you don't understand  she'll always be there  at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen
no  she'll never work again  retire never make a movie or a record or appear ever again
of course she will  her public will demand it
not if i don't let her
i'm going to tell you a secret now elaine  simone is not a real person  i invented her
every actor is an invention viktor  don't embarrass yourself no one's denying that you discovered simone  but it's like finding a diamond in the desert anyone can trip over it but it's not the finder who sparkles
no i'm okay
 no no i didn't trip over her you don't understand 
 you just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you maybe she's staying out of pity who knows?  she certainly doesn't need you  some people even say you're holding her back
who says that  ?   never mind  you have to listen to me elaine  simone is thin air pixels molded by me from a mathematical equation  i inherited it from a madman  i can show you 
how much wine have you had?
 she's a figment of my own imagination  i viktor taransky have perpetrated the greatest hoax the greatest sleightofhand sleightofmouth sleightof sleight in entertainment history and still no one appreciates me recognizes what i've done  even you
you're drunker than i thought  are you doing that again?
can i see you later  go away for the weekend?
thank you  i don't know how you did it but thank you
don't thank us too fast viktor you know what we have to do?
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
perrier? san pellegrino?
i was thinking  what about you and "simone" moving back in with me and lainey?
don't look so glum viktor  it's not a death sentence
hello?
hello is this elaine?
yes  oh my god  is that you simone?  i've been wanting to talk to you
well here i am  you look pretty today  red suits you
where are you?
mom do you miss dad?
thank simone for the tickets
let's go lainey  there's nothing here
kimball
god it's so like your father  why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  i can almost forgive him for killing simone  but denying her existence  i can never forgive that
because obviously she existed right?
i know it as surely as you're sitting here sweetheart  she was the most vital woman i ever met
so you did meet her?
of course  what are you suggesting?
i know it's embarrassing to admit it mom but when i think about it  honestly i haven't  i mean it feels like i have  i know more about her than members of my own family  she's even in my dreams but i realized going back through my diary they were all tv appearances near misses at parties secondhand rumor gossip on the internet  i've never actually seen simone up close touched her been in her physical presence  have you?
well i 
 we don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too
lainey there's no evidence that simone isn't real
you had no choice elaine  he's a liability
mr kimball a bottle of san pelle
i can't believe she's doing this  taking advantage of him this way it's cruel
why?
obviously this can't last  she's going to dump him  viktor won't be able to take that  he's too sensitive  it'll destroy him
elaine do you realize you can't stop talking about viktor?
thank god for you faith  i know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a standin  you don't know what a service you're performing for simone  shielding her from those animals
you understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the er   scent
of course
you look so so
 so much like her?
yes of course but very beautiful in your own right
oh no i'm okay
what? what did you say?
do what you do to simone
what i do to simone?
yes call me simone
simone?
yes yes again again  do what you do to simone  i want to know what it's like to be her just for one night
you're with me to be close to her?
"why are we here?  is that what you're asking jack? why are we here?  no why  just here"
well no one could accuse you of being overexposed simone  why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
i just think actors talk too much does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening friday?
well what's the topic of discussion?
don't i know it  that's the only reason i'm here now  to put the attention back where it belongs on mr taransky's film
you don't secretly want the attention?
because you have to understand frank these interviews  none of this is real  who i am on screen and who i really am are two totally different people
who are you really?
no i'm okay
let's talk about the work that you care so much about
sure  where would you like to start?
how about the nudity?
nudity has just never been an issue for me frank  for me clothes are just an option
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
the disappearance of paul owen
 simone the question on everyone's mind is simply "why?"
with everything that was going on in my life i just needed to drop out of sight for a while  i needed time  viktor bought me that time  i owe him so much
we all do  but now i understand you're eager to get back to work  and not the kind of work that we're all expecting
that's true  i can reveal that i am considering a career in politics
nicola anders is the only actress who can play that role
viktor i'm so happy for us
hello hal
the film  the chemistry  no reflections on nicola but simone and i  we were just so right together
you never were together hal
and still the connection was undeniable  i haven't read "eternity forever" but i know it's brilliant  and i know i would be perfect for clive
oh right well i haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything  not on "page six" at least
clyde
yes perfect  as a matter of fact i ran into simone on the lot the other day
really?  she didn't mention it
you'll never guess who i'm with you ran into him on the lot
it was more in passing
how will you do our love scenes?
body double
for her?
hal what are you doing?
viktor clyde simply has to get close to simone in this scene  he has to touch her  he has to
back in the czech republic?
i think his family wants this kept quiet
absolutely not
but she's right there  i must feel her
you can't
why not?
there's a wall between you 
 an emotional wall i know that's why 
 no  no  a real wall  you ran right through it
how did the wall get there?
is she here?
i'm fine hal  how are you?
understandable  lime?
you know i sometimes forget she has bodily functions
i know what you mean
no  in fact between us she doesn't really exist
 mr taransky mr taransky thank god  i've been trying to see you calling  your assistant wouldn't put me through  i told her it was a matter of life and death  i was afraid i wouldn't get to you in time 
 please get away from me
i did it mr taransky  i licked skin  i licked hair  i licked every part of her
you want me to call security?
i have her mr taransky  the answer to your prayers  the answer to this
i was misquoted
it's me mr taransky  don't you recognize me?  the future of film conference in san jose hank hank aleno  i was keynote speaker  you must remember my speech "who needs humans?"
no really i'm okay
that's right  you were booed off the stage  that's got to be  ?
 eight years ago  in that whole time i never left my computer
good for you hank
good and bad  they think that's what caused this  me eye tumor microwaves from the screen  it's the size of a grapefruit  heavy too
i'm sorry
you have to see her
i've seen them all before
not like this 
come on hank  a synthespian virtual actor  ?
 we call them "vactors"
just some preliminary questions that i need for my own files okay?
i need flesh and 
 flesh is weak
you already do  but my actor won't get old fat lazy or drunk  won't throw tantrums demand a body double script changes or a bigger trailer  the disney corporation has been using artificial actors for years
that's the point hank  no matter how good they are they're still mickey mouse  everyone's tried everyone's failed  it can't be done
it can  with my new computer code you and me we can do it together
i don't know anything about computers
that's why you're so perfect  you have something i don't have
what's that?
an eye  for performance  you know the truth when you see it  i know  i've seen your movies  i love your movies
you do?
shoot
"straw god" changed my life
you saw that?
i've seen every frame of your work you're the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision you and me art and science we are the perfect marriage
listen hank it's been a rough day  i'll call you about his next week
i won't be here next week  the tumor's inoperable  i'll be dead
harry  harry  can we have a minute?  what brings you here tonight?
i just came out to support my good friend simone
there's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
we've been seeing each other sure but we'd rather keep our relationship private
do i hear the sound of wedding bells?
how old are you?
hi dad
i'm sorry mom canned you
it's really not anything lainey  it's just 
don't feel too bad  mom runs the place and they still walk all over her  you're better off out of it
i'm going to finish the picture sweetheart  it's important
hi dad
your mother couldn't make it?
she's at the premiere of "a cold day in hell"  but i think she send someone from acquisitions
she still with kent?
not quite how i imagined it 
twentysix i'll be twentyseven in october
 you finished the film on your own terms that's what matters did you really do all the post yourself?
there was no other way
i missed you  i wondered if you were ever coming back
me too
well i can't wait to meet simone what's her last name?
you know i don't know
is she here tonight?
she's a miracle dad  where did you find her?
i saw her picture on the er internet  you really didn't notice anything  unusual?
can't you stop that?
where did you go to school?
why?
those things can be dangerous staring at a screen all day  you miss what's going on outside in the real world  you can lose yourself you should get out more  how are you going to meet boys?
i know plenty of boys
really?  who?  where do you meet them?  in a chat room?  how do you know he's not some middleaged freak?
dad i can spot a middleaged freak a mile away
okay  but you have to find a way to escape that thing
i do
how?
i read
you do?  still?  i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that
harvard the harvard business school
you were the one who insisted on it  reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four
okay dad
if anyone asks about simone 
 i know i don't know anything
exactly  don't you wonder where i'm really hiding simone?
one thing bothered me
i know hal is as stiff as always
so that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
goodnight daddy
hey lainey  how's your love life?
your address?
i do okay  how about you?
you know me  married to my work
dad you know i don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now  she broke up with kent
really?  too bad
she thinks you're with simone
lainey you know simone and i don't have a real relationship
i know but mom doesn't  maybe if it came from simone if simone spoke to mom  she could straighten things out  dinner maybe
dinner?  dinner's difficult  a phone call?
too impersonal  they have to meet facetoface
i'll see what i can do  you know lainey  i don't believe you've ever once asked to meet simone  don't you like her?
what do you think?
yeah yeahbad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind  and my father blamed me for her blindness
fiftyfive west eightyfirst street the american gardens building
i love you lainey
why didn't she thank you?
happy birthday lainey  do you like it?
it's fantastic  it's too much
it's the car she drove in "eternity forever"
i know  thank her for me
 i can't accept it  i don't want a car dad
why not?  i can get you something else  what do you want?
the old viktor taransky  i liked you better before  before all this  you were a loser dad but at least you had integrity  i can't stand to see you like this  clinging to simone's coattails  it used to be about the work and now it's all about her  and then she's not even grateful enough to thank you
no that was me
nice very nice
there you go again blaming yourself  can't you see what she's done to you  she's taking advantage mocking you  you deserve better than simone  i've got to go dad
about you and mom?
me and simone  what i did
 plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court  it's the best deal you're going to get
i could get the death penalty
you certainly will if you go to trial  a jury in this kind of ugly mood  you've killed an icon for god's sake
i didn't kill anyone bernard there was no one to kill
 no  i can't go along with this horseshit  just tell them they can fry me
what?
do i know you?
pardon me but are you okay?
max sayer  national echo
don't you have a real story to write?  why aren't you in latin america?
this is the story
i remember when the echo had class  the paper that could bring down governments
our leaders aren't presidents anymore  they're pop stars and screen idols  if woodward and bernstein were alive today they'd be right here in hollywood with me
so they're probably here  you might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world but i'm not buying it what's really behind this simone woman?  the public has a right to know  why is she staying out of sight?  and why the hell is she with you?  i don't want you to take this the wrong way viktor but you're not exactly cecil b demille  more runofthemill
she sounds like a prisoner taransky  are you holding her hostage?  are you some kind of svengali?
who's the hostage sayer her or you?  you look kind of "captive" yourself  while you're spending every waking hour obsessing over simone guess what i guarantee she doesn't even know you exist  get off my property or i'll call the cops
the cops?  the cops read my column to know who to bust  we're the only watchdog the public has  none of this is going away  we'll be here tomorrow and the day after that  until you slip up  and you will  you are looking at your shadow  because all these elaborate precautions with simone  every instinct in my body tells me it's not natural
i'm just trying to help you sayer i don't want you to be disappointed  it gets cold out here at night
who do you ask?
nice try  if we can't get to her through you maybe your family will be more cooperative  i can guarantee you taransky one way or another miss simone and i are going to get acquainted
nice boat taransky
it's a yacht
i know what you're up to
i don't have time for this sayer
it's bogus  you used an old library shot for the background
the background is
i've done my homework  i've studied her
 i bet you have
 i've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done the video in the supermarket there's no evidence she's ever left the studio  oh and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail  but i have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts  i know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her
bad habit
i'm keeping it in trust
i know that's what you'd like us to believe  but i got to tell you  embezzlement is a serious matter not to mention abduction
abduction?
what is it exactly you want sayer?
alright sayer you've got a deal
what now sayer?
i traced her to a nursing home  a young woman fitting simone's description dropped her off five years ago
she looks a lot like you
that doesn't prove a thing  wait until i get a court order for a blood test
that won't be necessary  sooner or later i knew you'd crack this thing max  you got me
would you rather i not smoke?
i do?  sure i do  can we speak off the record?  i'm a fair man  i'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story
i wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics
you love her don't you max?
don't you?
is it a jamming device?
maybe he's talking to himself
taransky isn't that good an actor no they're taking special precautions  some kind of new encryption
why?
whatever it is it's dark
dark?
no i guess it's okay
we've got our best people on it mr sayer
24hour tail on taransky?
shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes every concierge and maitre d' on the take  but this simone woman is good
well we got some of taransky's fingerprints a lot of your fingerprints but none of hers
of course  no one's that perfect that pure  you know i had something on mother teresa  but then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore  i know how to flush out this simone  a tellall story from her childhood
my god you've got one?
am i wasting my time with you? when she sues to protect her privacy she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it
long live the first amendment
mr sayer
what do you want  ?
you sure?
mr sayer did we pay the million bucks yet?
 cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning  worth every penny too  who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  we'll be running stills of this for months then release the whole tape  we'll get our money back  maybe show it on an exclusive payperview event do you realize what we have here? we have the only independent footage of simone in existence
 i've been here before  on my honeymoon with my exwife
it's a hotel
i don't understand
 nicola  how was your massage?
you're in breach
 is this about the new pages?  i made the changes you wanted you're in virtually every scene 
it's not the size of the role viktor  am i or am i not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
it's the biggest on earth  i swear  it's a 50foot airstream  they don't make them any longer than that
what can you tell me about paul owen?
taller viktor
i beg you  you can't do this to me
i had three other offers  i only signed on to this picture out of loyalty
then show some  they'll shut me down
a lot's happened since we last saw each other
yes
thank you  it's not important
would you like me to read?
you know you're really very good i take back what i said  i mean you're really good
thank you
how well did you know him?
you could play the lead
but that's simone's part
yes of course it is  you know you have a line here  not a wrinkle  actually more of a dimple  i've been thinking of incorporating something like that in simone
you'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me?
no one came in or went out just like you said mr taransky
good
is miss simone coming today?
she's already here  she arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone  remember under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission
what if it catches on fire?
hi
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
i'mat a loss he was part of that wholeyale thing you know
i'll do anything to please you mr taransky
i'm sorry i didn't catch that what did you say?
simone are you there?
let's take it down a notch
good morning simone
good morning mr taransky
a star is
you mean they buy it?
maybe he can
do you have any idea what this means simone?  our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it
yeahyale thing
i am the death of real
you are birth of what?  a phenomenon  a miracle  a new era in show business  all i wanted to do was finish the film
is that better mr taransky?
you did create me
no  i just helped bring someone else's dream to life
mr taransky we both know i was nothing without you  i was computer code  ones and zeros
see beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood  see that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake the scales have tipped in favor of the fake   see that if the performance is genuine it doesn't matter if the actor is real  once a performance is committed to film the blood and bones are gone anyway  only the spirit the illusion remains besides what's real anymore? these days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area
are you ever going to tell the truth about me mr taransky?
the only real truth is in the work
you know what i'm talking about
sothere's nothing you can tell me about paul owen?
speaking of which  this is the project i'd like you to do next
not "eternity forever"?  the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  i'd kill for that part
you're going to get in a lot of trouble mr taransky
mahogany i'd say that cost at least a couple hundred maybe three
three? we should hock it buy a cd rack for the bedroom
do you know how important this is? this is big time  i'm going to read it for you doctor
wow they called you their son
my god
are you calling me?
why malcolm?
he led what i suppose was an orderly life he ate a balanced diet
why did you leave me?
i just needed to do a couple of things  and i needed to tell you something
goodnight malcolm
on my way to the flea market in amish country thought maybe you want to come show me how to buy at these things
that's very sweet i'm okay
you know that's probably not the best idea i'll just wait to see them in the store
okay fine understood  i'm off then
don't step in the horse manure
your eye frames they don't seem to have any lenses in them
they're my dad's the lenses hurt my eyes
what kind of man was he? besides  the information you've just given
what was that you were saying before with your soldiers? day pro fun
all your soldiers speak latin?
what were they hiding from?
oh lots of things i suppose bad people for one people who wanted to imprison them hurt them
i forgot your name
dr crowe
you're a doctor what kind?
i got an award once from the mayor
congratulations
thank you it was a long time ago i've kind of been retired for a while  you're my very first client back
i hope i'm not being crossexamined here
you use needles?
no
not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
no
i'm going to see you again right?
and cole next time i won't be late for you
we were supposed to draw a picture anything we wanted i drew a man he got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver
everybody got upset they had a meeting momma started crying  i don't draw like that anymore
how do you draw now?
i draw people with smiles dogs running and rainbows  they don't have meetings about rainbows
do you feel that way?
you want to ask me a question?
private kinney's wife is really sick  she has something called a brain anism
you mean aneurysm
where should i look then cole?
i walk this way to school with tommy tammisimo
he hates me
you ever tell her about how it is with tommy?
i don't tell her a thing
why?
cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and i don't want her to i don't want her to know
no not really
know what?
you said the "s" word
mr marschal gets real lonely
what about mrs marschal?
so your dad lives in pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth
what if she has to pee when she's working? you think she just holds it?
what'd you write?
words
what kind of words?
think about what you want from our time together what our goal should be?
where did paul hang out?
something i want?
that isn't magic
what?
you just kept the penny in that hand the whole time
i didn't know you were funny
your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
once upon a time there was a prince who was being driven around he drove around for a long long time driving and driving it was a long trip he fell asleep  when he woke up they were still driving the long drive went on
dr crowe
yes
you haven't told bedtime stories before?
hangout?
no
you have to add some twists and stuff maybe they run out of gas
what makes you think that?
i don't know how the story ends i hope it's a happy ending
dead people like in graves and coffins?
no walking around like regular people they can't see each other some of them don't know they're dead
how often do you see them?
no
did you think the play sucked big time?
what?
that's what he did to me  he put cigarettes out on me
yeah you knowhang out
tommy tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial he thought everybody was selfconscious and unrealistic he said the play sucked big time
i know every child is special in their own way but tommy sounds like a punk  i thought the play was excellent better than cats
cats?
yes?
when they get mad it gets cold
can i ask you then?
yes
what do you want more than anything?
i don't know
i told you what i want
let me think the newport harry's fluties endochine nell's comell club the new york yacht club the regular places
i don't know cole
i have to
when?
i'm going to transfer you i know two psychologists that are exceptional
what?
don't cry
it means i wasn't what everyone thought i was  i was a fake
you weren't a paper champion
dr crowe?
yes
he had a yacht?
something happened didn't it?
yes it did
are you wigging out?
yes i am
we're not gonna start crying again are we?
no we're not
you really look better
maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in and then all of a sudden it's all taken away no one asked them it's just gone
you have nice red in your cheeks now
it's spanish it means 'i don't want to die'  not all the ghosts are scary are they? like mrs marschal?
no he just hung out there
no
just help
yes i think that's right i think they all want that even the scary ones
i believe both of you now  and i think i might know how to make them go away
what if they don't want help? what if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
she came a long way to visit me didn't she?
i wish i were somewhere else
don't go home okay?
i think we said everything we needed to say  maybe it's time to say things to someone else? someone close to you?
you were great in the play cole
don't you know this?
really?
and you know what else?
what?
they're right here
what are you thinking momma?
lots of things
it was grandma's it's not for playing  what if it broke? you know how sad i'd be
you'd cry cause you miss grandma so much
that's right so why do you take it sweetheart?
sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them it just gets moved
anything else you can tell me about owen?
you didn't take it before you didn't take it the time after that and now you didn't take it again?
don't get mad
there's only two of us  maybe someone came in our house  took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  is that what happened?
i'd give anything to have been there
communicate?
you know that accident up there?
yeah
someone got hurt
they did?
a lady she died
we were both seven in 1969
you can see her?
where is she?
cole you're scaring me

they want me to do things for them
what are you thinking momma?

i don't know
i would never think that about you ever got it?
she says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant she just likes it a lot
what?
cole that's very wrong grandma's gone you know that
she wanted me to tell you

hey isn't that the preacher?
dammit carl
there's something weird going on here suzie
no shit
i'm serious get this i had a careful look at that alternator it's clearly been messed with it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown
you're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm?
well i've had a hard time getting an actual verification a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but i checked it out and what happened is he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul so
come on 
carl what are you doing?
aaaaaaaaaaaa 
gene
missed you at church this morning jeremiah
you're not going to arrest me for it are you?
hell no but you missed a damn good sermon "you can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord"
sounds familiar
thought your boy and his band were only staying the night
you know one day i'm going to have to shut down that still of yours jeremiah
oh
motherfucking soundman i couldn't hear myself sing
i could you sucked
hey fuck you
okay my main man marvin gaye
wait a second did you say "patricide?"
yeah marvin's old man gunned him down
that's not patricide patricide is when you gun down your old man
all right "fratricide" minor technical detail
wrong fratricide is when you gun down your brother you're out my turn
fine be that way jim morrison
was he involved at all  do you think in occultism or satan worship?
nike specials two hundred bucks
"peggysue" 
damn these are one hundred dollar nikes
curt cobain

the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was
are you crazy?
hmmm this shit isn't bad
what?
so what does it do?
should we be doing this dude?
"old macdonald had "
"with a hackhack here "
"and a slashslash there "
he means moon shining
harvest moonshining
yeah man you were wrong suze my solo definitely works better in the second verse
carl oh carrrrl
we've got to call someone  get the sheriff
i know it sounds like a lame question but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question but last monthi don't know if you've heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
what are you going to do? shoot me?
depends you got some nerve intruding on a man's grief i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide now: who are you?
i'm your son and laureen's son
ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years my boy was taken from me far as i'm concerned he's dead now i ain't gonna ask you again  who are you?
joseph macdonald your son
i came back for the funeral that's all
i'll be gone again tomorrow
how was she "called?"
pardon?
that old barn after the fire i rebuilt it nail by nail just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it
out on my back when i was a small boy
yikes no paul wasn't into that he followed a balanced diet and
this is his room isn't it?
was you ain't afraid of ghosts now are you?
you got it wrong boy i'm not the monster you think
maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel
i wouldn't pay jesse no mind at all she's just a crazy old woman hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away  wasn't much right before that neither
old slave superstition you sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops you get yourself a good harvest so they say
you'll be back
you like it? irrigation system your grandaddy built it himself saved the land from dying
that's a good idea maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy jethro
sure what do you want to know
have you consulted a psychic?
people say he was a murderer
then who? because someone wants another blood harvest with human blood jeremiah just like jethro who did he kill back then jeremiah? farmhands? transients? people no one would miss? "crazy old macdonald" but now it's starting again isn't it? someone's picking up where jethro left off
 it's not me
it's time to make amends
amends?
think boy that night the night of the fire at the barn you were only six years old
throw me one
 and keep your eyes on the road
i'm admiring your costume what "movie" are you going as again?
never heard of it
no
i'm not surprised it's got a body count of zero and no one goes around in a stupid mask hacking innocent people to death
is that all you ever think of? suppose i was really hurt
dammit karen  i was just looking for your pulse
ow
what's wrong?
hey  macdonald's farm
jesus what a bunch of useless zombies
who? us?
hey could you be a little more insensitive? we're on our way to a funeral for crissake
you know what they say about men who need big guns
had his apartment been burglarized?
hey some klu klux klan homeboy gets in my face he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet
down boy

 trucking ain't the easiest life in the world i mean you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up but i like keeping on the move you know?
do i know? i'm an authority on it
i guess if there's one lesson i've learned it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target  i forgot your question?
you plan on driving trucks all your life?
i uh i don't know i guess don't like to think about it
an unmarked police car
how do you know?

and?
my very words

 did ya hear they nailed the bandit?
it's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything
so bill if i understand this right you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
that's correct
but how? where do you place paul that night?
but with these down doesn't that pose a major security concern if as you say you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
well we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras so
yes but no  we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall twentyfour hours a day
right now? a six man security force plus a member of our butler staff so seven men total
uh  well yes uh just in terms of the men up there now my team he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so 
c'mon bill you've got some sultan up there one of your whales big spender likes a lot of space you cook up this "construction" thing?
no no no we've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity due to the roof access
is your security team armed?
of course yes
anything on the swede?
according to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner withmarcus halberstam
only the mention made in that phone call there's no swedish hitman of any renown much less one with a million dollar day rate
maybe he's that good never been caught no criminal record
i tell you engineering this kind of play against sparazza going to the lengths these guys are going to they're playing some long odds
and a very bad gamble
spotter on the lake confirmed israel penthouse level there was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes he wasn't involved he's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls
unreal this guys jacket too wall towall major felony offenses murder extortion arson grand larceny    a paternity suit i just feel like we're playing catchup with all this and we shouldn't be
welcome to the new bureau nobody shares information anymore it's become synonymous with job security
but the bureau knew sparazza killed heller why not go after him guns blazing' for that one?
heller was buried in agency lore anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed hoover blackballed their memory look at ness
so he has no idea what's about to happen?
and?
no and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deal's done we've got a sheriff's task force on standby
what about the hotel staff obstructing us israel's obviously paid off the management
he's giving them up?
all of 'em his entire entourage i think we should move
did the justice lawyers sign off?
what about the sheriff's task force?
deputy have you made any id's?
maroon uniforms?
yeah have you been able to get through to the nomad's security?
how bad?
i've questioned him
mortal
no
yeah ye i  uh there were earlier there was that guy carrut
 agent carruthers do you know where is he now?
he uh  he asked about  i'm  he wanted to know whic what floor security was on then i saw him get on the elevator with the other agent
did he give you his name?
yeah uh  it was spanishsomethin' garcia or diego uh 
 run both those names through the dc database call san francisco see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for 
who?
this man wearing the jacket identified himself as an federal agent?
marcus?
uh yeah
you're sure?
yeah he had the badge and everything it said "fbi" on it
and when you saw him later he was wearing one of your security jackets 
yeah
you investigating those murders out at the lake?
ww uh
yeah shit  hell you're right i'm sorry
you shot me and murdered my friends
i did we  yeah i know
yes and he denies it though at first he couldn't be sure
and threw us into the lake
and this is your car isn't it?
mmmhmm
but there were more of you?
yeah m'brothers they didn't make it
two of 'em?
thass' right  i got other brother's though so it ain't so bad
i forgive you darwin
shoot i appreciate that man
if i needed your id and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law i woulda killed you to get 'em too
but marcus denied it?
you woulda?
oh hell yeah we's just in the wrong place at the wrong time so don't feel so bad dude
damn alright then
really?
man that's great
i got it made in the shade amigo hey i'll see you up here some day don't worry
are you on a land line?
i've got concerns
about what?
about cocaine and the amount you're doing
yes
i'm not doing cocaine
 forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest  buddy nobody knows about your condition or your drug use why you lied to me knowing that i'd find out anyway i'll never know but it imperative now that i see you
that's not possible i told you
there are certain meds certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done but i'd have to administer them myself
won't work we're just gonna have to chance it man i'm sorry
no sorry comes later when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection sorry 
i'm here where's the car?
what happened?
his law firm same one that hired me israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since
so i guess you're not going
well does marcus have an alibi?
i know his location we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grapevined and the rest of the world gets hipped
yeah we've been through that
then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl reed just gave us fifty grand
 jack what am i doing? i'm standing here aren't i?  shouldn't that be enough? that i made the trip?
your attitude sucks
two security levels the one we're going in under the guise of hotel security has restricted access they're mostly there to monitor the lobby handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks  there's a thirtyfive member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift if we split up we can blend in and enter unnoticed once we're inside the hotel we'll regroup
d'you talk to'm?
what'd you say?
i said i got his machine
no what did you say on the machine?
you're ruining my life'  because you won't be normal i can't be normal
if you cooperate with the da  maybe they'll help you with your situation
he does? you're sure?
i left him a message
jesus hugo how is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze? this is zero degree of difficulty man
okay
i said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned because he sounded real concerned
about what?
i dunno cinnamon roll?
i could have it sent out
do you want me to say i did it?
i was kinda hoping yeah
do you want me to say i'm sorry?
i checked it out it's clean
i'm sorry
are you a fucking colossal idiot?
i am yeah
without peer?
answer your fucking pages i've been calling for fifteen minutes we need you up here to clean now
fifty grand gouge south shore hayseeds this is why i never play tahoe or redneck reno
we're hot and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction"
that's probably him now
y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off dig it out y'fingernails y'had us for that y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own shit as light in the ass as you are i'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life  so if you think i'mma let your lil' punkass with the dirt i've done for you in the eleventh hour sell me off like some fucking field nigger hand me up to the feds like y'last chip then you done gone straight outyourmotherfucking mind
fuck you
oh kimball now where were you? 
they're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off
i dunno what to say to you sweetheart it is what it is
baby i've been cohabitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing have stared into the face of hell these are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and i feel beaten by them i feel bloodied 
and i vibe that kiddo i do indeed but it's one'a those fait accompli things you have to 
i don't have to do shit which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until i get what i want  alright fuck it if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hardons about it  make it hugo him i don't mind he needs that regimented thing that prison provides 
 buddy it's bigger than that they want 'em all ivy beanie 
buddy they revoked the deal they pulled it
they what? what? no no why?
sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of onehundred and thirty contract murders including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents freeman heller you heard of "the turnpike murders" that was sparazza
so he's personally issued the contract on israel?
where was marcus?
a marked man gets wise and wants to come in
so the wiretaps we conducted on serna and padiche the mention of israel's heart?
on an extradition flight back to el salvador he murdered a security detachment and vanished
you think it's possible he could be involved in the israel hit?
it's the last place they'd look
here sit   please
this is him? the hitman hired to kill israel? he's a doctor?
what the hell  what is this? people died agent carruthers is dead
where's israel?
what are you doing here?
he wasn't with paul owen
my debrief 
 will be handled back in 
i can't discuss 
 you can and you will
you're finished
a paternity suit filed 1967
does he know?
sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor the son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice
so all of our intel was bogus to begin with
when did you know all this?
oh right of coursewe had wanted paul owen to come but he said he had plansi guess i had dinner with victoriathe following night
are you insane?
you realize that sparraza has had thirtysix major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? elective plastic surgery every single one 
it wasn't elective it was undertaken to save his life and it wasn't cosmetic it was reconstructive look at the date of the first procedure
yeah fiftythree
holy shit that's heller  isn't it?
the agents of that era are all dead and gone history had defaulted to fable until now you can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in dc heller's op predates the second world war that's over sixty years of intel do you know how valuable that could be? the man's a treasure trove
so you made another deal?
i wouldn't go that far
you're trying to save sparazza?
no we're trying to save heller
i'm so hungry
so you knew all this and yet y
 we needed cohesion to move forward not conjecture
while carruthers and a dozen others lie dying you debate semantics the bureau's betrayed us  the way they betrayed him
i'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place you've been fully debriefed now i want you to return to dc immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter i mean it it's closed
buzzy buzz?

what's the time frame?
gibarian
you think you're dreaming me like you dream her  understand something: i am the real gibarian  just a new incarnation
i know that i know that jeez you're like a broken record i'm trying to help you
what do you want?
you're being tricked  sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors  he's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos and he's going to create a negative neutrino field  twenty four hours a day until they're back on earth
can it work?
what i'm saying is: don't trust anyone  find yourself a weapon of some sort
i can trust rheya
you'll end up like me
you're not gibarian
no?  who am i then?
a puppet
you have to give me your word you won't come in  then i'll come out
i'm hungry
what happened to gibarian?
didn't you talk to snow?
i want to hear your version
who here could possibly care what you want?  at best you're employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction  they have no idea what's going on up here they've never even been in space and i'm supposed to listen to you?
i am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation  now: what happened to him?
the same thing that could happen to any of us
where's his body?
in the lab  with her probably
they shouldn't let people like you into space
just so you know: i'm not going back until i understand what it is  i am going to figure out what it is make it stop and then i will go home
listen do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
listen 
no  there's no behavior modification
meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
yes
that's fantastic
you killed her
you murdered her
she'll come back
no she won't
why would you let her to do that?
what am i gonna do?
it's not human kelvin  whatever it is it's not human and i am threatened by that  evolutionof thespeciesatstake threatened and i want to win  i want humans to win  so i am killing it before it kills me
you fucking bastard
it's changing characteristics  it's solidifying taking on weight
how quickly?
where's snow?  did you call him?
what's wrong?  what happened to gibarian?
he's dead
you didn't bring any chocolate did you?
what?
i can't talk just now  i'm too tired
are you married?
listen what's your name?
where's sartorius?
in his lab  he won't let you in
he'll let me in
is there anybody else here?
why who did you see?
gibarian warned me  he left me a message
who was it?
tell me  i won't think you're insane
how much sleep do you need?
how much sleep?
al
how long can you go without sleep?
that depends
was her breakfast conversation that bad?
shut up
i told you try to stay calm  you're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
personally i think it's god  at least it fits my definition
and professionally?
i'm not sure  it started with gibarian  he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door  he covered the video lens obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown  i don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there  by this time we were getting visitors too  he was desperately trying to figure it out  day and night  who was she?
my wife
she has materialized from your memory of her  what was her name?
speak up come on
rheya
it started about three months ago right after the government sold the expedition  we were ready to go home
will she come back?
probably
i wish you'd told me
what will you say?
to who?
what are you going to report back to earth?
i don't know
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project we are in little danger of being left alone for long  you'll need to do something otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you
al
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed
kelvin you awake?
what is it?
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour?
why?
is it being deliberately cruel you mean?  i don't think so
i'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
you're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you and suddenly your subconscious is an open book  we are for the first time experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own  that proves that 
 we are not sure of that  we are not sure we aren't all hallucinating
if god is beyond our comprehension and she    is here for reasons that can't be understood isn't god here?
get a goddamn job al you've got a negative attitude that's what's stopping you you've got to get your act together i'll help you
not necessarily
stop equivocating  unbelievable how you equivocate  you the atheist you're more dogmatic than any holy person i've ever seen  this is happening kelvin  wake up
consciousness is enough that's all i've saying  consciousness should be enough for anybody
we can liquidate the station  take the athena back
no
of course when we return we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth  we'll chalk it up to isolation collective derangement
i've never heard you express any desire to leave before now  why now?
well i think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here right?  certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it
but why is it doing what it's doing? given it's resources it could have done anything  presented me with your double and you with mine
perhaps it did
you re so kind mister you're kind you're a kind man i can tell
human beings can die
they come when you sleep
what happened?
why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  it's the most obvious solution: escape  she knows she can't leave here 
get out 
she knows everything  she knows who she is
she knows everything?  does she know she came once before and you put her in 
what do you want?
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan
what plan?
shhhhit's okay
just get him to stop
what do you want to do leave the station with her?
yes
kelvin she'll disintegrate  you don't believe me?  let's radio that shuttle pod you launched  better yet let's go get it  i've charted it's trajectory only take a few hours
her oxygen would have run out
who are you trying to please? yourself?  her?  which her this one or that one  can you face both?  we are in a situation that is beyond morality  so: leave with her  you'll see the transformation
into what?
you'll see her die that's all they're mortal despite what she told you  she will die  then what will you do?
i love her
what's wrong with you?  we need your help
pleasei don know what to do i'm so cold
when did this happen?
oh right away  that's why you never saw me with anyone  you should've noticed that  i miss him though i think i made a mistake
jesus
but i can't leave with you  i won't make it
oh god  i'm awake
i need to see snow
i'll go with you
don't
why?
i don't know  i can't be alone
do you know how bad you smell? the stench my god
what are they?
to calm your anxiety
we're taking a flight?
rheya
"and death shall have no dominion"
book?
poem  dylan thomas  i thought of it when i saw you on the train
not a very happy poem
you didn't look very happy
i wasn't
i can'ti can't find a shelter
and tonight?
you want to fuck her?
stop it
you behave as though you want to fuck her
rheya  not here
and i just want to know if i'm crazy or not  if what i think is happening is actually happening  or am i one of those people those women who are blind to what's going on?  who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
let's go home
you go home
i am  please come with me  i don't want to do this here
you're better when you take them
divorced
hello halberstam nice tie how the hell are you?
i know i know  but still somehow i don't feel better
what do you remember?
what do you mean?
do you remember beethoven?  the beatles?  movies books restaurants friends?
is it a planet?
not exactly  it exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe an infinite number of them in fact it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or spacetime  it was completely counterintuitive  we had to unlearn everything
is it intelligent?
intelligent beyond our comprehension
then it's god right?
it's something
how's the ransom account going marcus?
you still don't believe in god?
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man  even the limits we put on it are human limits  it can do this it can do that  it designs it creates
even a god that wasn't active that just created something and stood back and watched?
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?
as i said it is beyond our comprehension
what happened?
you were trying to break down the door  do you know why?
where've you been?
i would have these  i don't know how to describe them  visions when i was younger  maybe not visions but like these waking dream states  time would just collapse i would be inside time  i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped  freaky stuff
how old were you?
it'sit'sall right
seven eight  so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what i'm doing and i start trying to explain to her about this state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face
scared  no not scared  wary like i was something to be her guard went up  i was a threat  now i know why  she was afraid she'd be seen  that i would see her for the selfobsessed neurotic that she was i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal but that's the cycle right?  i knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on  i guess that's part of the reason why 
thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you  i loved it so much that feeling
what happened to us exactly?
why did you say those things?
i can't help feeling that i'm cheating when i take them
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
i think so
i like that too
how could she not be real?  i can smell her taste her  she does exactly what she did it's not possible
really? that's interesting  not great?
you sure say "god" a lot when we're doing it
what does snow think you should do?
sartorius wants to destroy it
well  he doesn't think it's god but for different reasons than me he's thinking: if i can figure out how to make it stop than i am smarter than it is and therefore it cannot be god
he has a point
he does have a point  that's just not the way i'd like to see it proven
you feel sorry for solaris or for me?
it's a violent response to something we haven't figured out  don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: he is ruthless  unblinking in his prejudice
do i really feel like i am?
yes  yes
oh well you know
what's wrong
you don't love me
what are you talking about?
who have you been talking to?
sartorius
i'm sure there are worse people to talk to but i don't know who they are
but we fought
yes  especially toward the end
why did she do it?
you she said i didn't love her
and how's cecilia? she's a great girl
was she right?
no  i love you
can you sleep?
i don't think do  it's not sleep; it's something else  it's all around me
you're the coward
don't debate him; he'll say anything
you don't want me
rheya
that's what you were saying  i heard what you were saying
i have these strange thoughts i don't know where they come from  i can't explain it
listen the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here
neither can i  not any of it there's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before it's a clean break in the fabric of the universe; a gap  there is nothing to do but experience it momentto moment and not let it destroy us
but that's what happened before
do you want to stay here?
do you?
what's wrong?
gibarian  he was here
you said he was dead
what's happening to us?
it's all right
please don't lie  i told you before i don't know how i came to be here whatever you think you can't say to me i need to hear you say it
yeah well you're late
i love you
that won't happen again  we're different
how could it be so cruel?  how could it torture us like this?
i'm not rheya  you've always known that
rheya 
listen: i don't care about anything but the fact that you are here  you are her you are rheya
i'm disgusting
no
you're lying  i'm not human
rheya i am not going back  i'm staying here with you
hey i'm a child of divorce give me a break  hmmm i see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello
then you'll die
don't do this  i am literally begging you not to do this  chris
you should have told me
it wouldn't have made any difference
thank you
chris i had to  i had to  i didn't think you'd react like this
neither did i
you never said you wanted one
i never said i didn't
chris 
we should've gone to dorsia i could've gotten us a table
i can't stay here
chris please  chris i'm serious i won't make it
what do i have to do to stop it?
i want you here
you're lying
you exist here  i keep telling you
that's impossible  i'm not rheya
who are you then?
i i am rheya  but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago
yes you are 
i can't take you to my place
so wasn't rothschild originally handling the fisher account? how did you get it?
did you hear what gibarian said? i'm not a human being  i'm an instrument  i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what  even if i remain passive  that's when i drank the  i was going mad  it felt like there was no body underneath my skin there was something else  an illusion  but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood  is it like yours?
yes  i told you  it was exactly like mine
is that really what you want?
i want to stop taking those pills
i wish you wouldn't
they do something to me  it's hard to think straight
i think they help
i have consciousness but i am not mortal  don't you see why i'm going crazy?
you have to remember that i love you that's all that matters 
i can't 
and cecelia how is she? where is she tonight?
it put you here  i'll admit it it acted like a god and put you here put you into my consciousness  i was asleep and it put you into my dream  i saw your mouth  and there you were  whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me it doesn't matter  the decision we make now is all that matters  stay with me
am i really her?
what are you taking?
what does it want?
i've decided that if it is god it's a sick god  its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesn't realize it  it's created a situation without a goal and i hate that  a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose  and us?  we would have to have "an arrangement"  an unspoken understanding that i am not human how can i not hate something that does that?
where did you go before?
when?
last night  you were talking to someone in the corridor
how can you be here
he won't do it
cecelia is wellyou know 
why do you say that?
we thought you'd be alone  we want to talk about
they are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons they are projections materializing from our minds based on a given individual
a recoil with no compensating mechanism
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the original the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness
followed by nonhuman manifestations
gibarian was under enormous 
snow get up here now

it was something my father always liked me to do
you're planning to speak?

well of course we'd be honored
 just saying you should think twice about it
 you know and i know that the only thing standing between a life sentence for venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial
claire
is it over?
 he killed win he enjoyed it
win made his choices claire  we all do 
you're dealing with a psychopath he gets out of jail in ten years or five or ninety days and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life

she's got to identify him
why?
"make" him?
because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals  i can't believe you're talking this way mister detective  i think she's got a lot of guts
i think  she's crazy
i'd identify him
oh i can see you've had a bad day we'll see the house another time okay?

it's not your taste
what did she say the down payment was?

i can't help it i feel like they'd do anything to keep their 
well  this'll be over soon venza's such a nut job we're bound to pick him up soon
i'd like you to switch to the day shift mike  to be home for dinner helen insists that tj be home for dinner that's why he's on the morning shift

i don't know how you did it but whatever it was keep doing it
i just sat and listened
why not patrol?  they'd do just as good a job
what about when she goes out?
but i got him  he's in jail wasn't that the point?
you apprehended him after he gave himself up 
it wasn't a bad bust  he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail
a lot of what larry says is true they just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they 
even joey venza?
he's got a good lawyer and he made a smart move  we've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in
what about when she identifies him?
they're operating on him  he's still alive
i heard a lot anything you want to deny mike?
what do you think?  any chance?  there's nothin' else i'm any good at but this

when peter was little he loved to hide  in closets under the sink he needed a secret place  but when i'd look for him he'd laugh he wanted to be found
maybe i was hiding  for years i never told ben the one important thing
he knew
some things you should say anyway
even if they're not clever
even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written
what would it mean anyway? if he didn't write it?
what if you get hurt?

they keep saying there's nothing i could've done  that's a lie  i could've done something  if only i'd paid attention to my feelings
you're not trained for that  none of us are i mean sometimes i  okay let's say you had gone back what then?  are you bulletproof?
well no
so?  the next day i'd read "peter parker murdered" and i'd feel
you'd feel what?
listen  you think you're responsible for everything that happens  don't flagellate yourself  and don't flatter yourself either  you're not the center of the universe you're just peter
am i?  i'm not so sure  i used to be sure of a lot of things  oh different things from week to week but now i'm not sure of anything anymore
i mean if one little comment from gary is gonna upset you this much 
hello  earth to peter  are you listening?
i'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon
may's much better she'll be out soon
oh god i forgot to
ssh  i always thought she was a strong person  she is but not for the reasons i thought
peter?
hello liz
hello  so very boring  peter parker how do you feel about me this morning?
i i like you  a lot
hold it  can we stop being clever just for a moment?
what
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know
you were the last one to see thorkel  in octavius' hospital room
octavius wasn't the murderer type
but you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms
waldos
lieutenant i've triangulated recent bizarre events the bronx jersey brooklyn all rippling out from  here  the esu science center octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in spacetime drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding electromagnetism and gravity
yeah that's fascinating but i'm just a fat dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer
toxic dumps huh
and he'll need a cyclotron  he can't use ours he's already destroyed it  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard  new haven long island two in cambridge
you sure about all this?
teddy was killed last night
of course
it's a lot of ground to cover we'll try  funny coincidence huh?
no such thing as coincidence  "god does not play dice with the universe"
einstein right?  we'll see ya
yeah roz
any sign of our friend?
there's nothing in there worth stealing
aunt may you're trespassing
when i moved out you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle
i am old enough to
what're you  what?
but i didn't feel like getting to know your roaches
i'll introduce you
ick  and those foul chemicals in the pots
i'm a photographer remember?
it's friday night
yes  do you have a date?
the record
what the hell is that?
oh not that  you promised you'd burn it
absolutely no class
are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? nelson said it was an airtight case
funny thing happened after my physics class today harry osborn
a match made in heaven
peter you're bleeding
it's fine  tell me what
oh ben gets through everything
aunt may what happened?
i was napping on the couch  there was a voice and a shot  i woke up ben was looking at me
how is he?
poison emergency
hi  i've got sort of a hypothetical question  do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
i don't know what i'm saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
is this some sort of zen thing?
i mean i suddenly have immense physical power and the ability to crawl up walls
do ya? lemme give you the number for bellevue  that's 5615151
ha  antigravitational particles
power down  i need to talk to you
proof  proof of a unified field not just theory and equations experimental proof
in this obsolete little cyclotron i'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th century  with more power i could
then the alumni reports came in fundraising is down this year
what you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish you compare yourself to einstein; your colleagues compare you to bozo the clown
you've used up your grant the electric bills alone exceed your annual salary  not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel
i can't see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
that nobel prize will just have to wait
otto i don't like thorkel any more than you do  but he has got a point
rosomoff i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents
no  no thank you  i have work
i heard about thorkel's order
all right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures but we're all we've got
creation? or its opposite?
otto we are mere mortals you must never forget your own limits
i'll repeat the experiment  i will hold the truth that's the only thing that matters
life and death matter yours everyone's  by comparison our search for truth is only a product of curiosity a game
i don't know i just know it was teddy's code all these ideas flying in from everywhere you know how he says "any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" it's like they know what every kid's doing
my god otto you have to hear me the world we know will collapse everything we have devoted our lives to all patterns all harmonies will be destroyed
truth  truth alone exists truth must be released
mr parker
peter what can i do for you?
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because uh
pretty lame for such a smart kid
fortean phenomena  anomalies in our socalled reality weirdness my boy and lots of it
caused by doc ock's experiment?
how much do you know about it?
not a lot  i saw inside of the science center  what exactly happened?
they hack into people's programs?
need any more help?
this photo you took of "spiderman" 
luck  the right place at the right time
really  i'd like to speak with him
i don't think i'll be running into him
you never know  go get some sleep
the paper my boy  a solid bplus
oh yeah  thanks
kid you were terrific  max reiss novelty acts  was that judo or something?  ah skip it  question is can you do it again?
hello uh mr reiss?  i'm i'm the guy who wrestled hulk hogan the other day  the guy in the mask?
why?
what's normal?
no
it isn't a broadcast studio it's  a surveillance post or something that's why they have the dishes on top
where'd you get the clown suit?
like it?
so they're airing this tonight?
 a couple a drinks at sardi's?
what?
i asked if you felt like a drink
no  no i my aunt and uncle something's wrong    i need to make a phone call
mr reiss i need a quarter
i sent for  the police  we can explain
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
you're scaring me i think we should just go
you're sure you're all right
yeah just a lung full of new jersey  lucky you showed up when you did
logic  lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270  i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a
the usual  heredity and environment  what's the deal with doc ock?
he'll try to finish his experiment
and blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  bit egotistical isn't it?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius in  his universe there's only one mind his own it must be very lonely
i listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the bhagavad gita the indian holy book "i am become shiva death the destroyer of worlds"  octavius was
bonkers
loonytunes  and yet
go where? you can't get away from people like this
do you live around here?
no but i've got this secret identity to worry about i'll swing the rest of the way
i see  well octavius won't get much further they'll catch him and put him away  sad  he might very well have the truth
spiderman be careful  he's quite mad
professor you ever fly one of these things before?
up here docky ocky
don't let him kid you cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job  all right boys we were waiting in the depot in frankfurt see? and there was an ammunition train coming through the longest ammunition train you ever saw see? so dunbar gets himself in the men's room see? fixes himself a time bomb busts open the window and just as the train moves out lays the thing in there see? so then he comes out like nothing's happened and three minutes later you can hear it  boom broke every window in frankfurt it was gorgeous
i wouldn't talk about things like that
they never caught on
what's wrong with him?
"like this?" it's gary you're talking about
how did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
you must have shot off your mouth all the way from frankfurt to here
jawohl
is you all good nazis?
jawohl
is you all little adolfs?
jawohl
maybe just a hint or so think hard
we made a deal with barrack one
any news on dunbar?
you think i don't know that?
do cagney like you did yesterday
there was that ammunition train in the depot at frankfurt see? so dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb see? then he waits until the train starts moving out see? and one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor see? so he throws it see and three minutes later  voom see?
throws what? how could he have a time bomb?
just pulled the old match gag see
what's the match gag?
where's hoffy? why don't we get any news about dunbar?
don't worry he'll be all right
i had to be the ham i had to shoot off my mouth
they ought to be under the barbed wire soon
come on
milo why would he 
ready?
roger
three's a crowd especially if you've got to cut your way through barbed wire  here's the wire cutters  are the civilian clothes ready?
coming up
wwwill that do or do you want some mmm ?
there's only one pair left
what's the matter? you on their team now? you think i'm the guy?
i understand how you feel cookie it's sort of rough  one american squealing on other americans then again cookie  maybe that stoolie's not an american at all maybe he's a german the krauts planted in this barracks they do this type of thing just put an agent in with us  a trained specialist lots of loose information floating around a prison camp not just whether somebody wants to escape but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed and how our radar operates could be couldn't it?
in this barracks?
why not? just one of the boys sharing our bunks eating our chow right in amongst the ones that beat me up except that he beat hardest
how should i know? "solving a problem" i guess or needing to control everything i don't know  i've gotta get in there
who is it?
that's not the point cookie the point is what do you do with him? you tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else like stalag sixteen or fifteen or you kill him off and the krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks every one of us so what do you do?
if you don't want to tell me why don't you tell hoffy? or security?
so long cookie the department store is all yours what's left of it
now what kind of a crack is that?
hold it sefton so we heard some shots  so who says they didn't get away?
private property bub
come on trader horn let's hear it: what'd you give the krauts for that egg?
nice guy the krauts shoot manfredi and johnson last night and today he's out trading with them
what's your beef boys? so i'm trading everybody here is trading only maybe i trade a little sharper so that makes me a collaborator
even if all this were true there're 20 other buildings all of them filled with computers and 
a lot sharper sefton i'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers
you would would you? listen stupe  the first week i was in this joint somebody stole my red cross package my blanket and my left shoe well i wised up since this ain't no salvation army  this is everybody for himself dog eat dog
static is right the radio's static patton's static we're static
i suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
that's right
just what makes you and them krauts so buddybuddy?
i grease the kraut guards with ten percent of the take
and maybe a little something else?
yeah what about it?  cut the horsing around we know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay off is let's get on with it
let's get on with what? what is this anyway? a kangaroo court? why don't you get a rope and do it right?
it's the only one with dishes on the roof the studio's a front that's why they keep postponing its opening  gotta get in there
you make my mouth water
what are you looking at him for?  any objections sefton?
next we're going to auction off your department store  and your stable
have a cigar
i wouldn't worry about schulz i'd worry about sefton remember me? i'm the stoolie
you ain't going to squeal this one brother
here's the knife to do it with only make sure you got the right throat
brother were we all wet about you
put me down for ten you louse
don't ask me price was elected security
milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place how could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  and how can you get in there anyway? with the cameras and the swipe cards 
come again?
break it off
how much more do we have to take from him?
how did he get over there?
the ss men are here to pick up dunbar they're taking him to berlin looks like he's finished
then we're all in on it?
you killed them huh? both of them?
such nice boys it makes me sick to 
cut out the guff schulz we're on to you you know everything that's happening in this barrack who's tipping you off?
come on schulz spill it how did you get the information? about manfredi and johnson? about the stove and the tunnel? who's giving it to you? which one of us is it?
what about back home?
i can't just walk away
that's the general idea  only it's not so general as far as i'm concerned
lieutenant dunbar? it wouldn't be james schuyler dunbar? from boston?
maybe he would we applied for officers' training together remember? they turned me down but i'm glad to see you made it of course it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it  his mother's got twenty million dollars
twentyfive
what did you expect glamor boy? the officers' club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
just a minute you made a couple of cracks before and i let them slide but i don't intend to take any more if you resent my having money start a revolution but get off my back
shut off the moaning or we'll have the dogs on us shut it off lieutenant this is orders
my legs are frozen
you'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stinkhole in exactly    one minute and twenty seconds
sefton
you can't just walk in either
what did you expect a st bernard dog?
not you
what some brandy?
yeah
who doesn't suppose we wait until we hit the waldorf astoria
it's on me
you won't get off that cheap
what are the chances busting out of here?
let's blow chauncey
i am lieutenant dunbar
they stop the construction work at six or seven the parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning even the early geeks don't get there before five
what is your number?
105353
that is correct  lieutenant dunbar i came to apologize for the accommodations ordinarily of course we never put officers up with enlisted men
i'll live
quite a transportation jam we are having outside of frankfurt they are very angry in berlin they will be even angrier on the east front waiting for that ammunition train don't you think so lieutenant?
i don't know what you're talking about colonel
of course you don't now lieutenant how would you like to join me in my quarters? i have a nice fire going
i'm okay here why bother?
no bother i'm very grateful for a little company you see i suffer from insomnia
ever try forty sleeping pills?
i know how to get in there but you've gotta help me
you have no idea how boring my life here is if it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape i wouldn't know what to do i want to thank you for keeping me company i don't drink i don't smoke i don't read i hate music that only leaves good conversation it will be a shame to lose you
i didn't do it  i didn't do it
you are being rude again
i want to sleep give me five minutes on that couch
ninethirty general von pfeffinger should be at his desk by now shall we call berlin and tell him the good news?
there will be two ss men here tomorrow to take you to berlin you will be interrogated by the general staff when you come to the part about your arrest i'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit
i want to sleep i haven't slept for three days
i didn't do it i was in the frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up
oh come now you threw a time bomb
here we have a typical barrack it houses seventyfive men every one of them has his own bunk naturally
whaddo i do?
naturally it would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk
as for the blankets you will notice they are very warm fifty percent wool
what do you do for heat in this barrack? no stove?
the men here used it for a trap door so we had to remove it temporarily
well herr inspector how did you find the camp? crowded but gemuetlich shall we say?
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar is this lieutenant dunbar?
it is
what exactly is he charged with?
whatever it is it's out of your jurisdiction this man is not a prisoner of war not any more he is a saboteur
and the way you search your prisoners it does sound rather unlikely
it's almost nine i've been so worried  what did you see in there?
all i know is he did it i am satisfied
you were saying ?
simply this after the hostilities are ended there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission if this man should be convicted without proper proof you will be held responsible colonel von scherbach
interesting
very well if you insist on details i have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb good day sir  you will forgive me for receiving you like this?
aufstehen gentlemen please you do not want to stay in bed on such a beautiful morning we are having today
say schulz 
jawohl?
sprechen sie deutsch?
jawohl
nothing
then droppen sie dead
jawohl
wisecrackers? where did he pick up his english? in a pretzel factory?
you always think i am a square i have been to america  i wrestled in milwaukee and st louis and cincinnati and i will go back the way the war is going i will be there before you
hey schulz i got a deal for you suppose you help us escape we'll go home and have everything ready for you in madison square garden for the world championship schulz the beast of bavaria versus halitosis jones

the justice department guy who came to the apartment when 
yeah? how you going to fix me up with betty grable?
how? we go to california i got a cousin that's working for the los angeles gas company that's how we get the address see? isn't that clever? i take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say 'congratulations miss grable we have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with and i'm here to present the award'
what's the award?
what d'ya think jerko you're the award
me? what if she don't want me?
if she don't want you she don't get anything
you're teasing me again
no animal
no?
easy animal easy
i came here  i had no money  i knew no one  i couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work they approached me  i could've made a lot of money  i considered it but it's not who i am  they pay me below the table at ludwig's
i remember
don't you remember animal? a chicken lays those things

that was  different
betty betty
let me do it hoffy
you want to go?
sergeant hoffman from barrack 4
yes sergeant hoffman?
as the duly elected compound chief i protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud
anything else?
yes according to the geneva convention dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial
good evening sergeants  a bit dank in here isn't it? where is the barackenfuehrer?
yes sir
where were you?  you know you can't keep anything from me
a lieutenant james dunbar?
wait a minute we have some rights here  why is this man being taken out?
look  if you don't like the way i'm handling this job 
don't worry we'll take care of it
you're wasting your time duke  outside everybody let's get it over with
not yet
cut the horseplay harry what's the matter with you guys?
it's not schulz it's that stoolie whoever he is he's sure batting a thousand
what are you going to do?
i don't know what your scheme is but it sounds crazy
look at this
maybe it's crazy but it's better than having dunbar dead
just as you say hoffy but wouldn't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up?
what about schulz?
no volunteers price i said we're all in on it
we've all done a poor job of it
i still say this is my tag any objections hoffy?
what do you say hoffy we'll hit the air raid trenches and cut out in back of barracks nine
you'd better cut out in back of the south latrine
why the south latrine?
los los dummkopf
what?
lay off schulz he's got a sickness he's krank
sometimes i think he is fooling us with that crazy business
we know we got them last year five minutes after the geneva man was gone the blankets were gone
one more thing gentlemen the kommandant told me to pick up the radio
what radio?
you must get out for your own good you must get out
stay out of it sefton
anybody call?
if i were you sefton i'd eat that egg some place else like for instance under the barrack
if you can't get the bbc how about getting guy lombardo?
why doesn't he ask us to his party he's never even met you
what's the big idea sefton? take that telescope out of here
says who?
says me
you take it out only you're going to have a riot on your hands
lay off sefton
with your mother's pull how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
what's the matter boys? is my slip showing?
i'll say it is you spilled a little borscht on it
what happened cookie? who did it?
we did it
he has thousands of employees milo 
what's it add up to you sefton?
you heard that sefton?
you'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you
okay then put a guard on me i want you to put a guard on me because if anything goes wrong out there this time you won't have a patsy right?
right
so who stays with me? maybe joey? no  not joey wouldn't you feel safer with security on the job?
two packs of cigarettes say dunbar never gets out of the compound
you starting that again?
hurry up on that trap  what are you trying to do sefton? gum up the works?
that's right or would you rather see dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like manfredi and johnson?
so you were never a prostitute?
it's for the museum he knows you're a painter if anybody should be invited 
look sefton i had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart 
how do they know?
you told them hoffy
who did?
you did
you off your rocker?
go on
what are we going to do with him?
you taking dunbar?
i told you boys i'm no escape artist but for the first time i like the odds because now i got me a decoy
milo 
what's the decoy?
price when i go i want you to give me five minutes exactly five minutes to get dunbar out of that water tank then you throw price out into the compound nice and loud he'll draw every light from every goon tower it's our only chance to cut through what do you say barracks' chief?
you could use a new one yourself

now you've done it you've given me nervous indigestion  anything else bothering you boys?
just one little thing how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
and what's that crack supposed to mean?
they're lying dead in the mud out there and i'm trying to find out how come
when the krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob

good morning schulz and how's mrs schulz? and all the little schulzes?
no use schulz you might as well come clean why don't you just tell 'em it's me because i'm really the illegitimate son of hitler and after the germans win the war you'll make me the gauleiter of zinzinnati
du lieber gott how do you look? you had a fight?
how would you like to give frau schulz a pair of silk stockings for christmas?
you should go and see the doctor maybe i can   silk stockings?
wunderbar maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife but there is a piano teacher in the village 
three hundred cigarettes what is it you want from me?
who's the guy schulz?
yeah? give me a goodbye kiss
what guy?
the one you work with who is he? how do you do it?
i do not want those cigarettes
i'll make it five hundred
you'd better talk schulz because i'm going to find out with you or without you because i won't let go for a second because they'll have to kill me to stop me so talk
talk what? i do not know anything
what's the matter with you? you want to be killed?
hey schulz  as long as you're going to move somebody in  how about a couple of those russian broads?
just get us a couple with big glockenspiels
did i interrupt something gentlemen?
what?
yeah we were just passing out guns
this is me in cincinnati
who's the other wrestler? the one with the mustache?
that is my wife
look at all that meat isn't she the bitter end
all right gentlemen we will now all go outside for a little gymnastic and take some shovels and undig the tunnel which you digged
why don't we just plug up that tunnel  with the kommandant on one end and you on the other
gentlemen tomorrow morning the geneva man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the international convention i am sure he will find we are treating you very well you must not run around in your underwear and take off the wash the kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span
we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs
my grandmother's earmuffs
milo?
from a chicken bugwit
is it all right if we smell it?
that wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
you must have been some tail gunner  go ahead cookie
have a nice time over there?
so you're stuck with me eh?
you heard him
you're not disposing of those russian broads?
tohpakcha=8a 
the captain would make a much more valuable hostage
what are you asking me?
don't we have any chopsticks?
it's working
i thought he was the chief engineer
he is
where is he now?
target their bridge
actually captain your precise target area was thirtyfive meters that way
tomorrow i want to make a trielliptical jump that's where you jump out over northern china and make three complete orbits before you start reentry
captain=8a
but that wasn't so long ago it couldn't have been more than
twelve years sir
here we go
according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 391 years
data?
guinan said soran was trying to get back to the ribbon if that's true then there must be some connection with the amargosa star
the star's destruction has had numerous astrophysical effects within this sector however none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon
give me a list of those effects i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed no matter how insignificant
data are you all right?
no sir i am finding it difficult to concentrate i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory
what do you mean?
fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome it's something we all have to learn to deal with
but i did not deal with it sir i let it prevent me from helping my friend  does that make me a coward?
wanna savor this
no and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which i believe you're beginning to experience: guilt
according to our current information the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by 05 percent the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction a research project on gorik iv was halted due to increased neutrino particles ambient magnetic fields have decreased by
wait the bozemanwhy did it change course?
this is its current position
courage is an emotion too data  now can you project the course of the ribbon?
now you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
he can't go to the ribbon so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him  data is it going to pass near any mclass planets?
that's where he's going
it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa
are any of them inhabited?
it's gonna get cold
veridian iii is uninhabited but veridian iv supports a preindustrial humanoid society
population?
"lifeforms tiny little lifeforms where are the lifeforms"
commander
approximately fortyseven minutes sir
is she still angry?
no but i'd stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you i still don't know why you dropped her in the water
data you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
it has occurred to me on several occasions but i believe this may be the appropriate time
wait a minute i thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net
right wait a toast
but at the first sign of trouble i'm going to deactivate it agreed?
well?
i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response
really? what do you feel?
i get it i get it
what?
during the farpoint mission we were on the bridge and you told a joke that was the punchline
the farpoint mission? data that was seven years ago
i know i just got it  it was very funny
i don't see a control panel or an access port
'didn't mention he was going to the justice department?
data this isn't the time
data are you all right?
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays
that's it bridge we're all out
sensors show five life signs aboard the station captain
looks like you're stuck with emotions for a while how do you feel?
i am quitepreoccupied with concern about geordi
we all are data but we're going to get him back
could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters attempting to level our descent
no
can you locate them?
the ships are bearing at 310 mark 215 distance: three light years
we're within visual range of the energy distortion captain
we're within range sir
deck 15 section 21alpha
you did it kirk  damage report ensign
do you remember him?
guinan it's important that you tell me what you know we think soran's developed a weapona terrible weapon it might give him enough power to
soran doesn't care about power or weapons all he cares about is getting back to the nexus
that ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space it's a doorway it leads to another place the nexus it doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either
not like him is it? to do a thing like that without telling you you're not losing your hold on him are you?
what happened to you?
it took a long time but eventually i learned to live with it and i began to realize that my experience in the nexus had changed me  i knew things about people about events about time
your "sixth sense" i've always wondered where it came from  and what about soran?
soran may still be obsessed with getting back and if he is he'll do anything to find that doorway again
guinan what's going on? where am i?
this is the nexus?
for you this is where you wanted to be
but i never had a wife children a home like this
guinan what are you doing here? i thought you were on the enterprise
i am on the enterprise i am also here  think of me as an "echo" of the person you know a part she left behind
he'll tell me when he gets home
left behind?
when the enterpriseb beamed us off the lakul we were partially in the nexus the transporters locked on to us but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind
soran?
all of us
where is he now?
these are my childrenmy children
guinan can i leave the nexus?
why would you want to leave?
can i?
yes where would you go?
that'll be a test won't it?
i don't understand
i know exactly where i want to go and when back to that mountaintop on veridian iii before soran put out the star i have to stop him
what makes you think things will be any different this time?
you're right i'll need help  guinan will you come back with me? together we could
i'm captain john harriman i'd like to welcome you all aboard
well may we have a look around?
excuse me gentlemen if you'll take your seats
prepare to leave spacedock aft thrusters ahead one quarter port and starboard at station keeping  captain kirk i'd be honored if you would give the order to get underway
no no thank you
we don't have a tractor beam
i'm not a whore  i'm not a whore
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something
you left spacedock without a tractor beam?
what about the gravimetric distortions? they'll tear us apart
beautiful day isn't it?
this clock i gave this clock to bones
so you're telling me this is the 24thcentury and i'm dead?
not exactly as i said this is some kind of
you said history considers me dead who am i to argue with history?
you're a starfleet officer and you have a duty to
no no it's not it's better
better?
lisa's an extremely valuable member of the skywire team we've got our eyes on her you keep yours on milo
antonia?
captain of the enterprise huh?
that's right
close to retirement?
how can i argue with the captain of the enterprise? what was the name of that planet=8a veridian iii?
that's right
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
you could say that
i'll find a way to contact the enterprise you're going to be all right
did we do it? did we make a difference?
he wasn't acting?
yes  thank you
oh
i'm not going  scotty help me with this chute
what do you mean you're not going? we promised
you know scotty it amazes me
and what would that be sir?
sulu when did he find the time for a family?
their life signs are are phasing in and out of our spacetime continuum
the first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death  scotty?
but i do have a theory
don't worry milo i'm here as a friend or maybe a supplicant
i thought you might
an antimatter discharge directly ahead=8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
a photon torpedo?
aye
captain it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish
keep her together until i get back
kirk here
a remarkable piece of equipment but a little inelegant wouldn't you say?  have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little morenormal?
what's normal?
normal is what everyone else is and what you are not
right what's that mean again?
i don't want a science lecture you were on that observatory looking for trilithium why?
let's try to move beyond the usual prisonerinterrogator banter shall we? you have information and i need it  did the captain explain his orders to you? did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
no
what about guinan? what has she told you about me?
oh i forgot to tell you while you were unconscious i injected a nanoprobe into your bloodstream it's been navigating your cardiovascular system and right now i've attached it to your left ventricle  a little trick i picked up from the borg
yeah they're full of great ideas
i just stopped your heart for five seconds it felt like an eternity didn't it? did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
no i didn't know that
we learn something new about ourselves every day  now maybe i didn't make myself clear it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows
don't you think you're taking this a little too far number one?
beggar we're at a disadvantage with outpost our experts aren't as smart as theirs sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights i'm taking a shot in the dark here i can offer you 32000 a year a buick i'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do
well now that we're all aboard=8a  number one bring the ship before the wind  let's see what's out there
imagine what it was like will no engines no computers just the wind the sea and the stars to guide you
sir?
there's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart
hmm  inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector
you want me to contact starfleet?
is there a problem?
no sir
there is something else captain one of the scientists a doctor soranhas insisted on speaking with you  i told him you were busy sir but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away
it's just  i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something
understood that will be all
sir is there anything wrong?
report
a quantum implosion has occurred within the amargosa star all nuclearfusion is breaking down
maybe they're not out there
that's a pretty big margin of error
i always thought i'd have a crack at this chair one day
captain are you all right?
counselor what can i do for you?
actually i'm here to see if there's anything i can do for you
mr barton do you remember me?
i'm afraid i can't just leave it at that the commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something as ship's counselor it's my duty to
as ship's counselor it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not
well with all due respect to your betazoid senses i prefer to be alone right now
very well i suppose i could make out my weekly report to starfleet command without your input  "admiral lusby regarding the unusual behavior of jeanluc picard: i find him increasingly irritable remote and uncooperative i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to"
captain im sorry  i know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother
it's only natural to feel a heightened sense of tragedy when a child dies  but it goes deeper than that doesn't it? i can sense that rene meant a great deal to you
your family history is very important to you isn't it?
you felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line
my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
or perhaps they're on the surface
it's  milo isn't it?
doctor soran?
nothing for me  i understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me
doctor we're still conducting an investigation into the attack once we've completed our work we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory until then
the timing is very important on my experiment if it is not completed within the next twelve hours years of research will be lost
you must think i'm quite the madman
the thought had crossed my mind
i've spent eighty years looking for another way captain this is the only one  of course you could always come with me you fancy yourself an explorer here's a chance to explore something no human has ever experienced
we're all mortal soran it's one of the truths of ou existence
what if i told you i found a new truth?
the nexus
yes sir i need to talk to you
careful captain that's a fifty gigawatt forcefield i wouldn't want to see you get hurt
the royalstuds?
it looks like we're too late
these blast patterns are consistent with type iii disruptors
one of the dead romulans had a tricorder we analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium
trilithium?
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on in theory a trilithiumbased explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an antimatter weapon but they never found a way to stabilize it
have geordi and data go over with the next away team tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium
sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago
i have spoken to the klingon high council sir they identified the bird of prey as belonging to the duras sisters
i know
milo?
they have found a way to penetrate our shields
it is a class d12 bird of prey they were retired from service because of defective plasma coils
plasma coilsis there any way we can use that to our advantage?
as their cloak begins to engage their shields will drop
worf prepare a spread of photon torpedoes we'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak
aye sir
status
all automates ready and functioning automatic moorings retracted all speeds available through transwarp drive
enterprise maintaining full impulse power
and we are gaining stand by tractor beam
yeah hi thank you for seeing me
tractor beam aye
transwarp at your command sir
steady steady boys keep scanning  i thought you people were reliable where the hell is he
he has been here for some time i can feel his presence
don't give me your klingon mumbo jumbo  there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant
put me on the hailing frequency
what's going on? when do we get paid off?
mr chekov  ?
an energy reading from 'c" deck  from inside mr spock's quarters
mr chekov i ordered spock's quarters sealed
what seems to be the problem? you look a little upset
will we get another ship?
shall i alert dr mccoy?
unit two this is one the kobayashi maru has set sail for the promised land acknowledge
calm yourself bones
sir commander starfleet on emergency channel he orders you to surrender this vessel
excelsior closing to 4000 meters sir
you did great bones just great
sir starfleet calling grissom again a warning about us
response?
nothing as before
milo?
what's grissom up to? will they join us or fire on us?  chekov break radio  silence send my compliments to captain esteban
admiral there is no response from the grissom on any channel
still no response sir
i'd swear something was there sir but i might have imagined it
what did you see chekov?
for an instant a scout class vessel
nothing on my scanner sir
sir the shields non responsive
aye sir coding now
do you wish to advise starfleet sir?
my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
sir something's jamming our transmission an energy surge
locate
surge from astern sir aft quarter
could it be spock's?
it has to be gravitational fields were in flux it must have soft landed
i don't believe it
why don't we beam it up?
oh no you don't regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated" can you guarantee that?
all right  get your gear i'll put you down next time around
hello sir it's david
my goodness
david sorry i'm late
it's okay  i should have known you'd come saavik's right: this planet is unstable it's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours
david what went wrong?
david i don't understand
this is where the fun begins saavik
like your father so human  all units functional recorders are on scanning sector one foliage in fully developed state of growth temperature twenty two point two celsius
sector two indicating desert terrain minimal vegetation temperature thirtynine point four
sector three subtropical vegetation temperature   temperature decreasing rapidly 
it's snow snow in the same sector fantastic
 fascinating
it was racially motivated he's chinese he was and i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that don't they?
all the varieties of land and weather known to earth within a few hours walk
you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created
same sector metallic mass
underground deposit?
negative on surface a manufactured object
approximately two meters long cylindrical in form
new orbit commencing coming up on sector three
short range scan
as before metallic mass verifying triminium photon tube no new data
check for trace radiation infrared enhancement
if there's a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
there <u>shouldn't</u> be any only plant forms were built into the genesis matrix
captain please  we'll take the risk we've <u>got</u> to find out what it is
saavik to grissom request computer study of soil samples for geological aging
i'll handle that later
my readings indicate great instability
           spock's tube
well there's your life form reading these were microbes on the tube's surface we shot them here from enterprise  they were fruitful and multiplied
what is it?
later let's go
saavik my god what happened to them?
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice they're neonazis
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack
you mean we're stranded down here?
logic indicates that is the case
how can you be logical at a time like this? we have to get thee hell off this planet
that may be difficult
why don't you just call for <u>help</u>
it's time for total truth between us  this planet is not what you intended or hoped for is it?
not exactly
why?
i used protomatter in the genesis matrix
let me look into it see what's being done frankly it's not my area
protomatter an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable
it was the only way to solve certain problems 
did your collaborator know?
my mother knew nothing about it that's why i asked her to leave genesis in my hands
so like your father you changed the rules
if i hadn't it might have been years  or never
this planet is aging in surges
the genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet but at the rate things are going now
 how long?
days maybe hours protomatter has made the situation unpredictable  i'm sorry
you don't know  i'm sorry  i was desperate  that's not me  i shot a cop  can you imagine what they'll do to me when i got to prison?
'just didn't know who else to talk to
it will be hardest on spock soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood
i don't understand
pon farr vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life
whoever they are they're getting closer
i'll go
if equipment is functioning properly indications are  an animal life form
captain the logical alternative is obvious beaming down to the surface is permitted
grissom to landing party we have you approaching radioactive indications do you concur?
affirmative captain our readings are well below danger level
very well exercise caution lieutenant this landing is captain's discretion and i'm the one who's out on a limb
and outpost? you're happy there?
captain this is saavik we have strong life sign readings bearing zeroonefive relative and we are proceeding to investigate
we concur saavik and saavik be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet i'm getting nervous
captain this is saavik come in please
ah saavik that's ah extroadinary what would you ah like to do next?
request permission to beam aboard immediately
saavik does dr marcus think there could be  any chance of  ah  radioactive contamination?
none that i can detect sir
i'm sure starfleet would approve sir
captain what's happening?
i'm almost done sir you'll be fully automated by the time we dock
you're living here?
your timing is excellent mr scott you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home how much refit time till we can take her out again?
eight weeks sir  but you don't have eight weeks so i'll do it for ya in two
mr scott have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
certainly sir how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
mr scott
i'm sorry sir but as far as i'm concerned there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have
as promised she's all yours sir all systems automated and ready a chimpanzee and two trainees could run her
mr scott?
i'd be grateful admiral if you'd give the word
steady steady all right mr scott
'thought if i relocated it could help my case i'm writing programs for the local public access station where any whackjob with 100 bucks gets his own show? god does it suck  can you help me?
sir?
aye sir she's got her second wind now
mr scott all power to the weapons systems 
mr scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready sight on the center of the mass
good shooting scotty
aye those two hits should stop a horse let alone a bird
i'm all right  stand by to return fire mr scott transfer power to the phaser banks 
oh god sir i dinna think so
what's wrong?
how many more?
well i parked illegally see y'later?
just him sir
admiral this is lieutenant saavik
saavik is david with you?
yes he is and someone else vulcan scientist of your acquaintance
this vulcan  is he alive?
what happened?
is there <u>anything</u> we can do?
the genesis planet is gone
yes admiral but that may not be possible
what? what are you saying?
this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software you'd be my partner
the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought  not in his body
but we have spock alive that's more than we bargained for
or less what you describe is called fal tor pan  the refusion it is very dangerous the elders may not choose to attempt it
and if they don't? what will happen to spock?
my god
i know you do i not?
yes and i know you
my father says you have been my friend you came back for me
you would have done the same for me
why would you do this?
you can't preempt yoga that's our biggest show
yes yes spock
the ship out of danger?
on course admiral estimating spacedock in two point one hours
 admiral what's going to happen to enterprise?
the word sir?
the word is no  i am therefore going anyway
count on our help sir
 we have cleared spacedoors
warp speed mr sulu
excelsior the great experiment is adrift in space
will i get to work for outpost?
estimating genesis 29 hours present speed
we are secured from warp speed now entering genesis sector of mutara quadrant
see that shimmering area
that distortion is closing rapidly opinion sulu?
i think it's an energy form sir
yes enough energy to hide a ship wouldn't you say?
 a cloaking device?
klingon bird of prey sir she's arming torpedoes
mr sulu what is the crew complement of a bird of prey?
about a dozen officers and men
no but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this we're gonna bring down outpost
sir planet core readings unstable changing rapidly
what about surface life signs?
close there 
if i read this right sir we have full power
we are clear and free to navigate
the planet vulcan in hailing distance sir
mr sulu you're on manual
uhura any response from starfleet on our project genesis inquiries?
no sir no response
standby automatic approach system  advise approach control
what?
would you look at that?
how is doctor mccoy sir?
gentlemen good evening
good evening commander everything ready?
will you be able to handle that?
welcome aboard admiral
where's doctor mccoy?
indisposed sir
admiral i don't understand the enterprise 
jim the enterprise is twenty years old we think her day is over
they're not gonna send you right back
okay
but we had requested  we were hoping to take her back to genesis
genesis? whatever for?
why  a natural desire to help finish the work we began
that's out of the question no one is going to genesis
may i ask why?
jim you are my best officer and if i had a best friend you'd be that too but i am commander starfleet so i don't break rules
don't quote rules harry we're talking about loyalty and sacrifice one man who died for us another who has deep emotional damage 
now wait a minute this business about spock  and mccoy honestly i have never understood vulcan mysticism  i'm sorry but part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself understand?
harry you don't have to believe i'm not even sure i believe but if there's even a chance that spock has an eternal soul  then that is my responsibility
yours?
great great we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door 
as surely as if it were my own  harry give me back the enterprise with scotty's help
no jim enterprise would never stand the pounding
then i'll find a ship  i'll hire a ship
out of the question the council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to genesis
yes i hear you  i just had to try
of course now take my suggestion enjoy your leave  and let all this tension blow away
you're right  thanks for the drink
i say again: grissom this is enterprise admiral kirk calling captain esteban or lieutenant saavik come in

do not lecture me about treaty violations the federation in creating an ultimate weapon has become a gang of intergalactic criminals it is not i who will surrender it is you  on the planet below i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon if you do not surrender immediately i will execute them one at a time as enemies of galactic peace
what?
who is this? how dare you 
david? david
admiral your young friend is mistaken i meant what i said and now to show my intentions are sincere i am going to kill one of the prisoners
wait give me a chance 
there are two more prisoners admiral do you want them killed too?  surrender your vessel
commander klingon vessel stand by to board this ship on my next signal
no tricks kirk you have one minute
maltz prisoners are at beam coordinates standby
you should take the vulcan too
no
you're interfaced with our dish
but why?
genesis i want it
beam the vulcan up  and we talk
give me what i want  and i'll consider it
you fool  look around you this planet is destroying itself
yes exhilarating isn't it
if we don't help each other we'll all die here
give me your hand and we both live

ambassador i  i had no idea you were here  i think you know my crew
is it your software?
sarek i would have come to vulcan to express my deepest sympathies
spare me your human platitudes kirk i have been to your government i have seen the genesis information and your own report
then you know how bravely your son met his death
"met his death"?  how could you his friend have assumed that? why did you leave him on genesis spock trusted you  and you denied him his future
i  saw no future 
you missed the point then and now only his body was "in death" kirk and you were the last one to be with him
yes i was
then you must know that you should have come with him to vulcan
but  why?
because he asked you to he entrusted you with his very essence  with everything was not of the body he asked you to bring him to us  and to bring that which he gave you: his katra his living spirit
what?
sir your son meant more to me than you can know i'd have given my life if it would have saved his you must believe me when i tell you that he made no request of me
he would not have spoken of it openly
then how 
kirk i must have your thoughts may i join your mind?
 he spoke of your friendship
yes
he asked you not to grieve
 yes
 the needs of the many outweigh
 the needs of the few
when did you know?
 or the one
 spock
i have been and always shall be your friend live long and prosper
 no ` kirk bathed with sweat suddenly shudders in pain sarek opens his eyes removes his hands he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers opens his eyes
forgive me it is not here i assumed he had mindmelded with you it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near
but he couldn't touch me we were separated
please wait surely he would have found a way if there was so much at stake  spock would have found a way
yes but  how?
bones
one alive one not yet both in pain
that's gotta kill him right?
what must i do?
you must bring them to mount selaya  on vulcan only there is the passage possible only there can both find peace
what you ask is difficult
what about spock?
i am not sure only time will answer  kirk i thank you what you have done is 
what i have done i had to do
but at what cost? your ship your son
so  speak
share this with no one
understood my lord
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
we are going to this "planet" even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the federation we will <u>act</u> for the preservation of our race we will seize the secret of this weapon the secret of ultimate power
success my lord
sir may i suggest 
say the wrong thing torg and i will kill you too
i ordered no interruptions
we are cloaked enemy closing on impulse power range 5000 kellicams
why haven't they finished us? they outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful yet they sit there
perhaps they wish to take you prisoner
how can you tell that?
i give two minutes for you and your gallant crew  take every last man: form a boarding party armed heavily
conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites they'll pay him a huge premium to get online
they outnumber us my lord 
i'll be in my quarters execute course to the federation boundary
range: 3000 kellicams
firing range sir
1000 kellicams closing
500 kellicams
my lord enemy commander wishes a truce to confer
my lord what are your orders?
i underestimated him he did the one thing i didn't anticipate  he destroyed himself
sir may i 
are you alright?
that'd change with a criminal indictment
killing his son was <u>stupid</u> it made kirk willing to die
we still have the prisoners sir perhaps their information 
they are useless it was kirk i needed and i let him slip away
but surely our mission has not failed  ?
you amaze me commander
how is that?
a twenty year space veteran yet you ask for the worst duty station in town i mean look at this place: the hind end of space
peace and quiet appeals to me lieutenant
well maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down but me: i need some challenge in my life some adventure even just a surprise or two
commander these are some of the most famous people in starfleet admiral kirk my god
there's no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished
good for you lieutenant
but it's damn irregular no destination orders no encoded id
all true
well  what are we going to do about it?
i am going to do nothing about it <u>you</u> are going to sit in the closet
the <u>closet</u>? have you lost all sense of reality?
but dear lord are we intelligent enough to  suppose this thing were used where life already exists?
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix 
it's new  have you any idea what you're saying?
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications doctor as a matter of cosmic history it has always been easier to destroy than to create 
isn't there a stigma? bankrolling this guy?
not anymore now you can do both at the same time according to myth the earth was created in six days watch out: here comes genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes 
i don't dispute that in the wrong hands 
are you out of your vulcan mind? no human can tolerate the radiation loose in there
but as you are so fond of observing doctor i'm not human
you're not going in there  
physician heal thyself
that's all you have to say?
wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
bless me doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
romulan ale bones you know this stuff is illegal 
stigma? larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
i only use it for medicinal purposes don't be a pring
twentytwo eightythree
i'm almost afraid to what did you bring me contraband klingon 
cheers bones these are charming
four hundred years old you don't find many with the lens still intact
uh  what are they?
for your eyes for most patients of your age i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens
but i'm allergic to retlax
slide them down your nose now look at me over the top and you read printed matter through the bottom
amazing i don't know what to say 
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away? they're calling him the digital robin hood
say thank you
damn it jim what the hell's the matter? other people have birthdays why're we treating yours like a funeral?
bones i don't want to be lectured
what do you want? damn it why isn't there a girl here? you know this has nothing to do with age this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies
spare me your notions of poetry please we all have our assigned duties and
bull you're hiding  hiding behind the rules and regulations 
and who am i hiding from?
don't mince words bones; tell me what you really think
shore leave admiral
what about the rest of the inspection admiral?
milo surprised he's not your guest
it never rains but when it pours 
i've got the sick bay ready will someone please tell me what is going on?
doctors lose patients sometimes damn i'm <u>still</u> in the dark: how'd he know about genesis?
at the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it you said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would rearrange the universe
there may still be time you gave as good as you got
khan could be down there
he's been there and hasn't found what he wants can you spare someone? there may be people hurt
they even killed the galley chief
go? <u>where</u> are we going?
but what if they went  nowhere?
we tried
do you have anything to eat? i don't know about anyone else but i'm starved
how can you think of food at a time like this?
now that's what i call a meal
lieutenant you are looking at the only starfleet cadet who ever beat the nowin scenario 
until now
hours instead of days saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours 
you okay jim? how do you feel?
 come in please this is reliant calling regula i repeat this is uss reliant 
commander we are receiving this is regula i go ahead
dr marcus good we're en route to you and should be there in three days
milo? i'm danny
en route? why? we weren't expecting you for another three months has something happened?  <u>has something happened</u>? do you read us?
i still don't under 
<u>will you please be quiet</u>  commander chekov this is completely irregular who gave the order you are quoting? who gave the order?
the order comes from starfleet command dr marcus direct from the general staff
but genesis is a civilian project under my control 
this is completely improper commander chekov i have no intention of allowing reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials
jim read me? can you read me?
message breaking up carol what's wrong? what's wrong?
 can't read you repeat
repeat what's wrong? what's wrong?
'couldn't convince teddy to come?
 taking genesis away from us
taking genesis? who? who is taking genesis?
 see you but can't hear did you order?
what order? who's taking genesis?
 please help us jim won't let them have without proper repeat on whose authority
carol
wait 
david was right wasn't he? it's just to keep them busy
why? why didn't you tell me?
you did this  in a day?
he's pretty tight with his family
it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known
is that a poem?
how can you let them pull that stuff on you? they're just lazy
and bored i know but maybe it is something they can
come on mother that's just the military mentality never put off tomorrow what you can put off today if there's one atom of life
well don't have kittens genesis is going to work they'll remember  you in a wreath with newton einstein surak
thanks a lot no respect from my offspring 
par for the course you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
maybe
does that about do it?
can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
i still can't believe eddie's gone
we could move 'em up here
i don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks next time we'll design a bigger one
will you please be quiet we must have order here  this has to be some sort of mistake
i've tried to warn you scientists are always pawns of the military 
david 
jim 
go back i'm going to kill him
so are we it looks like
this? it took the starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this what we did in there  we did in a day david why don't you show dr mccoy and the lieutenant our idea of food
david please
don't tell me you've got something
who's that?
we've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner
damn are you sure? maybe the scanner's out of adjustment 
i suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix
all right let's get on the commpic to doctor marcus maybe it's something we can transplant
are you sure these are the coordinates?
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi 
you're crazy  
i saw it  
i told you i told you i saw a 
<u>botany bay</u>  oh no
hello?
but the child 
a criminal captain  a product of the late 20th century genetic engineering 
he left us  we were no longer of use saavik where is  the reliant crew? dead?
you lie on ceti alpha v there was life a fair chance to 
<u>this is ceti alpha v</u> ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here the shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste <u>admiral</u> kirk never bothered to check on our progress it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive on earth two hundred years ago i was a prince with power over millions  now like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails
captain kirk was your host you repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him
khan listen to me captain kirk was only doing his duty you 
beyond what i told you sir it is classified information
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information?
i would think so sir he's on the fleet general staff
milo? gary boyd i'm hoping you and your friend can come up here we've made some amazing strides in digital convergence i'd love to show them to you
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis?
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
well done commander
i'm admiral kirk
where's dr marcus 
why didn't you tell me?
it's a long story
it's the genesis wave
what?
he's on a build up to detonation
cool
how soon 
we encoded four minutes 
we'll beam aboard and stop it 
i don't mean to intrude
uh no  i should be on the bridge
i suppose i was  i poured a drink would you like it?
no i  i guess i'm not what you expected
i didn't expect anything
that makes two of us  lieutenant saavik was right: you never have faced death 
not like this  no i haven't faced death i cheated death i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity i know nothing
would you like a coke or something?
you knew enough to tell saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life 
it was just words
but good words that's where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them
i'm trying david
so am i my friends were killed too
i was wrong about you and <u>i'm</u> sorry
is that what you came here to say?
let go  he can't  
what are you looking at?
the admiral's son
you know a lot about art i guess
don't you believe it
what are <u>you</u> looking at?
steady on course all systems normal
they're requesting visual communications sir
let them eat static
they're still running with shields down
careful: not all at once <u>the</u> <u>engine room</u> lock on target and prepare to fire
sir  our shields are dropping
they won't 
at them at them fire fire why can't you?
i've only shown this to three other people i bought 200 we've launched 12 so far i keep the coordinates in this room  it's left over from sdi reagan's star wars technology? they orbit 426 miles up
we can't fire sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive we must withdraw
no
well?
departing dark side regula
we'll lose them if they go in there
no sir we have genesis  whatever you want 
tactical
inoperative
yours is the superior
you still remember admiral i cannot help but be touched of course i remember you
low enough to relay internet traffic
what is the meaning of this attack? where is the crew of the reliant?
 but i wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: i khan noonian singh the eagle you attempted to cage forever
khan listen to me  if its me you want i'll have myself beamed aboard all i ask is that you spare my crew
genesis what's that?
don't play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control 
give me some time to recall the data on our computers 
thirty seconds
khan how do i know you'll keep your word?
i've given you no word to keep admiral in my judgment you simply have no alternative
time's up admiral
among other things we know convergence is the real superhighway: all the pc's tv's phones etc linked together why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
kirk kirk you are still alive  my old friend
still 'old friend' you've managed to kill just about everyone else but like a poor marksman you keep missing the target
goodbye admiral oh and don't count on enterprise she can't move my next act will be to blow her out of the heavens
i don't know you but you i never forget a face mister chekov isn't it?  i never thought to see your face again
you are in a position to demand nothing sir i on the other hand am in a position to grant nothing what you see is all that remains of the ship's company and the crew of the <u>botany bay</u> marooned here fifteen years ago by captain james t kirk
listen to me  you men and women 
save your strength captain these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born do you mean he   never told you the tale? to amuse you captain? never told you how the <u>enterprise</u> picked up the <u>botany bay</u> lost in space from the year 1996 myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
i've never even met admiral kirk 
captain we're waiting what's the delay?
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
is he your boyfriend?
the content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms really omniplatforms including whatever new hardware emerges
an emergency situation has arisen by order of starfleet command as of now 1800 hours i am assuming command of this vessel duty officer so note in the ship's log plot a new course: for space laboratory regula i  mr scott?
aye sir
we'll be going to warp speed 
scotty  what's left?
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes 
we don't have minutes can you give me phaser power?
just barely sir
i'll need ten minutes sir 'til the radiation dissipates
uhura can't you augment?
she's not responding
it needs a more objectoriented language this doesn't scale does it?
try the emergency channels
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
i'm getting a voice message wait  short range band they say their chambers coil is shorting their comm system
mr scott on discrete
on screen
admiral 
 no response sir
saavik for god's sake tell her we're all right
enterprise to reliant: you are ordered to surrender your vessel respond  nothing sir
mr scott you old space dog you're well?
when you get to a certain age you start wondering about your legacy i doubt you even remember outpost 10 
i had me a wee bout  but dr mccoy pulled me through
midshipman you're a tiger
my sister's youngest admiral crazy to get to space
every young boy's fancy i seem to remember it myself  very well mr scott are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
give the word admiral
mr scott the word is given
<u>why</u>?
the energizer's bypassed like a christmas tree  so don't give me too many bumps
admiral i've got to take the mains off the line the energizer's shaken loose and i can't get in there to fix her  radiation 
no sir you'll flood the whole compartment
i do
if he hadn't we'd be space by now
yes spock
engine room reports auxiliary power restored we can proceed at impulse power
kirk to enterprise damage report spock?
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
meaning you can't even beam us back?
spock this is kirk it's two hours are you about ready?
and who is this?
your first training voyage mr preston?
yes sir
no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself
i believe you'll find everything shipshape admiral
oh do you? have you any idea midshipman preston how many times i've had to listen to mr scott on the comm telling me his troubles? have you any idea the ribbing i've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap?
is the word given?
the word is given: warp speed
i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets
they destroyed the simulator room and you with it
the <u>kobayshi maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment  as i recall you took the test three times yourself your final solution was shall we say unique?
it had the virtue of never having been tried
she's half romulan jim the admixture makes her more volatile than  me for example
i know of your fondness for antiques
'think i should buy some originals?
'it was the best of times it was the worst of times' message spock?
hrummm and where are you off to now?
the enterprise i must check in before your inspection and you?
permission to come aboard captain?
welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you
there's a first time for everything admiral
something may be wrong at regula i we've been ordered to investigate
regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves
i told starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant spock: those cadets of yours  how good are they? how will they respond under real pressure?
like all living beings admiral each according to his gifts the ship is yours
do i?
that won't be necessary: just take me to regula i
excuse my presumption but i do not agree as a teacher on a training mission i am content to command a starship if we are to go on actual duty it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command
but it may be nothing; garbled communications why don't you
you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions
i was going to remind you of nothing least of all that which you know well  your mistake if i may be so bold was promotion commanding a starship is your first best destiny anything else is a waste of material
i would not presume to debate you
that is wise in any case were i to invoke logic logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
will you accompany me to the bridge?
there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond
how far?
somebody said i'm just another philistine with reproductions
twelve hours and fortythree minutes present speed
give up genesis she said what in god's name does that mean? give it up to whom?
carol marcus 
it literally is genesis
the power of creation 
have they proceeded with their experiments?
gentlemen this isn't 
what's she doing here?
is it possible their comm system has failed  ?
their coil emissions are normal wait: their shields are going up they're locking phasers  
that's insane you're ahead of your time
they knew just where to hit us
who? who knew just where to hit us? and <u>why</u>?
one thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual  mr sulu divert everything to the phasers 
not enough against their shields
admiral you can't give him genesis
the prefix code?
you've got to learn why things work on a starship  it's coming through now khan
let's hope he hasn't changed the combination he's quite intelligent
scanners and sensors still inoperative there's no way to tell what's  inside the station
could work with a new switch there may be a few more things hidden
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
affirmative admiral
 blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond?
regula is class "d' it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
all right join the party mr spock the ship is yours
aye sir 
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with mr scott
what is working around here?
ludwig?  he's gay  are you jealous?
how's it going?
not much admiral we have partial main power
that's it?
uh oh
she can outrun us and outgun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four
i think we can guarantee she'll follow us mr saavik remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego
estimating nebula penetration in two minutes reliant is closing
admiral they're reducing speed
sporadic energy readings port side aft could be an impulse turn
he won't break off now if he followed me this far he'll be back but from where?
spock
maybe i'm going too fast
the ship  out of danger?
 the good of the few
i never took the <u>kobayashi maru</u> test  until now what do you think of my solution?
spock
kirk here
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral dr carol marcus
in my quarters uhura
uhura what's happening? damn it
transmission jammed at the source sir
captain spock if you do not hear from us within <u>one hour</u> your orders are to restore what power you can take the enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range
it's okay really
sir  we won't leave you behind
any suggestions admiral?
well mr saavik are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
permission to speak candidly sir?
very well
i don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not?
because there was no way to win
a nowin situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you?
 no sir it has not
you did this  overnight?
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life wouldn't you say?
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently?
may i speak sir?
lieutenant selfexpression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you're bothered by your performance on the <u>kobayashi maru</u>
i failed to resolve the situation
milo what's up?
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
may i ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
that was a little joke
humor that is a difficult concept  it is not logical
yes
this is damned peculiar  yellow alert
khan
reliant's command
on screen
begging the admiral's pardon: general order 15: 'no  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort'
well  you sent for me
indeterminate life signs
that's true admiral all the memory cells have been emptied
it doesn't make sense these coordinates are well within regula  a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless
if stage two was completed it was underground  she said it was going to be underground
admiral?
what's on your mind lieutenant?
are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now lieutenant?
how?
i reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship
<u>what</u>?
you really wrote this just today?
i changed the conditions of the test i received a commendation for original thinking  i don't like to lose
but the damage report  we were immobilized
regulation 46a: 'if transmissions are being monitored during battle'
that was close 
hold your course look sharp
mr saavik all stop
all stop sir
cease fire look sharp
power levels quite low sir
saavik get us out best speed
what're you implying
time from my mark
two minutes ten seconds
time
three minutes thirty seconds
after you dismiss the company you will take the watch set course for ceti alpha v and we'll pick up survivors
aye sir
i'll be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
understood sir
admiral on the bridge
as you were mr saavik
everything i do is under scrutiny the questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid  i'm confused doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
yes well why don't you show him around and
i really must thank you
i am delighted; any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month you'll have your first command: uss excelsior
thank you sir i've looked forward to this for a long time
stop engines
course plotted for regula i admiral
reliant in our section this quadrant sir and slowing 
mr sulu the shields
i'm sure
i can't get power sir
mr sulu lock phasers on target and await my command
sir you did it
approaching regula and space lab regula i
admiral on the bridge 
phaser lock inoperative sir
leaving section fourteen for section fifteen
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
may i remind the captain that if a starship enters the zone 
i'm aware of my responsibilities mister
if i was your boyfriend i might be
it scales don't you think?
shields activated
we're over our heads mr sulu get us out of here
aft thrusters mr sulu
we are clear and free to navigate
prepare for warp speed
we commend the soul of our brother departed we love we commit his body to the depths of space
fire all phasers
he's not what i expected sir
what did you expect lieutenant?
he's very human
i heard what happened
very well mr saavik clear all moorings
all moorings are clear captain
lieutenant how many times have you piloted a starship out of spacedock?
take her out mr saavik
sir may i quote general order 12: 'on the approach of any vessel when communications have not been est 
lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
certainly
you lied
i do not understand the final question
you are half human the computer knows that
had you talked to him much lately?
the question is irrelevant
spock the retraining of your mind has been in the vulcan way so you may not understand feelings but as my son you have them they will surface
as you wish since you deem them of value but i cannot wait here to find them
where must you go?
to earth to offer testimony
you do this  for friendship?
i do this because i was there
spock does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
i would accept that as an axiom
then you stand here alive because of a mistake  made by your flawed feeling human friends they have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u>  you  was more important to them
just once 'guess i was worried we didn't have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
humans make illogical decisions
heard there was some excitement
how're you doing?
fine just fine
don't tell me fish stories kiddo i've known you too long
bob it's tearing me apart
i know i feel the same thing but we're between a rock and a hard place we can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance
yeah
and finally they're not human beings you know their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours 
sorry if i spoke out of turn
did you?
not at all you gave me things to think about you always do you do sound a little wrecked why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
you  sent them away without even letting me say goodbye?
professor scott i'm dr nichols plant manager i'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mixup would you believe i was never told about your visit?
well so much for the tour of our humble plant i must say professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive
back home we call him the miracle worker
he never jokes perhaps the professor could use your computer
no  no what did you have in mind?
you'd think they could at least send a ship bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite  but to come home in this klingon flea trap
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot
you sure this is such a bright idea?
talk about work? never
what do you mean?
i mean <u>him</u> back at his post like nothing happened i don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters
it'll come back to him
are you sure?  that's what i thought
bones 
bones stay here
now wait just a damn minute
you're really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket?
we've done it before
sure slingshot around the sun if you pick up enough speed you're in time warp if you don't you fry
i meant did you find other stuff to 
i prefer a dose of common sense you are proposing to head backwards in time find humpback whales then bring them forward in time drop them off  and hope they tell this probe what to do with itself
 that's the general idea
that's crazy
it doesn't look all that different
oh joy
jim you've got to let me go in there don't leave him in the hands of twentieth century medicine
what did you say she was getting?
an experimental device doctor
wake up man wake up
he's coming 'round jim
oh yeah
congratulations jim i think you've saved the earth
hi busy?
uhura is busy i am monitoring
umm well just wanted to say  nice to have your katra back in your head not mine  i mean i may have carried your soul but i sure couldn't fill your shoes
 my shoes
forget it  how 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? life death life things of that nature?
i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines
spock it's me bones i mean our experience was unique you really have gone where no man has gone before can't you tell me what it felt like?
it would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference
you're joking
you've been coming in early
a joke is a story with a humorous climax
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death?
most unusual an unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power i find it illogical that its intentions are hostile
really? you think this is its way of saying "hi there" to the people of the earth?
there are millions of other species on earth doctor only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man
specifically humpback whales
10 million years earlier humpbacks were heavily hunted by man they have been extinct since the 21st century it is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact
you just said there aren't any except on earth of the past
that is what i said doctor
angels and ministers of grace defend us
wow you must have 20000 lines of code there
you ah  you present the appearance of a man with a problem
your perception is correct doctor in order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd century i have used our journey back through time as a referent calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve
naturally  so what is your problem?
acceleration is no longer a constant
well you're gonna have to take your best shot
 best shot?
guess spock your best guess
"guessing" is not in my nature
 i don't think he understands
you're saying it is a compliment
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process  eddie recommended one
been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler and it came over me: it's in the wrong place
who are you? doctor adams was supposed to assist me
we're just  observing
what the hell do you think you're doing?
what's your degree in dentistry?
how do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma?
fundoscopic examination 
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases
a simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure
what's causing that?
captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power
the wrong place?
can you isolate the wave?
damage report
captain all systems have failed we are functioning on reserve power only
find it?
team leader this is team 2   come in please
i have the coordinates of the reactor
 it gives me a great sense of history
how long?
all right commander you wanna tell us anything?
like what?
gary hi
my name is pavel chekov i am a lt commander in starfleet united federation of planets service number 6565827b
all right let's take it from the top
the top of what?
name?
my name?
no <u>my</u> name
i do not know your name
you play games with me and you're through
okay make nice and give us the ray gun
i varn you if you don't lie on the floor i vill have to stun you
you look a little tired
go ahead stun me
operational admiral cloaking device now available in all modes of flight
i'm impressed mr chekov a lot of effort for a short voyage
we are in an enemy wessel sir i didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral
no sir and no federation wessels on assigned patrol stations
shields mr chekov
shields aye
no choice now scotty
yes sir
ah well done team 2
i'm okay it's going well
and admiral it's the enterprise
cloaking device is stable all systems normal
the mains are down sir aux power is not responding
status report admiral
mr president the probe has passed through all quadrants the starships shepard and yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized
"neutralized?" how?
we don't know it's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand
can you protect us?
to hunt a species to extinction is not logical
attempting the hell to communicate
'have a look?
they like you very much but they are not the hell your whales
i suppose they told you that?
so you were at berkeley
are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
you sure you won't change your mind?
you mean man
they are mature humpbacks weighing 45000 pounds each they wandered into san francisco bay as calves and were brought here we call them george and gracie
despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return george and gracie to the open sea
why's that?
well for one thing we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day
why did you move around so much? when you were a kid
how soon?
ohhh<u>kay</u> i don't know what this is about but i want you guys outta here right now or i call the cops
i assure you that won't be necessary we were only trying to help
back to san francisco
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies huh?
there's really very little point in my trying to explain
i buy that what about him?
he's harmless  back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley i think he did too much lds
lds?? are you dyslexic on top of everything else? come on lemme give you a lift i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases  that's why i work with whales
we don't want to be any trouble
my dad was a compulsive gambler only he didn't think he was that applied to guys who didn't have a "system" "losers" who played games of chance he could "read" people so chance had nothing to do with it no matter how deep a hole he dug himself he'd give you the whole speech and you'd better not point out the obvious  his creditors would catch up to him loan sharks or whatever he'd wake us in the middle of the night off we'd go again
thanks
memory problems too
uh huh what about you? where you from?
iowa
a landlubber come on what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? was it some kinda macho thing? if that's all i'm gonna be real disappointed i hate that macho type
can i ask <u>you</u> something?
go ahead
they're gonna hafta take their chances
what does that mean exactly? take their chances
no ma'am no dipshit
no i just went deeper into the machine preferred being the geek to having to explain lying would've been worse
all right who are you? and don't jerk me around any more i want to know how you know that
we can't tell you  please just  let me finish i can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales
then 
in fact we may be able to help  in ways that frankly you couldn't possibly imagine
or believe i'll bet
just a little joke see you later old friend
he's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
do you trust me?
implicitly
so how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
worse?
just lucky i guess
you're upset about losing the whales
 you're very perceptive
how will that be done exactly?
they'll be flown in a special 747 to alaska and released there
flown and that's the last you'll see of them?
see yes but we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them
you know i could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted
thanks cheers
if you have such a low opinion of my abilities how come we're having dinner?
no matter what happensi'm glad i met you
cause he was a liar and i hated him  "get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world" the more he mocked me the deeper i went cause if being savvy meant being like him   guess that's why i'm kind of clueless even now didn't cultivate my conniving side 'not sure i even have one
where could you take them?
hm?
my whales? where could you take them where they'd be safe?
it's not so much a matter of a place as of time
sorry the time would have to be right now
what do you mean now?
what's that?
what's what?
wanna try it from the top?
tell me when the whales are going to be released?
that's great thanks
 who are you?
don't tell me: you're from outer space
no i'm from iowa i just work in outer space
well i was close i knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later
all right the truth?
i'm all ears
that's what you think  okaytruth i'm from what on your calendar would be the late 23rd century i've been sent back in time to bring two humpback whales with me in an attempt to repopulate the species
well why didn't you say so? why all the coy disguises?
you want the details?
are you kidding? i wouldn't miss this for all the tea in china
"dear lisa i've enjoyed working with you i'd be lying if i didn't say i find you attractive but in my heart i know that alice"  you left my party to send email?
then tell me when the whales are leaving
jesus you are persistent  okay your friend was right gracie is not only pregnant she is very pregnant at noon tomorrow  in what is sure to be a media circus  the whales get shipped out
well "admiral" that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story i've ever heard
sorry that's classified  i don't really have a clue who you are you wouldn't want to show me around your space ship would you?
it wouldn't be my first choice no
so there we are
lemme tell you something i'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century if i have to i'll go to the open sea to get them but i'd just as soon take yours  better for me better for you and better for them
i bet you're a damn good poker player
think about it  but don't take too long because i'm out of time if you change your mind this is where i'll be
here in the park?
you could've handwritten it
it's true what you said
steady now we need your help
have i flipped out?  is any of this real?
it's all real look  the storage tanks for the whales
but kirk
we'll bring them up just like we brought you it's called a transporter beam
kirk they're gone
 gone?
they were taken last night i wasn't told they're in alaska by now
what kind of spaceship is this anyway?
i'm not much good at handwriting or parties
if we keep going up they'll catch us
gillian would the whales be at sea by now?
yes if you have a chart on board i can show you
all i need is the radio frequency to track them
what are you talking about? i'm coming with you
you can't our next stop is the 23rd century
what do i care? i've got nobody but those whales
i have no time to argue gillian or even tell you how much you've meant to us the <u>frequency</u>
all right the frequency is 401 megahertz
you tricked me
gary i 
oh my god we're too late
 what does that mean?
he means our chances of getting home are not very good you might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong
i belong here  suppose by some miracle you do get them through  who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales?
hey  where you going?
you're going to your ship i'm going to mine science vessel i've got 300 years of catchup learning to do
you mean this is  goodbye?
why does it have to be goodbye?
well i as they say in your century  i don't even have your phone number how will i find you?
permission to come aboard
i hope you know what you mean to me not just because of what you're doing because of who you are
permission granted
thank you admiral
jim spock jim remember?
it would be improper to refer to you as jim while you are in command admiral also i must apologize for my attire  i seem to have misplaced my uniform
spock  you're suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man?
a distinct possibility admiral the president did say the transmission was directed at the earth's oceans
where are you going?
spock?
as suspected the probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales
spock could the humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
i'm pretty close but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer you know what it's like writing software
the sounds but not the language we would be responding in gibberish
is there any other planet where this species exists?
the humpback was indigenous to earth earth of the past
that leaves us no choice we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth
that would be futile admiral the probe would neutralize us easily
but we can't turn away is there no alternative?
mr spock your computations?
in progress admiral
ready to engage computer admiral
what is our target in time?
this is good who did it?
the late 20th century
surely you can be more specific
not with this equipment i have had to program some of the variables from memory
what are the variables?
availability of fuel components; mass of the vessel through a time continuum and the probable location of humpbacks in this case the pacific basin
you've programmed that from memory?
earth but when? spock?
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century
home in on the strongest signal descend from orbit
admiral if i may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time
'startup not 50 miles from here kid's on prozac
there is a 20th century possibility
explain
if memory serves there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects by the beginning of the fusion era these reactors had been replaced but at this time we should be able to find some
but you said toxic
we could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber causing crystalline restructure theoretically
where would we find these reactors theoretically
weren't those a birthday present from dr mccoy?
well spock thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck we are in the streets of san francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales  how do you propose to solve this minor problem?
i think we'll find what we're looking for at the cetacean institute in sausalito two humpbacks called george and gracie
how do you know this?
you better get packed
what'd the girl say?
as you observed a primitive culture
yes
admiral may i ask you a question?
spock don't call me admiral don't you remember: you used to call me jim now what's your question?
your use of language has altered since our arrival it is currently laced with  shall i say  more colorful metaphors: "double dumb ass on you"  and so forth
you mean profanity that's simply the way they talk here nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word you'll find it in all the literature of the period
oh the complete works of jacqueline susan the novels of harold robbins
come on fellah  speak up
spock
yes?
hasn't affected his work though
about those colorful metaphors we discussed i don't think you should try to use them
why not?
well for one thing you haven't quite got the hang of it
i see
and another thing it is not always necessary to tell the truth
i cannot tell a lie
you don't have to lie you could exaggerate
exaggerate
you've done it before can't you remember?
the hell i can't
help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate
what else did you learn from your mind meld?
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man
they have a right to be  do you think they'll help us?
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions
it's her  from the institute if we play our cards right we may learn when those whales are really leaving
i meant 
status?
the tank will be finished by morning
that's cutting it closer than you know what about team two?
no word since beamin we can only wait for their call
gary don't worry we 
damn damnit we've been so lucky we have the two perfect whales in our hands but if we don't move quickly we'll lose them
in that event the probabilities are that our mission would fail
admiral full power is restored
admiral may i suggest that dr mccoy is correct we must help chekov
is that the logical thing to do spock?
no admiral but is the human thing to do
mr spock where the hell is the power you promised me?
mr sulu take the con i'm taking our guest down to see her whales  mr spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time reentry program?
mr scott cannot give me exact figures admiral so i will  make a <u>guess</u>
can we make breakaway speed?
okay #2
spock did braking thrusters fire?
they did admiral
spock: condition report
you got us to the right place spock now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>  mr scott come in scotty?  damn mr spock see to the safety of all hands
guidance is functional onboard computer will interface with federation memory bank
estimating planet earth one point six hours present speed
warp two three
warp nine nine point two nine point three
mr sulu we need breakaway speed
hang on sir nine point seven point eight breakaway threshold
ready for number three?
mr sulu?  mr sulu?
 aye sir?
what is our condition?
sir braking thrusters seem to have fired
aye sir descending
ready sir
maintaining impulse climb wing five by zero helm steady
advise reaching 10000 steer threeonezero
threeonezero aye
10000 msl admiral
let's go
wing to cruise configuration full impulse power
10 seconds sir
i have no control sir
sir  i've got some back pressure on manual 
let's see what she's got mr sulu
systems report  communications?
communications systems ready communications officer  ready as she'll ever be
what is it?
overlapping distress calls some from starships others
then this is what it would sound like underwater?
longitude 109 
admiral i am receiving whale songs
individual whale song getting stronger this is strange admiral the song is directly ahead it's coming from san francisco
i'll have bearing and distance for you sir
we'll stick together till we get orientated bearing to the whales?
283 degrees 152 kilometers
any luck?
nothing i should never have left him
i've found chekov sir: he's in emergency surgery right now
uhura where
bearing
wait he knows
bearing 327 range 600 nautical
admiral i have a signal closing on the whales bearing 328 degrees
estimate range ship to whales
unidentified aircraft 40000 feet msl range 30 miles bearing 010
i can't sir  nothing
mr scott how soon can we get underway?
we're ready sir i've converted the dilithium sequencer to something less primitive and admiral  i've replaced the klingon food packs they was givin' me sour stomach
scotty how long is this bay?
about 60 feet admiral
that should be enough can you enclose it to hold water?
what?
scotty we have to find some humpbacks
humpbacked  people?
whales scotty 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece
admiral  how am i going to handle all that weight?
you'll work it out scotty and remember: two of them
two?
they're giving out decrystallizing
give me a round figure mr scott
i can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this  scotty is there any way dilithium can be recrystallized?
what is it? i thought i told you never to call me 
do you have coffee?
'knows i'm altering the coordinates let's jump to #12
sorry admiral we just thought you'll like to know we're beaming them now
it's going slow sir it'll be well into tomorrow
not good enough scotty you've got to do better
i'm ready spock let's go find george and gracie
scotty: are the whale tanks secure?
stay with me sir  i need more power curve
how long scotty?
admiral there be whales here
well done mr scott how soon can we be ready for warp speed?
i'll have to reenergize
gary?
stand by sir miracle worker at work
mr scott don't make jokes we are in danger of 
full power sir
ironic when man was killing these creatures he was destroying his own future
you better get up there sir we're having some power falloff
the whales?
no power to the bay doors
the explosive override  ?
it's under water there's no way to reach it
go on ahead close the hatch
all the companies know the faculties tell 'em at the target schools
excelsior? why in god's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
admiral i'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave
thank you lt saavik
and here is a deposition i have made if it is not sufficient i will return to earth to testify
don't concern yourself saavik your leave has been granted for good and proper cause  how are you feeling?
i am well admiral
well saavik i guess this is goodbye
even as the federation negotiated a peace treaty with us kirk was secretly developing the genesis torpedo conceived by kirk's son and test detonated by the admiral himself  the result of this awesome energy was euphemistically called "the genesis planet" a secret base from which to launch the annihilation of the klingon people  we demand the extradition of kirk we demand justice
genesis was perfectly named: the creation of life not death it was the klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets
vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the federation
i think you should go
your vessel did destroy uss grissom your men did kill kirk's son do you deny these events?
we deny nothing we have the right to preserve our race
don't know anything about it? i find it difficult to believe that i've come millions of miles 
professor scott if you'll 
with pleasure
well that's different
if you'll follow me professor 
i will can my assistant come too?
doctor nichols i might have something to offer <u>you</u>
 yes?
you do?
i notice you're still working with polymers
sill? what else would i be working with?
ah what else indeed? let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18000 cubic feet of water?
that's easy: 6 inches we carry stuff that big in stock
yes i noticed now suppose  just suppose  i could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick would that be worth something to you eh?
hello? computer?
just use the keyboard
transparent aluminum?
that's the ticket laddie
hi
i know you lost all his work maybe i could come down here and 
hi huey 205 isn't it?
right on you fly?
oh here and there  i flew something similar in my academy days
all right then this is old stuff to you
father?
i will be returning to vulcan within the hour i wanted to take my leave of you
it is kind of you to make this effort
it is not an effort you are my son  besides; i am most impressed with your performance in this  crises
as i recall i opposed your enlistment in starfleet it is possible that judgment was incorrect  your associates are people of good character
they are my friends
you are naive look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years  not that i don't miss you
yes of course do you have any message for your mother?
ojichan? akira ojichaan dewa naino? koko de nani shiteru no?  
gomen nasarei hito chigai de gozaranuka na  i'm sorry my son you have mis taken me for someone else
chotto omachi nasarei namae wa nanto moosareruka na  wait my son what is your name?
sulu hikaru
ah sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira  ah then i am sure that you will have a long and happy life
we were under the impression they were being held against their will
my people have a strict policy of noninterference with other cultures in fact it's our prime directive
your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures
you have warp capability?
just thought his work should go on
i understand how you feel we just want to retrace data's movements that day
why?
i don't like to leave questions unanswered
i know what a hologram is captain the question is  why would someone want to create one of our village?
deceive us?
don't panic
there's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings it continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies you must have noticed the effects by now
clearly the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret not just from you but from my people as well  i don't intend to let them
we've always known that to survive we had to remain apart it hasn't been easy many of the young people here want to know more about the offland they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down
he was on the verge of something too he was gonna show us the next day he said "the answer's not in the box it's in the band" know what it means?
but not you
there are days
you don't live up to your reputation as an offlander picard
in defense of offlanders there are many more like me
 who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? i don't think so
the craftsmanship is extraordinary
this is a school that's a student's work  she'll be ready to become an apprentice soon then in thirty or forty years she'll take her place among the artisans
an apprentice for thirty years  we've noticed your people's mental discipline did that develop here?
more questions always the explorer if you stay long enough that'll change
will it?
it's only meaningful when you've got 40000 lines of code to back it up
you'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday stop planning for tomorrow until you find  let me ask you a question  have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
a perfect moment?
when time seemed to stop and you could almost live in that moment
seeing my home planet from space for the first time
yes exactly nothing more complicated than perception  you explore the universe we've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself full of powerful forces most people aren't aware enough of the now to ever notice them
i wish i could spare a few centuries to learn
there's one thing i don't understand  in three hundred yearsyou never learned to swim?
i wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger jeanluc picard in my experience it's unusual for
 an offlander?
when we're forced away by the terrain we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate the mountains have the highest concentrations once we're there transport will be virtually impossible
in the kitchen
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
there are caves in those mountains
jak'tahla?
right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin we can hide for days
how is it a woman like you never married? and don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"
what's the rush?
there's a cavern at the base of the next hill
you're ro'tin aren't you? there's something in the voice  would you be his friend gal'na?  i helped your mother bathe you when you were a child she still speaks of you
mother and son you arranged this?
but i have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming i plan on using them
do you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
your app kind of blew mine out of the water
there is no need for concern i am operating within normal parameters now
you're what?
my father told me i shouldn't talk to you
i understand
not everyone here agrees with him i mean you know about machines there was even a big fight about it once  do you like being a machine?
i aspire to be more than i am
i know why  so people like us won't be afraid of you any more
don't you ever get tired?
my power cells continually re charge themselves
perhaps it would surprise you to know that i have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child
we'll come up with the next big thing
really?
really
for one thing your legs are shorter than everyone else's
but they are in a constant state of growth do you find it difficult to adapt?  a child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next i am surprised that you do not trip over your own feet
sometimes i do
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you don't like
i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child
do machines ever play?
i play the violin and my chess routines are quite advanced
chase me
you wanna work  here?
for what purpose?
because you're it and if you tag me then i'm it
but i can run much faster than you i am capable of exceeding fortyseven meters per second
data haven't you ever just played for fun?
androids don't havefun
why not?
no one's ever asked me that before
anij
tournel will take you the rest of the way
no i want to stay with you
you guys'll be using teddy's old space is that okay?
i have to go home now
can he breathe under water?
data doesn't breathe
won't he rust?
to many offlanders what you have here would be more valuable than goldpressed latinum  and i'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you
the artificial lifeform was right?
captain the son'a hostages declined to be examined i had them confined to quarters
and our people?
they all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production probably the result of the environmental anomalies here
are they in any danger?
could it be a glitch? something the construction workers caused?
not at all they're fine in fact they're better than fine increased metabolism high energy improved muscle tone we should all be so lucky
you either need a new uniform or a new neck
'yewcheen cheffaw' my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy
very funny
prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship
will he live?
she's stabilizing
is it safe to move her?
hello data
captain geordi?
unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil? tell 'em there may have been a breakin?
yes that looks like them
what's the last thing you remember data
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl'
from the mission
i believe the boy is afraid of me
it's nothing personal data you have to remember these people have rejected technology and you
 i am the personification of everything they have rejected
until this week that young man probably never saw a  machine let alone one that walks and talks
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills
a ship
every entry was authorized
it is clearly federation in origin captain
incomplete i might add
 it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence
why would the federation or the son'a wish to move the ba'ku?
captain i've activated transport inhibitors around the village
how many?
i'm showing fresh air  behind this calcite formation captain
will the structure hold if we blast through?
your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk
keep looking
take us into a high orbit  lie down admiral the girls will take twenty years off your face
your selfrestraint puzzles me admiral you continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer
your android has turned dangerously violent captain considerable damage was done to my ship he must be destroyed
it isn't safe for you to remain in this area
take me down let me talk to picard
talk we should send down an assault team and take them by force
that is not an acceptable option if people get hurt all the support we have in the federation
i'll order riker to turn around
you're not going to launch anything until
we're taking this ship out of here this mission is over
what're we looking for?
it is not over
i do not take orders from you
you have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
 and now he's holding our people hostage down there
the enterprise can be at your position in two days admiral
that's probably not a good idea your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns
what kind of concerns?
captain i wasn't expecting you
this was too important for the enterprise to be on the sidelines admiral
i wish i had better news commander data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday ru'afo and i have decided to send in an assault team
i'll make some for us
delbert seems to enter #21 twice without leaving the first time
all right you have twelve hours captain then i want you out of the briar patch in the meantime we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for son'a reinforcements in case you fail
understood
 and because they have warp capabilities the consequences to their society are minimal
you've done a terrific job jean luc now pack your bags and get the hell out of there how's data?
in stasis la forge is completing the diagnostic
i'll need all your paperwork tomorrow we're heading back your way set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out
you're not finished here?
you're looking well jeanluc rested
your "briar patch" turned out to be more hospitable than i expected
that's why we put chromodynamic shields in place  so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation
get the backslash the colon keys kids don't use but geeks do  what would milo want in here anyway?
 or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world  i won't let you move them admiral i'll go to the federation council
i'm acting on orders form the federation council
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive?
the prime directive doesn't apply these people are not indigenous to this world they were never meant to be immortal we'll simply be restoring their natural evolution
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
there are six hundred people down there we'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions  the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings
a planet in federation space
right we have the planet and they have the technology  a technology we can't duplicate you know what that makes us? their partners
our partners are nothing more than petty thugs
on earth petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire we can handle the son'a i'm not worried about that
you calling phil and randy?
someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago
with metaphasics lifespans will be doubled an entire new medical science will evolve  i understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life would you take his sight away from him?
there are metaphasic particles all over the briar patch why must this planet be
the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work don't ask me to explain it i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction after it's over the planet will be unlivable for generations
delay the procedure let my people look at the technology
our best scientific minds already have we can't find any other way to do this
then the son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do
it would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition some of them won't survive that long besides they don't want to live in the middle of the briar patch who would?
we are betraying the principles upon which the federation was founded this is an attack on the very soul of the federation  this will destroy the ba'ku just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history
we are only moving six hundred people jeanluc
come with me
order them to surrender and i promise you won't be court martialed
i wonder which one of us will be facing that courtmartial
a coward without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity you offend me
is this how a federation officer begs for his life?
what you're asking me to do is impossible the crew is loyal to ru'afo
do you know how to disable the injector?
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge
if we could lure him away from the bridge
it doesn't matter where he is as soon as he realizes something is happening he'll override my commands with one word at his com link
the countdown control has been transferred to the collectori can't override
now what are we doing? i don't get any of this shit
gallatin so the righteous starfleet captain finally released you did you encounter any problems on the surface?
no sir but it wasn't easy being among them
the injector performs perfectly in every simulation
sir as the enterprise left orbit one of their support craft went down to the surface  it appeared to be the captain's yacht five persons on board
they're following the kelbonite deposits using the interference to block our transporters
there is an alternative to an all out assault isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to them
admiral dougherty will not be joining us for diner deploy the collector  do you have a problem with those orders?
may i talk to you alone?
moving them is one thing killing them all
separate the starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold see that picard joins them
lisa
the shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction
i want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows i'll ask worf to delay his return to ds9 so he can join us we're going to stop by sector fourfour one on our way to the goren system
they are in opposite directions sir
we're about to lose communications with starfleet captain
the torque sensors are out of alignment by twelve microns you could hear that?
i took these out of data's neural net they contain memory engrams
do you know how they were damaged?
by a son'a weapon  there's no doubt about it sir that's what made data malfunction
the son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned
i don't believe it happened that way
you know my name
why would they fire at him without provocation?
all i know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot then his failsafe system was activated
failsafe?
his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions
so you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong
in a sense that's all he knew the system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss
implants bothering you?
funniest thing captain there wasn't anything wrong with my implants there was something right with my eyes when doctor crusher removed the ocular connections she found the cells around my optic nerves
 had regenerated
a photon torpedo  isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
you know mine
full impulse
the manifold can't handle full impulse in the patch commander
if we don't outrun them the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship
will that stop the tear?
you got me commander
that's your expert opinion?
we're pulling it like a zipper across space
options?
aye sir highly volatilei recommend we keep our distance
negative i want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can
you're famous around here
i wouldn't be surprised if history remembers this as the riker maneuver
if it works you mean
i don't think they believe us
sir they've detonated an isolytic burst a subspace tear is forming
the tear is closing on us impact in fifteen seconds
the purpose being i intend to shove it down the son'a's throat
commander if one of their weapons hits that gas
commander i'm showing two son'a ships on an intercept course
how long 'til they reach us?
what's inside that nebula cluster?
i'm getting a teacher's pet rep
cometary debris pockets of unstable metreon gas we don't want to go in there sir
i thought subspace weapons were banned by the khitomer accord
we're still thirtysix minutes from transmission range sir
they're powering their forward weapons array
they need us to mediate some territorial dispute
we can't delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two it would put us into the middle of monsoon season
the diplomatic corps is busy with dominion negotiations
'yewcheen cheffaw'
who is it?
 and gorgonzolla cheese
like i'm supposed to know what that even means
what are you doing?
i wouldn't worry about it you've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
we won't be able to go any faster than onethird impulse in that muck
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey
so where are the 'environmental concerns' the admiral was talking about?
admiral dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet
deck five
prepare the ship for departure at ohsevenhundred hours
you must be planning on doing some hunting
there's a short letter i left you all just some sentimental nonsense the computer will bring it to your attention at oh fourhundred i'd just as soon you delete it
the council has ordered a halt to the ba'ku relocation while they conduct a toplevel review
my name is sojef captain
were you?
jeanluc picard my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi
would you like something to eat?
no we're here to rescue them
we came here from a solar system on the verge of self annihilation where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life a small group of us set off to find a new home a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds  that was three hundred and nine years ago
you've not aged a day since then?
i wish there was a way to bring them back home
ask them
bridge to captain picard we are approaching sector fourfourone
i i must have slept through my alarm i'm on my way
worf to picard
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
yes yes i can hear you
worf you must hurry
we're coming as fast as we can we can't risk using phasers
captain
i've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down
sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface
transmit a wide band covariant signal that'll get his attention
he might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach
come out come out wherever you are
sir?
me too were you an army brat or something?
sir if we fire a tachyon burst it may force him to reset his shield harmonics when he does we could beam him out
direct hit he's resetting his shield harmonics
he's activated a transport inhibitor
scanners are off line
do you know gilbert and sullivan?
no sir i haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i've been back
sir inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance if we don't release him he may destroy both vessels
the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire
did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
no sir
something like that yeah
debrief them again  have you been in a fight commander?
no sir it is a gorch
doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned
should i distribute phasers to the ba'ku sir?
you need a haircut commander
the ba'ku could use some rest sir according to the geoscan this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers
isolinear tags their transporters can lock onto them
all injector subsystems are confirmed offline
one it's ru'afo
can you beam him off?
did i say something?
negative he's established a security field around the control room
 population three hundred million
say the greeting again
oh my god are they vegetarians? that's not in here
we've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the son'a
counselor?
the son'a discovered an mclass planet with humanoid life six months ago turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study the federation council suggested it be a joint mission
why was data assigned?
i don't see anything to suggest the son'a have any interest in sociology
what are they interested in?
what've you got there?
wine women and song
nomadic collectors of precious metals jewels
hmm i should feel right at home with them
why would we be involved with these people?
you haven't done that in a long time
what?
what you're doing to my neck
it says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the son'a from procreating
no children?
come in  hi
graphical interfaces for skywire? i'm s'posed to coordinate with you
got a minute? i need a little counseling  first time for everything do i lie down or what?
this isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures
but it's comfortable
why don't you try sitting up?
or you could try lying down
both  i think i'm having a midlife crisis
 i believe you
 i'm not sleeping well
what i need i can't get from doctor crusher  counselor do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made?
augh
cool
augh?
all hands battle stations
initiate launch sequence
exactly as the simulations predicted
sir i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels
your scanners must be malfunctioning
this ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters are they all useless?
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here
the new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick jeanluc we've destroyed fortyseven borg ships so far and only lost fifteen of our own  but one of the borg ships has broken through our defenses and it's heading directly for earth can you handle it?
absolutely
did you wanna be alone?
good hunting hayes out
admiral what's the status of the borg fleet?
it's been destroyed the borg threat is over  are you all right? the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment
we're fine sir it will take some time to explain
montana  energize
go where? hello? is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
we're here to find zephram cochrane he may be injured or dead
cochrane the inventor of warp drive?
yes
but he's been dead for three hundred  oh god we've gone back in time again haven't we?
forget about me  you have enough problems of your own
they just pushed up the schedule on skywire apps how fast are you going?
i'm afraid so if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans earth will remain in the second dark age an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century
it's cochrane
it's not the radiation and there's nothing wrong with the combadges the enterprise just isn't responding
jeanluc this man needs medical attention now
what are we waiting for? let's go
it may not be that simple this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history
are you saying they won't help us?
i'm saying they might shoot us on sight you have to remember these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them
there must be some good people even in this time
he's stable for now  but it would be better if we could contact our friends
"there is no second place" plus every time i get jammedup gary has an inspiration  is it like that with your counselor?
yes but until then you'll have to make do with what you've got
i have to go back to the silo will you be all right?
you actually performed surgery?
but i had a little help surgical transporter i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain
how did doctor almack react to that?
he was so confused by what i was doing i don't think he even noticed  any word from the enterprise?
not yet
you think they're still up there?
if they're not we'd better get used to living in montana
regardless of how i may feel about ruby our fates lie along different paths nothing can change that
mine's not the ceo he barely remembers to take a shower
you want some advice? don't do this again  you know exactly what i mean
beverly there were many reasons why you and i
how long has he been unconscious?
is it japanese?
um yeah  now he's going to need a respirator do you have one?
his automatic reflexes are fluctuating we've got to get him on a respirator
the occipital fracture is widening we're going to have to fuse the bones
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg?
have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
you've taken your first step toward perfection how does it feel?
right right but does he ever just like hand you code?
i do not know what you are referring to
do you know what this is data?
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure
no i will not betray my friends
they're not your friends they've held you back kept you from your destiny
that is not true they have tried to help me
have they given you what i have given you? did they even try?
you're becoming more human all the time data now you're learning how to lie
i wish to go back to the way i was
have you ever know a woman? do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face her skin against yours flesh against flesh?
maybe once i rewrote it anyway
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things
i am grateful for what you have given me but i still do not wish to be assimilated
yes
i've deactivated the sensory inputs that flesh on your body is just meat now
isn't it better like this?
yes but the enterprise my duty
no no it's so empty please give it back i need it
there is a perimeter alert a ship has entered sensor range
vulcan?
your diagnostics are in error i need weapons
you're compulsive
the problem must lie in the interface between starfleet and borg technology your console may not be configured to handle the data flow
can you configure it?
i believe so
dispersive armor is holding
the borg ship has modified its shields captain our phasers will no longer be effective
we are approaching the terran system captain
go to impulse where's the borg ship?
it has entered earth orbit  correction  it is not in orbit it is heading directly toward the surface
i have helm control
the vortex is collapsing sir
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
what year is it?
mister data i want to know the exact date and time  give me a damage report on that missile silo
but now they are all one with the borg
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before as an android i am in complete control of my neural net the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed
who are you?
i am the borg
that is a contradiction the borg act as a collective consciousness there are no individuals
the planet's surface is covered with borg technology  so is the moon and three other planets in this solar system
did you know her?
data are you sure you're all right?
why's that?
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming grief loss remorse
no human beings do not have that luxury and neither should i
"apr cell count?" what the hell are you talking about?
juice?
where's the battery room for the hospital?
i told you there's no 
where?
what did you do to the batteries?
captain i'm starting to worry about the hull integrity we've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight i don't know how much longer it's going to hold up
i have the silo sir bearing three one zero distance three hundred meters
so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then? or now?
this must be it
how serious is the damage?
i'm having trouble scanning underground there's a lot of radiation leaking from something
i'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below
alphanumeric lock we need a password to get in
blast door it's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched
picard to enterprise  enterprise please respond
this used to be the throttle valve assembly  it controls the thrust of the engines it's been completely vaporized and without it there's no way to launch the ship
can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
yeah if i knew what it looked like there's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this
that's great i  didn't know
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours  there must be some design schematics blueprints
maybe  sure yeah as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration but so far we haven't found any other photos
where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
ready to make a little history?
always am
we can't leave her out there when the ship launches she'll be killed
tell her to go back to resurrection
captain 
captain we've got less than ten minutes before that vulcan ship leaves the system we've got to go <u>now</u>
no the door's too thick
do you really want me to forget about you?
i snuck into #21
then we'll just have to assume it's still there
what's still there?
solid rocket fuel at twentyfive thousand kilograms
altitude fifty kilometers
entering the upper ionospere
there's a red light on the second intake valve
ready to deploy the warp nacelles
the vulcans should be out there right now we need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention
bring the warp core online i'll lay in a heading
the nacelles are charged nuclear warhead standing by we're ready to ignite the warp drive
why would you do a thing like 
passing onehalf light speed the starboard nacelle's running a little hot
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating i don't think cochrane built this thing for comfort
there's no temporal shielding in here we're starting to pick up relativistic effects
captain the enterprise
their com system must still be down
they're getting awfully close what the hell are they doing?
are we on schedule? the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours
it'll be tight but we should make it
what about our warp signature? it has to be strong enough for them to detect
i've enhanced the plasma injectors  don't worry they'll see it
you thought about it too you've been suspicious for a while but it's not happening in there it's happening in the day care
atr setting
active
main bus
ready
oh  yes ultraviolet protection thank you mister?
lieutenant actually lieutenant jonathan scrimm i'm the head of the resurrection protective force  and you are?
jeanluc picard
great name french?
yes
where in the states?
it's easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell 'em they upload medical files school records pharmacy files they'd be happy just to steal code forever but when a program gets close to fruition like teddy he was almost there
oh here and there you know how it is
where are you from most recently?
california san francisco
beautiful city used to be anyway i didn't think anyone still lived there
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries how'd you do it?
it wasn't a trick i used to be an electrical engineer
and what were you doing out at the missile silo?
i'm an old friend of cochrane's i wanted to see how he was doing
lucky for him you came by when you did he might be dead now
yes
but why would they ?
maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo we heard some explosions out there this morning
you seem to have an answer for everything
something wrong with that?
what do you want?
the invasion plans
invasion
there is no invasion
from another planet  oh i almost forgot they have green blood and pointed ears
and you know all this because <u>you're</u> a spaceman too
take care of him he's a very special man
i know why you're so secretive why you won't let anybody near you  i know what he did to you
what are you an idiot? didn't you see the red light was on?
ah yes but i didn't realize that 
cochrane?
yes and i only had enough silver halide for one shot so you're lucky you didn't screw it up
did you need something?
yes i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo there were three of them printed on some kind of fabric
bed sheets  i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints not the best material but i haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years
"money" so you can get dome money
i can try
no but sometimes i feel that way  what i meant was i'd be willing to trade for the photographs
is that my  scenario?  tell me
trade okay the photographs for a straight answer  who are you? and how do you know zephram?
i'm an old friend i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in 
what?
you're lying
what makes you say that?
you're not someone who lies very easily so it's obvious when you do at least to me
were the two of you involved?
no not like you and doctor crusher used to be
ruby i need to talk to you about those photographs it's very important
i'm sure it is but it'll have to wait until tomorrow
they'd frame him
it can't wait until tomorrow
i'd say you already have
okay let's hear it i'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house
we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship it's been damaged and 
we?
myself and a few other friends of zephram's
friends from cornell
some
lie that's one keep going
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like
he's out of prison?
all right truth i believe that one why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon
why are you being so difficult? all i'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs it'll take five minutes
and all i'm asking for is the truth that would take five minutes  for all i know you caused the explosions at the silo and now you're trying to steal zephram's ship
you're leaving aren't you?
i have to
where? and don't tell me san francisco
no it's a lot further than that
it's the future isn't it? just like you told scrimm  i knew you weren't from around here
no i'm from france
milo?
i don't care if you're from france or venus just take me with you
that's impossible
why?
this may be hard for you to understand but i'm dutybound not to interfere with you or anyone else here any more than is absolutely necessary
signal the endeavor to fall back we'll cover them
incoming transmission from the borg
life signs?
captain?
track their weapons fire
port battery ready sir
i don't want to drag you down with me
hmm?
time travel they're attempting time travel  full power mister data worf quantum torpedoes at my command
captain there are five borg ships closing in on our position
hull integrity down to thirty percent
captain i've found the borg sphere it's on the far side of the planetfiring at the surface
intercept course full impulse  weapons status?
phasers are offline we have two quantum torpedoes left but the computer targeting system has been destroyed
target locked
worf have doctor crusher mister la forge and a security team meet me in transporter room three civilian clothes
incoming transmission from starfleet command admiral hayes
we're caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex
i always felt if a  boy i liked ever found out  he'd run he'd think i was unclean
they must've done it in the past they went back and changed history
report
we're still in earth orbit
looks like they damaged the silo
life signs?
captain?
in twentyfour hours zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test from a missile silo in montana if i'm right the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship
and if they succeed humans won't make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow  as first officer i should be the one beaming down
good luck sir
return to our own time?
what about the fbi?
yes sir
yes sir but captain are we all going back?
unless you'd like to stay
casualties are light captain minor buckling on the port nacelle nothing serious
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems so far they've had no success
a shipwide decompression has been initiated
what the hell is happening worf?
we saw at least thirtyand there are twentytwo enterprise crewmembers reported missing including commander data
to control the enterprise they'll have to gain access to one of two locations main engineering or the bridge
what are they doing?
they've got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person it's over
they're rerouting the deflector power conduits
they're connecting the conduits to subspace communications
we have to stop them from sending that message
agreed options?
you will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation  there's only one torpedo left
i guess i'd better get it right the first time
are you alright?
just a little queasy
try not to look at the stars keep your eyes on the ship
right
who can we trust?
and commander whatever you do do <u>not</u> vomit in your exosuit it would be unpleasant
worf i'm going to need at least five minutes
report
we've lost bridge control
emergency override
report
someone?
the borg  some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship  seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields
wil data was down there
all right we've lost control of eight decks three cargo bays one shuttlebay
do we post it on the net?
they're bypassing engineering
to do what? if they wanted a weapon they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay
i remember it made me sick
what are you suggesting?
i have to admit there was a moment there when 
worf to bridge
riker here
worf to bridge we're about to enter the environmental control room
worf? is something wrong?
what the hell happened down there worf?
the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine
no response  i'm not reading any starfleet com traffic in this entire sector
captain they're firing at a nuclear missile silo in central montana
are we in any danger of being detected by earth defense systems?
even data?
they may be trying to send a message to the other borgthe borg in this time period
mr president
admiral donaldbill
mr president we cannot allow federation citizens to be abducted
i'd prefer not to be the president to push the button if i can avoid it
the longer we wait the less accessible the hostages will be mr president
right but gary's tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
good luck captain
i believe the operation is over
i'm going to perform surgery on a torpedo  you never know
you may need assistance doctor
bet you wish you'd stood in bed
spock that was actually funny
calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete
pity they're retiring us just as i was starting to understand you spock
or not to be 
uh jim
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
what the hell's going on?
sweet jesus he's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is
can you  ?
no
thanks
figures
bones why don't you see what you can do? let them know we're not holding a grudge
three months till retirement what a way to finish
we're not finished
 <u>kobayashi maru</u>
he's buying up pretty much everything: cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives getting ready for skywire
bones are you afraid of the future?
that was the general idea i intended to convey
i didn't mean this future
are we playing multiple choice?
some people are afraid of the future; of what might happen;  i was frightened really frightened
specifically of?
no more neutral zone i was used to hating klingons that's why i failed in our assignment  it never even occurred to me to take gorkon at his word spock was right
well don't be too hard on yourself  we all felt exactly the same 
uh uh somebody felt much worse and i'm starting to understand why
what is it with you anyway?
i told your partner i can't help  i didn't see anything
what about "60 minutes"
still think we're finished?
what kind of creature is this? last night you two were spooning 
jim leave me  i'm finished
it's the viridium patch spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard gorkon's ship
that cunning little vulcan
once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away
if they're even looking for us
are you crazy?
damned clever if you ask me
absolutely not
yeah they dig stuff like this  "cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of 2001"
time we got underway ourselves gentlemen  once again we've saved civilization as we know it
and the good news is they're not going to prosecute
perhaps with a few small steps at a time like this one
we're explorers not diplomats
captain when we get to camp khitomer how will we defend ourselves? i mean if this new bird of prey can fire while she is invisible?
this is fun
too bad we can't smell her
they don't arrest people for having feelings
are you carrying a surgeon?
we were until your torpedoes
but still you can't say cbs wouldn't love to break something like 
doctor mccoy what is your current medical status?
for 27 years i have been ship's surgeon and later chief medical officer aboard the uss enterprise in three months i'm due to stand down
stand?
retire
was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him?
barely
i didn't have the knowledge of klingon anatomy i needed
i was nervous 
you were incompetent  whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine
i tried to save him i was desperate to save him he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace
time?
i don't believe we can get more out of the way than this
they'll make it look like an accident
what are you in for if you don't mind me asking?
they'll respect him now
it takes a lot of effort
i don't wonder stop me if i'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
i've always wanted to meet you captain
would you care to go topside?
"to be or not to be that is the question" which preoccupies our people captain kirk we need breathing room
my god what happened here?
how close are you?
you feign ignorance?
what happened?
he's a doctor
under article 184 of interstellar law i place you both under arrest you are charged with assassinating the chancellor of the high council
he just tried to save him
what?
isn't it a fact that you served romulan ale a beverage illegal in the federation because of its overwhelming potency?
and you still maintain your ship did not fire on kronos one? would you have known if she had? come now captain the record clearly there were no other ships in the sector
there were no other ships in the sector
did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
what?
i checked the data banks yes
and what did they tell you?
and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair captain james tiberius kirk i put it to you captain that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son
that isn't true
are those your words?
yes
spoken by you?
yes
louder please we cannot hear you
you were demoted
we can't just assume they're standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch i'd have to write in an aglet
yes
for insubordination
i have on occasion disobeyed orders
you deny enterprise fired on kronos one?
well i 
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor?
i cannot confirm or deny actions which i did not witness
captain kirk are you aware that under federation law the captain of a starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
i am
as captain i am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command
a what?
where is mr sulu?
captain you're not going to show them the bridge??
just the size of my head 
torpedo room?
captain if they fire at us with our shields down 
get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "stun" without setting off the alarm  of course you can't get rid of the body
from starfleet?
where is the conference?
she's here  somewhere
but if she's cloaked
it's how online services push logos they wanna sell you you don't ask for 'em they just appear 'have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house and then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital that's 12 months away
shields battle stations
mr chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power
mr chekov slow down take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power
course heading captain?
they're preparing to fire
you're forgetting something  the data banks say we fired if we did the killers are here; if we didn't whoever altered the data banks is here either way what we're searching for is here
what are we searching for mr spock?
klingon blood
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory
but they'd still get the idea right?
now we go to starfleet?
now we expand our search to include uniforms
mr spock rura penthe's deep in klingon territory if we're discovered
you must have cursed yourself for having programmed our data banks lieutenant only they revealed something wrong aboard enterprise
aye sir
captain i'm getting a message from klingon high command
an incident?
do we report this sir?
send to commander enterprise: "we stand ready to assist you captain sulu uss excelsior" attach our coordinates
this is kronos one i am chancellor gorkon
c'mon start at the beginning  you know these people?
you'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop maybe some audio too to tie it all in to gary how long would that take you?
chancellor we've been ordered to escort you through federation space to your meeting place on earth
thank you captain
we'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation
we'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours
chancellor may i present commander spock whom i believe you know dr leonard mccoy chief medical officer montgomery scott chief engineer
your research laboratory is most impressive
starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors
thank you captain kirk the evening has been most edifying
i've heard of chameloids  "shapeshifters"  i thought you were mythical
an accident wasn't good enough
it's a standard gui once i've got a concept it's maybe three day's work
your friends are late
isn't it about time you became something else?
what took you so long?
kill him he's the one
he wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens
he's got it
and your coat
fraid not it wouldn't fit him anyway
how did you know?
we don't get many presidential assassins
gary knows i'm close on skywire we have to do this fast
we didn't kill gorkon
how much time's left of your sentence?
that's not his knee  not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place captain
when whoever it is makes their move you won't be here to ask if he's the one
listen no one has ever escaped from rura penthe
except us
i know how to get outside the shield
where do we come in?
getting outside the shield is easy after that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze can you?
possibly
before they kill somebody else too
i can't make it alone you're the likeliest candidate to come to this godforsaken place in months
maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed
stand down your weapons
captain if 
stand down mr scott all stop that's an order
this is incredible 
as you were lieutenant?
aft thrusters 
thank you lieutenant one quarter impulse power
aye sir
oh man i'd have to get into gary's house to get the satellite positions
plot a course for kronos lieutenant
kronos sir?
i'm still in the chair lieutenant
sorry 
come on saavik you could knock 
we're almost at the rendezvous  i thought you'd want to know
i gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment i don't think many on board are
you piloted well out of spacedock lieutenant 
i always wanted to try that
uhura hailing frequencies right standard rudder bring us alongside
you mean  break in?
i hope you're happy
saavik you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
sir?
captain our shields  
who is "us?"
i won't allow starfleet to be dismantled over some klingon promises
just the prototype
this is captain sulu uss excelsior
sulu
standing by captain kirk
i don't know 
you understand that by even talking to us you're violating regulations captain
i'm sorry captain  your message is breaking up
bless you sulu  where's the peace conference? they're going to attempt another assassination
the conference is at camp khitomer near the romulan border i'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency
i'm afraid we may need more than that there's a bird of prey on the lookout for us and she can fire while she's cloaked
surely not
i'm getting underway now but you should know i'm in alpha quadrant the chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim
when does this conference start?
according to my information today
thank you captain sulu
why were you so careless?
me?
i have personally vouched for you in this matter captain
we volunteered?
there's an old vulcan proverb: only nixon could go to china
how could you vouch for me? that's   arrogant presumption 
i was asked by my father to open neg
i know your father's the vulcan ambassador for heaven's sake but you know how i feel about this: they're animals
jim there is an historic opportunity here 
don't trust them don't believe them 
they're dying
why were you snooping in my office?
lieutenant i am pleased to see you  the lieutenant is the first vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the academy
never been this close
i believe the captain feels that starfleet's mission has always been one of peace 
i don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy
what is it?
i am uncertain
spock i'm really tired
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation
where?
curiously it appears to emanate from us
'think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
what the 
we haven't fired 
i am responsible for involving you in this i will go
i'm going you are going to be responsible for getting me out of this meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a fullscale war on the eve of universal peace
captain
the klingons have a new weapon: a bird of prey that can fire while cloaked she torpedoed gorkon's ship
the peace conference
what peace conference?
i've been dead before uhura raise excelsior she ought to have the coordinates
why would they give them to us?
tamina was a friend of mine  my shower was broken she let me use theirs
i told teddy about you
are you dining on worms?
you were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation you might have died
i was blind i couldn't see past the death of my son i couldn't trust
i too was blind i knew about her  and i did nothing i trusted too much
you couldn't have known she was listening the night i dictated that entry into my log you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan
i was prejuduced by those achievements
can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  would that constitute a joke?
someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "s" you haven't outlived your usefulness  to me and you are not responsible just because she is also vulcan 
i should have been 
not for the actions of another no one is responsible for any actions but his own human beings 
what'd he say?
but i am not human i am only 
close enough to beam down?
captain perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; her job will be to stop us
what's she waiting for?
but we haven't run out of history just yet  your father quoted hamlet: he called the future  "the undiscovered country"
i always assumed hamlet meant death
the only way to find out if a man's trustworthy
control tower reading sir
channel open captain
captain 
i felt guilty 'cause i "owed so much" to alice but even then i was starting to wonder is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? if you have a lucrative skill it's all anybody wants from you you grow older but you don't grow up you turn into  into 
we surrender
it's pretty chaotic over there there's been some weapons fire and a lot of shouting
gorkon's own man??
uhura?
captain we can't see her but she gives off heat
you have done well saavik as your sponsor at the academy i have followed your career with satisfaction and as a vulcan
sir i speak to you as a kindred intellect do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the federation?
you must have faith
faith?
but we can't allow them to be taken back to kronos as prisoners
great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire we're there
how did you  ?
her own father?
any reply from starfleet to our dispatch lieutenant
not as yet sir
curious you haven't been assisting commander uhura with her radio transmissions have you lt?
commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir
very well for twentyfour hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place
a lie?
any progress?
we've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out  but the killers may be among them surely they've disposed of these boots by now wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on gorkon's ship?
the dishes are juiced up too
suppose when they returned they threw the boots into the garbage?
a lie?
if you are logical
i don't want to
but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood
perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night lieutenant there were things i tried to tell you too  about having faith
direct hit 
trouble?
we've been ordered to 
in nineteenth century france workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines flung their wooden shoes  called sabots  into the gears to stop them hence the word sabotage
thank god
we can send a message to starfleet command 
sorry to wake you sir but starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of enterprise
what?
apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir
signal starfleet that we have no idea location of enterprise
sir?
you having hearing problems mister?
according to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector
fiftyfour planets  and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies our sensing and analytic equipment worked well
i have an energy wave from 240 degrees mark six port 
milo? shrot suspects somebody broke into #21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
don't tell me that was any meteor shower
negative the subspace shockwave originated at bearing threetwo three mark sevenfive the location is  praxis a klingon moon barren of indigenous life forms but 
i have confirmed the location sir but
what is it?
praxis?
at least we must keep track of where they are taken sir i 
no way
it's as i said mr spock: inventory still registers every torpedo
yet the data banks insist we fired: twice one computer is lying
a computer canna lie sir
they know i broke in alice helped me  shrot's not one of them he's blundering into this on his own
i think  not
you can check the torpedoes visually if you like 
we'll have to check every one of them mr scott
that could take hours
nevertheless
and if they're still in place?
they don't place the same value on life that we do spock  you know that take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear
twentyfour hours from now we won't have a clue where the captain is
they dinna fire on themselves and there were no other ships present
there was an enormous neutron energy surge
he doesn't know about the day care
too far off very near us perhaps underneath us
if another ship had been beneath us the klingons would've seen her
a bird of prey canna fire when she's cloaked
this one can
they you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr spock
 could take weeks sir
they're outside the beaming shield mr scott start your engines
they're naturally wary ma'am we've been at war a long time
i assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours uhura send to starfleet hq explain precisely what has taken place and request instructions
sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by
hardly anybody does that's the beauty part no cameras the doj doesn't bother with it it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about you know the best place to hide a leaf?
an ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains  however improbable  must be the truth
what exactly does that mean?
and they'd be right we have no evidence  just a theory that happens to fit the facts
even assuming you're correct mr spock why would they fire on their own president?
i've pulled out my  uh wooden shoe and starfleet is screaming for us to return to port
you understand that we have lost all contact with captain kirk?
i don't think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament
under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship we call it "plasma"  i do not know the klingon name for it but by any name it is merely ionized gas
they might as well arrest me too; i felt like lieutenant saavik
can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
whether you tell us or not we'll find out  better if it comes from you
yeah that's old in a tree
fuzzy face is gone
do you know who i am?
you are me
do you know where you are?
can you remember our father?
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel?
no
brother i cannot move
no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines
why?
oh
because you are dangerous
why?
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship
i do not understand
do you know anything about shinzon's plans against the federation?
no
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
no can i move now?
no i must deactivate you
for how long?
same with the excerpts i'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described
indefinitely
sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath isn't it?
when was he created?
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level i can't overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation jean luc a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds
beverly come in
remember him?
he was a bit proud as i recall
he was a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of seasoning
i so wanted to believe shinzon but the thalaron radiation can't be explained away whatever he's after it's not peace
is he very much like you were?
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
jean luc whatever you were right now you're the man you've made yourself he's someone else
aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you're completely normal
the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got finally i could only come to one conclusion shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly so he could replace you
but the romulans abandoned the plan
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age he was engineered to skip thirty years of life but since the rna sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down he's dying
how long does he have?
but we do have one advantage  he needs your blood to live he might come after you first
that was another time
you can' t imagine them jean luc they're kids all with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant
reminds me of a young doctor i used to know
you could always say you have to go the bathroom
they're running me ragged nothing but question day and night i love it come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it there's a bajoran band at the officer's mess
so to happy endings
sir  i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse laughter through tears but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously
i understand why it would seem confusing certain human rituals like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan?
will and deanna joining the titan dr crusher going to starfleet medical
and this makes you "sad"?
well i suppose it does a bit i'm very happy for them of course but i'm going to miss them the ship will seem incomplete without them
that is because you have a familiarity with them you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge
the choices i made have led me here as well this is the only home i have ever known i cannot foresee a reason for leaving
that's lame isn't it?
if i were i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior i would "miss you"
now you make a toast
to new worlds
the closest signature is two kilometers to the west that direction sir
the final signature is approx imately 300 meters up that incline
he is very observant
data
starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record we can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander he fought seventeen major engagements in the war all successful beyond that we know nothing
data to captain picard geordi and i have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access and i believe we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage
my mission was a success sir i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation
does he know you know?
good work the download?
a bit less florid data
a weapon
geordi equipped me with the prototype for the emergency transport unit i recommend you use it to return to the enterprise
it'll only work for one of us
yes sir
we'll find a way off together recommendations?
alacrity would be appreciated commander
they are trying to override the access codes reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and
what do you imagine this is?
he suspects i know something i think he was sort of  explaining himself to me in case i do  we have to go in tonight i'm two hours from a beta version  but i've gotta go home for an hour
can you open the shuttlebay doors?
affirmative sir negative sir they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals
do you think this is a wise course of action?
we're about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark
ready captain
how long until we reach the fleet?
"for now we see but through a glass darkly" he said he's a mirror
of you?
yes
i do not agree although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual
why?
but so much is the same on a biological level he is and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him
he would deny a "human" connection is possible he considers himself entirely reman
he may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
no sir it is not possible the b9 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced but even if they were he would not be me
how can you be sure?
we are passing through the bassen rift the projections will return when we have cleared it
it's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography?
yes sir the rift effects all longrange communications
we are losing dorsal shields
captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine
she called to apologize i said i was pulling an allnighter she said then come home just to say hi which i always do when we fight it's suspicious if i don't
we are being hailed
sir allow me to go you are needed here
negative
why am i looking at me?
you are not looking at your self you are looking at me
you have a red shirt
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation
why?
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle
since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on kolarus iii
if i tell you will you arrest me?
please don't go
how many of you did dr soong make?
isolated pockets of humanoids it appears to be a prewarp civilization at an early stage of industrial development
at present he serves no useful function dr soong created us to become active and useful members of society i do not believe he would have wanted the b9 to live out his life in his present state
i can't believe the captain went along with a memory download
captain picard agrees that the b9 was probably designed with the same selfactualization parameters as myself if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities
he'd have all your memories too you feel comfortable with that?
i feel nothing geordi it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual
an individual more like you you mean
yes
what purpose does this serve?
meet me at the other location
it seems to be a redundant memory port  maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
dr soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions
it's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics?
but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions
don't give up hope data i know i know you're not capable of hope
we have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten
what is our approximate distance?
it appears to be   an arm
why is it moving?
it's you
they know i had no choice get out of the house now do you have a laptop?
no
if you wouldn't mind
and you needn't worry i'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know
may i have this dance?
counselor
do you have a moment sir?
it's about data  i've watched him with the b9 and i'm troubled data's desire for a "family" is very strong i'm afraid he may be investing too much in the b9
you're speaking of emotional investment?
the b9 is like a slow child sir and data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian i'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences he'll be disappointed when the bi9 cannot meet those expectations
i'm going to miss you
it's three years old it 
i would say he's been trained to resist telepathy what i could sense of his emotions were erratic very hard to follow
is he sincere about wanting peace?
sir the strongest sense i had was that he's more than urious about you he very much wants to know you  the same way you want to know him
how could i not?
captain don't assume he's anything like you are you should resist the urge to think you know him
shinzon's viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts i've become a liability i request to be relieved of my duties
how can you be certain?
captain  i might have a way to find them
counselor?
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me
bring it to the other location
but how can he? he'll kill you
i'm only half human
imzadi this is so good
he can never know you as i know you he can never touch you as i touch you
this isn't real
i'll always be with you now now and forever
you're not here
no
captain picard commander donatra of the warbird valdore might we be of assistance?
your timing is impeccable commander
maybe it's the satellite
the empire considers this a matter of internal security we regret you've become involved
i'm afraid that drink will have to wait captain
do you have life support?

open a channel
this is commander donatra of the valdore we're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies
it's very faint but i've isolated it to the third planet in the kolarin system
what do we know about the planet?
uncharted we'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan
i read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface
he knows
cannon fodder
it's going to take some time to find out  the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship
what programs were accessed?
that's what i don't get  it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations it's not even restricted material
set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting if it happens again we want to be ready
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up but he's got it captain
it's called a cascading bio genic pulse the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship or a planet
he's getting his cloak back we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes phaser banks are down to four percent
what's he doing?
what?
he thinks he knows exactly what i'm going to do
geordi put 211 power to the engines  take it from life support if you have to  everything you can give me
aye sir
deanna on my mark
how long until he can fire?
you have the bridge commander use all available power to move away from the scimitar  now mister la forge
sir we're being hailed
geordi prepare the shuttle bay for arrivals they don't know our procedures so just open the doors
i'll take care of it sir
admiral janeway good to see you
latitude 47 degrees

with or without the rest of the fleet?
a diplomatic mission we've been invited believe it or not seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup the new praetor someone called shinzon has requested a federation envoy
new praetor?
 believe me we don't under stand it either you're the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say get the lay of the land if the empire becomes unstable it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant
understood

not with the romulans

just lucky admiral
you got my email?
enterprise we are the reman warbird scimitar
praetor shinzon i'm pleased to
so human you've met your better self
what are you doing to counsellor troi?
i'm preparing her for shinzon to sooth him as she soothes you to stand at his side as she does at yours
that will never happen
it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest
there'll be another after me and another after that you'll find we're a resilient species
captain i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear  naked
i'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system
are you here illegally?  don't worry about that  we'll talk to immigration they won't deport you
and your phone messages you wanna do what you do it's not a crime
to find the head sir?
sir i recommend we raise shields
no
captain
tactical analysis mister worf
we're being hailed
sir we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer
worf prepare a full phaser spread zero elevation all banks on my mark scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes
sir we're being hailed
coordinate our attack with the valdore's tactical officer triangulate fire on any shield impacts
is that how larry feels?
captain the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock
what's this?
diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone
i think it's worth a look don't worry number one we'll get you to betazed with time to spare
captain i hope i don't have to remind you 
i appreciate your concern number one but i've been itching to try out the argo
sir 
captain you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators
a coup d'etat?
wanted to say goodbye to him
why don't they answer our hails?
it's an old psychological strategy number one to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy
it's working
captain with all due respect to diplomatic protocols   the federation council's not sitting out here we are
she's not out for a pleasure cruise
not very chatty
he wasn't designed to live a complete human life span
sir?
his hatred of the federation is apparent he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason he is going after earth
oh boy destroy humanity and the federation is crippled
we rented a loft in sunnyvale  you know what's the bad part? we can't talk about work anymore we're competitors the venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms
strength in numbers?
report
counselor troi report to the bridge
unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark
but she's not the enterprise
i promise you in time she'll become your home if i could offer you one piece of advice?
anything
when your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions ignore him
serving with you has been an honor
i hope you'll forgive the darkness we're not comfortable in the light
but these like white supremacists trashed my office last week
and you're not as we imagined you
praetor?
i am commander riker  may i touch your hair?
yes i'm sorry captain  there's so much we have to talk about
i would be interested to know what we are talking about
i want to end the centuries of mistrust i want to be your ally not your enemy as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas
and the senate supports you?
yes
but you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me
yes
they're in the neighborhood they usually hassle vietnamese grocers
no one knew what to do finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalaft's syndrome do you know of it captain?
we need to talk just you and i
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow just the two of us or just the one of us
you know i need to verify this
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me an exact biological duplicate put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet toinfluence your command structure it was a bold plan
what happened?
romulan ale  i'm surprised i can't stand it
it's not quite the face you remember
not quite i envy the hair line
a lifetime of violence will do that my nose was broken four times and my jaw but so much is the same the eyes you recognize the eyes
jesus teddy
yes the eyes have it
our eyes reflect our lives don't they? yours are so confident
how did you end up on remus?
for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sisterplanet but the time has come for us to live as equals
you're doing this to liberate the remans?
you don't trust me
and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons ibility in representing the federation i can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions
i want to know  where i come from the remans gave me a future you can tell me about my past
there's so much and so much of it is dull
were we always explorers?
i'm cool they didn't touch the machine or my disks probably didn't know what they were so you a moonie yet?  milo?
no i was the first picard to leave earth  it caused quite a stir in fact but i had spent my whole life
looking up at the stars
yes
and you dreamed about what was up there about
after you praetor
so i'm not as tall as you expected?
i always hoped i would hit two meters
with a full head of hair
shinzon i'm trying to believe you
i know
i met this girl
if there's one ideal the federation holds most dear it's that all men all races can be united from the first time the vulcans came to earth we've sought a future of peace nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend ship in time when trust has been earned
in time jean luc
hello jean luc
why am i here?
what are you doing?
all of this so you could capture me?
what's this all about?
it's about destiny picard about a reman outcast who
you're not reman
and i'm not quite human so what am i? what do you see?  do you see a life you might have led? lost youth never to be recaptured?
what? come on is it serious?
i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is
i see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do i see the man i will never be
i won't defend my life to you
my life is meaningless as long as you're alive what am i while you exist? a shadow? an enigma?
if your issues are with me this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation
oh but it does  we will no longer bow like slaves before anyone not the romulans and not your mighty federation we're a race bred for war for conquest
think about what you're doing shinzon are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
it amazes me how little you know yourself
i'm incapable of such an act and so are you
you can't trace my holographic emitters captainn so don't bother and you can't contact starfleet we're quite alone
it's shakespeare  maybe you've heard of him?
a cop?
i don't know
we are
it's just the two of us now jean luc as it should be your ship and mine you and me
why are you here?
to accept your surrender i can clearly destroy you at any time lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship
and what of the enterprise?
i have little interest in your quaint vessel captain if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years it will not be harmed
you know that's not possible
i know you'll all gladly die to save your home world
i know you as well as i know myself shinzon there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be
long ago
did you tell alice?
not so long
childish dreams captain lost in the dilithium mines of remus i'm what you see now
the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet he is better than that
yes
so if i gave you my life what would you do with it? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? or could you change? could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? a father's words you never heard? could you do that?
i don't know
that's your life not mine
you can still make a choice make the right one now
i hope you're still alive jean luc
i am
no i keep thinking it'll go away but there's this  connection she's been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot plus i see her every day we're working on the same program she's  beautiful
praetor we've received the transponder signal
report
target disruptors destroy them
deploy the weapon kill everything on that ship then set a course for earth
what about picard?
our greater goal is more important brother
well that sounds relaxing too
he's a very unusual android
my god
minimal damage to the scimitar
a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but what're the chances?
believe it or not i think the cavalry has arrived
intruder alert
are we prepared?
this is a mistake
he's gentler than i thought and he has a sense of humor
don't forget our mission shinzon we should act now time is running out
the bond is broken
find her again
no  this is wasting time
it's accelerating you have no more time for games
what d'you mean?
how long?
how long until we reach the rift?
let her pursue  drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop
what?
praetor
what is it? focus on your job
join us commanders  now what's the disposition of the fleet?
they're holding position
and?
they will obey praetor
i dunno i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place
how many warbirds will you need?
praetor you have the whole fleet at your disposal they supported the coup they'll follow you
the scimitar will serve my needs
but surely
then i don't understand the reason for the delay
you don't have to understand
and bringing the enterprise here? what possible purpose could that serve?
i have a purpose
then perhaps you will enlight en us?
praetor
what does that mean?
the enterprise is immaterial they won't make it back to federation space

i thought we discussed patience commander
commander suran the games are over in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair does that satisfy you?
for the moment
benny god take it easy
right in line with that burning tree
i don't see anything
benny there's nothing there
there is they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses
milo geeks don't have two girlfriends most don't have one
what did i tell you?
don't you think you should call a backup?
mike call for backup  benny you all right?
i don't think so 
gate three it's boarding now
thank you
what can i do for you folks?
how much are your rooms?
you have one with two beds?
sure
so  how far are we from the campus?
i'll take that
fill this out  will this be cash or credit card?
credit card
i'll have to run your card off now
we're only going to be here a few hours
do you have a good map of death valley?
food eat i prepare food i work as a cook that's how i make money

what do you think of america?
well here we are you go down that ramp there you're sure to get a ride
thank you
no no
i'm from a small town in slovakia  like the south here  the police is right a civilian is wrong  so i fled
his snapples were in alphabetical order
where did you stop last?
what the hell do you think you're doing?
where did you stop last?
stay right there
what was your last stop?
elmo's
where's that?
we're going damn  we'll tell the press that there was an accident chemical warfare spill that cover cannot be violated in any way understand me shermin?
major bell here sir we have to tell these people that we're friendly that this whole thing was a mistake is anyone trying to contact the ship?
recognize this?
every geek here's got a thing for lisa but that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody
it's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes
houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit
it's real george
there's no mistake? you're absolutely sure?
i saw it with my own eyes we've killed an extraterrestrial and
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
none and there's another one in the area that's alive i don't know if it's the only one i don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva
get the body out of there load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson they'll take it from there we didn't expect this shermin
we'll need a lot of help george you could hide an army up here
i'm going to the white house right now i'll try and get you everything you need
she's a programmer?
contain it and get back to me
then it's not an accident that they found us
we don't think that's necessarily bad at least it's a point of contact
not necessarily bad if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for
that's not going to happen george unless you get us the help you promised us
we've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public it's been decided not to expand the search at this time
don't let them do it this way george it's too important we can't find this thing alone
george we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial
when can we expect containment?
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  you'll be working with her
well we're in pursuit of a green mustang
it's in a green mustang?
why did you let it get into a populated area?
it's taken on a disguise
clarify that
the extraterrestrial now looks like this
you sure you want this because that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over
i'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk
i don't like it george
dammit shermin earlier you were asking for help what's changed?
i've got a girlfriend remember?
it's messy the thing's got a gun we're just asking for somebody to get killed
we don't know what else to do we need results
you'll get results one way or the other that's for sure okay
we're growing very concerned back here there's no use pretending otherwise we're rapidly approaching a 'condition red' people are beginning to ask difficult questions
i'll make this as simple as i can george they disappeared
i don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air
george listen to what you're saying this thing's changed itself into a man disappearing may not be that big a deal
maybe look this is just something to think about from what i got at the shopping center it was more scared than anything else i don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is
is that what's affecting your performance?
i'm not being unpatriotic and i'm doing my damndest to catch them bell's up on 80 and i'm down here on 70 past grand junction they're heading west if they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them all i'm asking is that you people think about it
what're they building?
hello george
shermin
what's all this for?
we have a new directive i'm taking over
we don't have to do it that way we can catch him this time
washington thinks it's too late for that
i've never been taken off an assignment in my life give me twenty four hours and i'll have him for you
you're not hearing me
you can change a directive george you've done it before listen to me he's going somewhere in death valley lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop east is the nuclear site there are no roads in there she was teaching him to hitchhike i'm telling you we block the four roads into death valley and we got him
we'll do that but how are we going to hold him? he can change himself into a man he can disappear
#21 way behind schedule it's top secret but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space they see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
that's the chance we have to take
no we don't
then you're going to have to do it without me
you're a career intelligence officer shermin you'll be in the air with us
no deal
george do you hear me george?
what?
i just retired

jennyhaydn

fellas i'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now
goodbye
what?
what happened?
why did your ship land on this planet on earth?
you thought we were a different planet?
no my ship was doing a map of all the suns and
stars when a sun is far away we call it a 'star'
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship my eh we kidnapped it on it there was a map that said how to come to earth this was very important before then we thought we were the only people in all the stars
you did? that's funny so did we
yes?
wait a second i'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
yes
we told our home and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk not to land not to shoot just to look from up there we came and the driver of my ship
the captain
the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home the police came and shot at us one of the people from my ship was killed
oh that's terrible i'm sorry was he a good friend?
i don't understand 'friend'
a friend is a person that is good to you someone you like to be with someone you like to laugh with
he was a good friend the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship
the police shouldn't have started shooting but you can hardly blame them you surprised them they didn't know you were up there when they saw you they thought you were here to hurt us
i understand
you seem surprised to see me
sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home
what is hell?
it's bad
what are you doing?
are you my friend?
yes
nobody knows
why?
i like this music
i've noticed do you understand what they're saying?
i thought you'd quit while you were ahead
do you have music up there?
yes
i'd like to hear it can you sing something?
i do not want to
i am not a good singer
that was beautiful
you liked my singing?
put that back
you shouldn't drink so much of that stuff it's bad for you
on the radio they say it's good
what and watch all my earnings go  down the toilet?
the machine gave me two should i put one back?
no get in
you can have one
are you angry at me?
i told you goodbye why are you here?
the police are waiting for you up ahead there's a roadblock you have to go back
this car will take me to las vegas i cannot go back
if i don't meet the ship my people will go home without me
please understand if you go this way you'll never get to your ship the police know about lathrop wells we have to go another way i'll get you to your ship i promise
i will go but not you
what do you want mr cunningham was it?
you shit i'll decide if i go or not not you i don't know what you do on your planet but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did
i don't want you to be hurt
where are you going?
i must meet my ship
why can't we wait here for a ride?
i feel better if i move
asshole
where did you learn that?
we're not going to get a ride tonight
i can't stay on this planet
call me ritchie miss fagina may i call you alotta  please?
no one's traveling in this weather
you promised you would get me to my ship
i will i will we still have another day
you promised
what are you saying?
you can stop i will go on alone
why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
i used the last one to jump off the cliff
let's find a place out of the rain i'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning
i can't be late i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet i don't know if my words went to the ship if i'm not there the captain will think i'm dead and go
you may
you are cold
you're damn right i am
what?
good morning
horses
you don't forget anything do you?
hello hello how are you this morning?
do they talk?
no they don't talk we talk to them
oh you're pretty
your boss number two i understand that cat's involved in big underground drills
they are beautiful
yes they are
you have been very good to me jennyhaydn  you said you wanted a baby so i gave you one
but
it will be human and it will look like this  but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have
i told you it's impossible for me to have a baby
the cowboys were right you can make money fast gambling
may i have twentyfive cents please?
what for?
here are two quarters when you lose these you're not going to get anymore
it was my decision not his
virtucon's main interest is in cable television but they do have a subterranean construction division yes how did you know?
this is crazy we don't have time for this
i know how to gamble now
you won ten dollars big deal if we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship
i want to get money for you and the baby
i don't need any money for the baby i'll be fine
inflation tuition college children are damned expensive i know
the cook again?
yes
it'll tell you pretty much everything about us
this is very interesting we are born knowing our history we have other books but not a book like this
i didn't baby you just told me
any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary
i understand
it'll give you the different countries how they came to be what they are now how america came to be the governments the languages everything
many of my people will not believe those things are possible on my planet there is only one government one people one language i will be asked a lot of questions
what will you say about us?
i will say that we can be friends
this is yours
if you want to keep it you can
would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
you want the baby to laugh at me
it's for the mining industry mr cunningham we can talk about business later but first let me slip into something more comfortable
how long will it take you to get home?
i'm sure we could find a country and western station
there
the yellow one
oh wow i'll tell you what when the baby is born we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you
where do you think you're going?
thank you jennyhaydn you are good i must go alone now
well
what do i do now?
i love you
come in
i'm never going to see you again am i?
tell the baby about me
i will
help me
you could have killed us both
jesus christ you crazy people
call the police
help me
oh god man don't shoot me my mistake i'm sorry
you sure this is your car?
i'd rather talk about number two
my grandmother's rich
slow down slow down
i told you i'm looking for someone
in the cars too?
i don't know where he is
they after you?
what? no of course not
i'm telling you you're going to find him at the roadblock or right after or not at all
if he didn't want to go through the roadblock is there any other way to get to vegas?
the fivefifty we already passed it but it'll take him way out of his way
may i wash you?
pull over i've got to get back there
why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock? what did you guys do? i won't tell anybody
wait could i have your autograph?
i have nothing to do i'd like to help you
is it for real?
aghh i'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow
this is crazy what were we going to do if that had been the ship? we have two thirty calibre machine guns three m16's and some handguns
that's because the ones that were hurt died they couldn't talk to you
good it looks like we might be the welcoming committee so i think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature
bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow
in japan men come first and women come second
i know she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus he didn't stay on though and they drove off together
doesn't make sense
tell him i'm not here
you get that lyman?
i'm telling you they're probably friendly
they're gonna let some local cop blow him away
save us all a lot of trouble
jesus lyman you're an ignorant fool
bullshit
you have no conception of this do you?
or sometimes not at all
this has always been my favorite time of day
very beautiful country up here
any signs of biological contamination excessive radiation anything like that?
not on the landscape we're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going
can you see under the faceplate?
there's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then
we had a flight of f16's play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour then it shot straight up and disappeared
was there visual contact?
no sir radar
after i called in i had a chance to sit down with the three locals they swear there's another one that didn't make the ship it might be alive
care for some saki?
people have made mistakes in these situations before
oh jesus
there's nothing no reports of sightings or landings or anything in the other parts of the country or overseas seems like a totally isolated incident
it was only an accident that we discovered them
you married major?
twentyeight years
to the same woman?
yes
how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
it was kind of like clicking maybe a language wasn't it?
how do you feel mr cunningham?
listen to this  a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'
it was a man though right?
nothing up there the grass is matted down in a few places but that could have been anything
where are you going?
las vegas please i do not speak english
i don't understand
good job neither do i what do you do for a living?
i don't understand
i'm a cook do you understand 'cook?'
i told you
well i'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i'd like to be included in decisions
'pardon me for being rude it was not me it was my food  it just popped up to say hello and now it's gone back down below'
judy that's stupid
well maybe these men won't think so we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat i happened to look out the window and there was scott haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling jenny down the walk to the car
you know that's impossible
i know what i saw i've seen him enough times
is there a reward in this?
huh? eh no there isn't
because i'm the one who called the police you know
yeah thanks we appreciate that
hey it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard you want my opinion it's the girl she had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid
you saw that?
that's very clever do you know any other poems?
eh the store tells you to call when there's trouble so they won't get sued but that shouldn't matter if there's a reward right?
i wouldn't think so
that's what i thought so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late you know
hello
i must get to my ship mr shermin
we can't let you do that
all the roads into death valley are blocked we'd like to talk to you
if i talk to you i will miss my ship
yeah that's right
i saw you play man  you were good like a fucking freight train i remember saying  so what happened injuries or what?
'milk milk lemonade  round the corner fudge is made  stick your finger in the hole and out comes a tootsie roll'
bullshit politics
it's always politics  like this thing we're in here he's paying you to tune me up right?  but i could pay you more not to  see what i mean?  i could write you a check right now
come on let's go i got to get back
okay cash  logical  here's everything i have on me what do you say?  how about a rolex?
i already got a real one  come on it won't be too bad  it's not personal
okay let's get you wired up  i hope this axle grease you got in your hair doesn't screw up the squid receptors
superconducting quantum interference device  squid  got it?  there's gonna be a test
hey fuck you man
easy eduardo easy  preserve a sense of humor at all times  okay the receptor rig what i'm putting on your head sends a signal to the recorder  see we call it "being wired" but there's no wire  you gotta keep the recorder close five six feet away max like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow know what i mean?
some tips  don't dart your eyes around  don't look in the mirror or you'll id yourself  ok?  you got a half hour of tape so give me some leadin to the main event  but don't wait too long i don't want to be going out for popcorn  and don't act natural  don't act at all just forget the thing is on  got it?
thank you that's beautiful to your health
no problem
we have nothing to talk about lenny
lenny the loser  panhandler of stolen dreams
leave him alone tran
he's no concern of mine as long as you don't talk to him  don't talk to anybody  you understand?  not with everything that's going on right now
you're too goddamned paranoid
look tran lenny just came by to give me some bad news  an old friend of mine has been murdered you remember iris?
i made my choice lenny
you said you were going to get her out of this
maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in  it was touching the way you stood by me in there  "stand by your man" i was moved  you were very good  i don't think he even understands that you did it for him
to my health
he doesn't know what's going on leave him alone
the only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head
fuck you
well i'm certainly in the mood for a party
take her up to the suite  have a glass of champagne or six i'll be up in a while to help you ring in the new year
this piece of puke hired me to kill you baby  do you believe that? isn't that right tran?  you pinhead
oh my god  i don't believe this is happening
believe it  now bring me the trodes baby  come on quick
you can't just kill him
i'm not  just a little poach job
do you mind if i ask you a personal question?
jesus
look baby it's now of never the guy is a known input junkie so a little od won't surprise anybody it's the only way we can be together  you know it's true
you were supposed to go downstairs baby
i know  i don't always do exactly what i'm told  so i said 'do you enjoy watching me?'  and you said  come on max
i said 'yeah  i'd even do it for free'
and then she said 'since we're going to be spending so much time together'
hey you going to watch or you going to do?
i feel like you're turning me into a vcr
i don't feel anything  is it on?
forget it's there
is it about my teeth?
cut it out tran
i don't think that's a good idea lenny
faith call me okay?
hi baby  i've missed you
i know  lenny if tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you
you have to go  i mean it
yeah ok whatever you say  just answer one question  is anything wrong?  iris said you might be in trouble
you talked to iris?  when?
tonight
well i haven't seen her in months who knows what's going on in her head  you're really running out of excuses to come around aren't you?
yes
i know you faith  you're afraid of something  what's going on?
let it alone lenny  it'll take care of itself
it's tran isn't it?  this guy is poison faith  listen to me  he's got you walled in on all sides  and he uses the wire too much he gets off on tape not on you
that's a good one coming from you
why don't you just split?  you don't love him anybody can see that  and to him you're just some kinda possession like a ferrari something to show the other guys
he has his uses too
what?  he gonna record you on his label?
maybe
look baby i've watched you create yourself out of nothing  you're like a goddamn cruise missile targeted on making it  and you will
damn right
damn what exactly do you do at virtucon?
you have to get out of here  if tran catches you he'll he's acting crazy  he's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid  he's such a control freak he's even paying max to follow me around
max pelcher?  you're kidding?
yeah for about a month now  lenny just stay away from tran okay?  and stay away from me  stop trying to rescue me  those days are over i'm a big girl now  stop trying to save me okay because i don't need saving just give up on me
can't do it
you're crazier than i thought lenny  coming here tran's just in there
who did it?
don't know  but this guy's real damaged goods  iris knew someone was after her and she said you were in danger too  now no more games faith  whatever you're hiding whatever's going on you have to get out of here now come with me right now  don't even think about it
then what?  then what lenny?  you going to protect me?  big tough guy you're a talker lenny  you don't even have a gun
i have a gun  it's under my bed
you don't know what you're fucking with here
i'll tell you all in due time after we make love but first tell me another poem
what's going on?
faith we know about jeriko  iris made me a copy of the tape
how did it happen?  what was iris doing riding around with jeriko wearing a wire?
we should talk alone
so finally he gives iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do
yeah he figured out what to do all right
you think tran killed her?
the killer knew right where she was because he put her there
i understand  no i'm not
you understand?  attorney  right? am i right?
look after jordy briefs me you can do the press conference  how about that? the case is all yours
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'press the button pull the chain out comes a chocolate choochoo train'
no
a virgin brain  well we're going to start you off right  so what do you know about this?  save us some time
just what i've read  that the technology was developed for the feds to replace the body wire  and now it's gone black market  so uh do i get the deck from you?
i'll set you up get you a deck at my cost since my thing is the software
clips
that's right  clips  look i want you to know what we're talking about here  this isn't like tv only better  this is life  it's a piece of somebody's life  pure and uncut straight from the cerebral cortex  you're there you're doing it seeing it hearing it feeling it
what kind of things exactly?
sounds good
i can get you what you want  you just have to talk to me  i'm your priest your shrink your main connection to the switchboard of souls  i'm the magic man the santa claus of the subconscious  you say it you even think it you can have it  you want a girl you want two girls?  i don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about you want a guy?  you want to be a girl see what that feels like? you want a nun to tie you up?  it's all doable
talk to me about costs here
austin powers? hi i'm andy warhol
listen before we get into numbers i want you to try a taste  i got a deck with me
what?  right here?
yeah i'm interested but can we get someplace a little less public?
you see the look on that preppy puke's face?  fuckin' pissed in his topsiders
okay  it was funny  but it cost me money
come on amigo the world's full of marks  and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do pal  you could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring  let me buy you a drink
bobbyyyy  tequila por favor double shots  make it tres generaciones huh  nothin' but the best for my good friend lenny the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad  hey nice tie
thanks max
d'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe
hey how are you?
that's not sayin' much
you were lucky max
naw  she won't call me
just as well lenny  you gotta get past it  i mean sure faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get i mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone but it's over campadre
i just hate to see you pining away it makes me want to vomit frankly  broken hearts are for assholes
see if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense
uh unh carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket
i'm telling ya it's over  we used it all up
shoulda told me about your new gig buddy
i was gonna tell ya  hey it's just a job  i feel like shit about it
hungry
you should feel like shit
i figured what the hell i could take the prick's money and make sure faith was ok at the same time  do us both good  right?
fairly twisted logic max even for you  hey at least you got a job  watch her for me  stay on her
you alright?  y'okay?
yeah  no not really
let's work it
not now i don't want to think about it
come on lenny  you used to be good at this stuff  play it down what's the perp doing?
he stalks her  he rapes her  then he does her
and he records it  thrill kill wants to see it again  and again
i'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it
he records himself raping and killing her
but at the same time he's sending the signal to her
so she feels what he feels while he's in her  the thrill while he's killing her is sent to her heightening her fear which in turn heightens the turn on for him  i've seen a lot max
so've i  too much
but this is a bad one
top ten
that's right  he wants to share needs an audience  this is one sick puppy
hey the last day of the world and you spend it in bed
faith ok?
yeah  she's leaving with tran so i got to boogie  real quick iris checked into the sheraton last night under a false name  paid cash
if you can become famous everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame man
looks like she was holding out
yup  hey so i heard you dropped in on tran last night  another slick lenny move
he's in this somehow i don't know how  just stay close to faith
sounds like tick's already celebrating
he's been cookedoff
is he dead?
whattya mean?
all i'm saying you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes  i've heard stuff
what stuff?
jesus
"fifteen minutes of fame?" i'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that either
yeah  so don't walk near me in public alright
mace no disrespect but you run this on the 11 o'clock news by midnight you got the biggest riot in history  they'll see the fucking smoke from canada
okay what about strickland?
he's got her up in the room under guard  and he's still working the party acting smooth like nothin's nothin'  so buddy i say we work a trade
what do you mean?
give him the tape  see?  it's fucking brilliant  the tape for faith  i know he'll go for it  i can set it up
this is what we laughingly refer to as a plan right?
2203  got it  stay on her
no  i suppose not  i didn't know you were colorblind max
i'll have that  glock 22  nice
hello austin this is basil exposition chief of british intelligence  you're austin powers international man of mystery and you're with agent mrs kensington the year is 1967 and you're talking on a picture phone
where's faith?
i sent her to the party  i figured i'd wait up here until you killed tran
you just did
jesus
so i killed tran  then you ran in being on his payroll and shot me
wait a minute  now i'm remembering i killed iris too didn't i?
that's right  they'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment  the one i left for you at the club was a copy
was i a really busy guy?  did i do tick too?
picture it i feel like i gotta share this with somebody  it's too perfect
i won't say anything
we know all that exposition
only he doesn't know about me and faith  so i say to myself if i turn the job down he just gets somebody else  and i lose faith to coin a phrase  so to buy time i do the skank  i still gotta do something about tran i figure it's him or me but i can't cap him without a chump to take the fall  and who better than his girlfriend's loser exboyfriend a known criminal who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times
and who was regrettably also your best fucking friend
no plan is perfect lenny  hey cheer up  world's gonna end in ten minutes anyway
you must be so pleased i followed your jellybean trail right here like a good little chump
so there never was a death squad
naawww
just those two loosecannon cops running around covering their butts
how did you hook up with faith?
don't have a fucking coronary lenny
well you could've at least warned me  you know i hate the zap when they die  it just brings down your whole day  jeez tick
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time we've just received word that dr evil the ultimate square is planning to take over the world
how'd you get the tape?  why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
with all the blood i guess they didn't see the rig  guy had it under a wig
yeah but how'd it get to you?
i got ways lenny i got ways  okay okay i got a deal with some a the paramedics  my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue  so whaddya think?  this clip's gotta be worth at least a grand  right?
tick  not to dash your hopes but i don't deal this kind of product you know that  i'll give you four for it cause i've gotta cut off the last bit  and my customers want uncut
fuck that  the last part's the best  you drydive six stories and blammo  jack right into the big black
i don't deal blackjack clips  it's policy  i got ethics here
yeah when did that start?  come on man  it's what people want to see and you know it
so lay it off to somebody else
give me six at least  this's a good clip here  gets you pumpin'
oh yeah?  alright
dr evil? i thought i put him in jail for good
yeah well the first part's okay better than the usual soaps you bring me
sure like this lowgrade shit here some girl in a fight with her boyfriend it's a testpattern nothing happens  i'm snorin'
hey you're always saying 'bring me real life  bring me street life and like one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's technicolor'
i said that?  look i'll take it for five and you'll make out okay because in this case it's pure cream you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer
ha  that's for fucking sure
whoa  that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck
skip the art criticism tick what can you tell me about the wearer
lookit you see the peak period ratios there?  could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something some kind of trauma  this is not good  i don't like this at all
what?
well it's cutting awful close to me  i mean she was just here
just where you'd never think to look for him we'll be there
who was just here?
iris man  pay attention
wait wait wait a minute  iris was here?
yeah she came by last night shaking like a junkie wanting me to make a copy of some clip
what clip?  what was it?
i don't know man she wouldn't let me see it  said i wouldn't want to see it  she said she was going to give it to you to hold for her like insurance or somethin'
you come to peddle me some tapes lenny?  for old time's sake?  make a couple bucks for the holidays?
you're not a client anymore tran i wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls
show a little respect nero  the man was an important artist
yeah important for your label which no doubt is why you're in mourning  don't worry his records'll sell out now he's dead you'll make out
good luck austin
i always do
about what?
charm
it's alright  he means it
nero
strickland
commissioner strickland
sure  whatever  see since you shitcanned my career i don't even have to call you sir  one of life's small pleasures
aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
i don't like disappointments nero and do you know what disappoints me very much?
thank you
your sex life?
greetings gents  so let's hear this week's sad story
thanks for giving me a ride  i just have a few stops mostly on the west side
whoa whoa whoa  i said i'd drop you home but i'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds  i've already pulled twelve hours today
come on mace  this is gonna be a big night  can't you feel it?  the energy in the air?  there's money to be made dreams to sell
sleaze to peddle
just a couple of hours  it'll be fun
excuse me  what part of no don't you understand?
mace you're my friend  i need you plus i'll give you 25% of what i make tonight
jeez you're pathetic  okay i got a pickup at the st james  i'll take you there you can get a cab
oh and austin
mace  you're a lifesaver
so what's up with you?  another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
no wrong i sell experiences sex is only part of it
buncha technoperv jerkoffs
way i look at it i actually perform a humanitarian service  i save lives
uh huh i wanna hear this part
okay take some executive bored with his life bored with his wife he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar  then he goes around for months torn up worrying that he's got aids that he'll infect his wife  and maybe he really does catch something
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig
everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime it's what we are  but now the risks are outa line  the streets are a war zone  and sex can kill you  so you slip on the trodes you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks
lenny this shit's illegal
yes?
define illegal
me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months
yeah but that was for love
what's his name?
fumitsu
what the fuck are you doing?
coming with you
are we having a bad night?
hey careful on the jacket  this is armani  you angry?
i've had enough of this shit  you're on foot lenny
be careful
i need my case  it's still in the back
that would be no
i've had it  no more wirehead shit in my car  you understand?  you want to poach your lobes do it somewhere else
i thought we were friends
no see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another  you just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act  well i'm out  i got a kid i got rent i got an ex husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support i'm just trying to hold on here
so am i  just trying to get by
no you're just trying to get off
macey i've never seen you like this
lenny you're turning into some kinda squidhead lowlife  you're always broke you just go from one score to the next  and you're getting strung out you don't even see it  getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer
i know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me thanks mace  really
where am i?
look i gotta get some sleep
yeah  i don't see a way out of it
macey i know you're tired but can you drop me at the retinal fetish? it's on your way
jesus lenny
begging?  groveling?  any pathetic behavior at all?  will that help? faith's there tonight and i've got to talk to her
who's the new side of beef in tran's posse?
guy named wade beemer  used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97
forget her
she still loves me
she thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit  trust me on this
you're in the ministry of defense it's 1997 you've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years
she's my destiny
destiny?  you living in a perfume commercial?  she's a hardclimber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride
you're some piece of work you know that  just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl and somehow you never let it touch you i mean between vice and this so called occupation you're in now you must've seen it all
i have crawled through the gutter through every wrinkle in the human brain
what i'm saying  but you still come out this goofball romantic
what's that?  present from faith?
what is it?
my god lenny  what is it?
black  jack
blackjack?  i don't understand
who are these people?
snuff clip  it was iris  she said she needed my help and i aw jesus mace the sick fucker killed her
and gives it to you
cause you're the man right?  the magic man  if it's got something to do with the wire sooner or later it washes up on your beach
jesus mace  back off
uh unh  no way  they'd crucify me
is this great fabric or what?
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
he knows what he's doing  he's worn before a lot
so that gives you something
don't crank the gain any more you're gonna fry yourself
i'm ready to be briefed  excuse us
the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process
no more lenny
she came to me for help  i should have read it better i just figured y'know another strung out hooker having a bad night
see it's all about what they see walking in  a dead hooker handcuffs penetration they'll see a trick gone wrong  random kill  the kind you never solve
but that doesn't add does it
no it doesn't
she said "if they get me"  they which means the whole sexkiller thing is a cover which means somebody whacked her for a reason
so the guy's not a sicko
if he could do what's on that tape he's a sicko
okay so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak the point is he was a hitter somebody wanted to shut her up  but why not just put a little lead in her ear?
because it had to look random  not connected to anything or anyone  but then why give the rape to me?
yes i'm having trouble controlling  the volume of my voice
that's where it gets a little strange
and what about the guy that was following me?
the question is not whether i am paranoid but whether i am paranoid enough  you want to rub my neck?
how's zander?
i'm sorry about getting on your case earlier  i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper and i  anyway  i'm sorry
whatup lenny?
where we going?
what is it?
will you relax  there's nobody back there
mace the guy had a knife  to my throat  in my living room relaxing might be right out okay?
you might also experience a slight fever dry mouth and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation austin this is commander gilmour strategic command and general borschevsky russian intelligence
you better keep a low profile for a while
lenny have you lost it completely?
think back about what she said exactly what she said
she wanted to go out to my car something about my car
lenny give them the tape
shit
take it easy  the glass is bullet resistant
bullet resistant?  whatever happened to bullet proof?
goddamnit  911 is busy
this is bad
russian intelligence? are you mad?
are you out of your fucking mind?
i can't believe we had to give them the damn tape
those two guys were cops
you sure?
tell me
i can't tell you  you've got to see
uh unh  i won't do it
hang on  hang on max  you see?
i see  i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all
we got to make another copy of this little life insurance
a lot's happened since you were frozen austin the cold war's over
you know what this tape could do if it gets out
i've got a good idea yeah
people finding out seeing that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one  jesus  maybe they ought to see
so let's see i've got tran's goons some squidhead psycho and the lapd all trying to kill me  happy new year lenny
well look at the plus side
there's a plus side?
yeah  you gave up your hot tub tape to save me  that's real progress for you
it was a tough call
i still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops
i don't think those cops did iris i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her
thank god those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people hey comrades?
why?
he's totally cut off from the outer world
the only card we have to play is the tape  you know we get it to the media somehow
who's strickland?
kinda guy you can count on in a pinch
okay we gotta get over there  can you borrow a dress from cecile or something
i'm not going
whatya mean?  we're going  tran's gonna do her right there unless
yeah  lenny  i have
it didn't stop you from loving them right?  or understanding them or being able to forgive them
we won austin
i guess
and it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them  did it?
i worked vice narcotics violent crimes and i saw every known depravity  i was lost mace  in outer darkness  then i busted this strungout little teenyhooker when i met faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank  another lost soul
you never told me
but she was different  there was a light in her eyes and she had this voice  it was scary all that pain coming out of that little body like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice  i helped her  and i promised her that i'd always be there to protect her  see?  it's not about what's in her head  it's what's in mine  i can't let go of the promise  it's like it's all i have left
mace you're a girl
got your ticket?
you see tran?
alright  we're going up
and do what?  take on his whole posse?
when do i begin?
that's the original  there are no copies
take it to him
a cop?  you want me to trust a cop?
oh boy  what if you're wrong?
then we'll be right where we are now
are we under arrest?
hey lenny  we made it
well  get going  you're still bleeding
see you downtown
where were you mom?  did you meet a guy?
immediately you'll be working with ms kensington
just lenny
right  that explains it
what is that?
cheerios and wieners  i made it myself  it's good
we're going to aunt cecile's honey we're going to watch fireworks from there  let's go  chop chop
no  i haven't noticed because i make my payments  so max pelcher how's the pi business?
hey isn't that tran vo?
yup  he was jeriko's manager  bummer tran  lost your golden goose  couldn't happen to a nicer guy
but i mean isn't he faith's new 
he's skullfucking you bud  trying to get a reaction  maybe pushing you to do something
you mean mrs kensington?
problem is lenny knows everybody
those two psycho cops are on a slashandburn to find the tape and cover their tracks
this seems a little sophisticated for them  these are not subtle guys
so you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  it happened  the lapd executed one of the most important black men in america  who the fuck are you to bury this?
fine  do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  the gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground  and when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves  it'll be all out war and you know it
yeah well maybe it's time for a war
was this him?
um he was older
besides that
to be honest when i'm working i don't look at faces much he knew the guy's name
who did cause and origin?
vanessa's one of our top agents
testa?
have you had a chance to think about 
zorro yes ran it through my files even asked around: came up completely blank thought there might be a mexico connection el paso and all but nothing fooled around with the letter "z" turned it on it's side got "n"  there ng he's vietnamese the only thing that came to mind was zero not zorro remember suspect zero?
no
well there was some friction: i wanted to write up my work educate the public but koessler wouldn't allow it low felt koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers koessler had low reassigned to the pacific northwest seattle you know when they say stick it where the sun don't shine? that's where they stuck dick low
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials
does koessler know about the suspect zero theory?
welcome back sir how was the vacation?
takes four days to chill then its time to come back  is that?
agent duncan there's an interstate issue up on 54 run out there
yes wellagent kensington will get you set up she's very dedicated perhaps a little too dedicated  she's got a bit of a bug up her ass good luck austin the world's depending on you
agents duncan mackelway  anything new?
just mopping up nine bodies in all
anybody talk to the press?
no sir
you run the plates?
fella's name is harold speck travelin' man out of roswell
excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the fbi?
where's the nuevo american diner?
i hope that wasn't a joke because i can assure you from personal experience the fbi does not have a sense of humor
nine bodies in roswell now this  it's getting a little hairy huh?
thank you exposition
i'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself
her name is karen sumpter from near dell city just disappeared a couple weeks back vanished
you're thinking?
who knows
this isn't in our database?
agent mackelway
mack this is sheriff dylan
oh jesus sheriff i am sorry i meant to call you  i got distracted  the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims that's the good news
what's the bad news?
you tell me
oh and austin
no bad news you know the be on the lookout you asked me to send on the diner car  we got a hit on it a little town on the border socorro we got it staked out  you interested?
hey sheriff
down the road a piece is the golden sunset the notell motel socorro's contribution to international relations the car's just sitting there no activity i've had a couple hispanic officers casing it all day want to take a look?
what does the manager say?
i sent a female in the room in question was rented by an anglo cash; since then nothing  no activity no phone response
the room key's in the car on the seat
show's over boys nobody home
tape it off we'll want to finetooth comb it my guess is that the unsub is having us on he checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside tell me if i'm wrong
dylan here
sheriff dylan this is fbi agent thomas mackelway remember me?
yes?
hi there
i want to talk about the karen sumpter case
you heard?
what?
you have the body?
she's buried
i want the autopsy report where is it minnesota?
the family has gone through a lot their daughter missing the search her body found the funeral  then this order to exhume the corpse
i'm sorry this won't take long
the body was embalmed i don't understand 
be careful
turn the body over there was something in the autopsy report yes here  these burn marks
a grill pattern
ligature strangulation just like his victims a cord nylon you can tell by the indentation signature  again like his victims  look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in should have cut it off
i'm not in the mood for native american wisdom
we had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this
be my guest agent kulok scrub suits are in the back
ripped off by hand my guess perimortal: victim was alive at the time there's blood on his throat
there seems to be a discrepancy
not a discrepancy an error my capacity is 55 tons not 6
i have 6 tons
hello austin hello vanessa this is basil exposition from british intelligence  there's a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr evil many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying that's the first place you should look  well i'm off to the chat rooms
mam it's my truck i know my own capacity
you can't imagine how many men have told me that
it's been customized for sleeping capacity
oh yes i see you must get asked this a lot
jesus
you surprised me
sorry i've seen you in here always lugging that case around  whatja sell?
ah restaurant supplies i didn't get your name
you must travel a lot huh?
yeah
thank you exposition
whole country or just hereabouts?
i don't mean to be rude but
just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  how does your wife feel about it?
what?
about your being away all the time must get lonely
look
you must get lonely you ever think about you know 
excuse me?
what are you?
look mister
oh and austin
my god
not bad huh?
you're a you're sick
calm down harold  okay here's what we're going to do harold: there's a pull off up ahead we're going to stop there
oh god mister please leave me alone
you're going to miss it pay attention
i've been looking for you
the man who was with him he was a construction worker?
yes
what did he look like?
yes?
i didn't wait on him fifty or so white regular build needed a shave  that's all i remember
how did you know he was a construction worker?
he was sitting here?
there was a car in the lot when we closed gone today
what kind?
an old junker like a reservation car blue side door with brown you know primer paint new mexico plates a ford or ah yeah a ford
speck's the killer all right we got box loads of evidence did 'em all the same way: torture strangulation prostitutes i don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him  this is probably the full body count
what about his killer?
nada vague description that's all finetoothcombed speck's car the diner: no fingerprints no trace evidence
you have the photo from the diner?
you are so completely unbalanced
who do you think chief?
hello austin this is basil exposition from british intelligence thank you for confirming the link between dr evil and virtucon find out what part virtucon plays in something called project vulcan i'll need you and vanessa to get on that immediately
at the field office
he said it was a clue?
maybe something to do with zorro
don't say that don't even think that the next thing we'll be hearing about "zorro killer" in the media  this hasn't gotten out has it?
just hospital talk nothing that connects to speck
chuck hello  this is agent kulok she has a background in medical forensics
we didn't know speck was a serial the police didn't know his wife didn't know  so how did the killer know?
maybe cause he's smart
sorry to interrupt you sir but i thought you'd like to know
what?
right away exposition
we have another one
another what?
deputy director get out sir
what are you doing?
mackelway i could understand he is overemotional by nature but you agent kulok you had a shining career in front of you
look sorry don't say a word  i know this is improper i've been trying to speak with deputy director koessler i left a message i must speak with you before you go back to washington
i think i talked to him
who?
speck harold speck
from the grave?
she's working on another lead right now
i'll relay this to ciiac
they don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms 
i might point out agent mackelway the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us  which is also why you were reassigned
i had gotten their trust we were sharing fantasies i couldn't risk it
the federal bureau of investigation is not based on personal preference we share information
let some bythebook j edgar agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover?  no way
you refused to comply with a direct order
i was lucky to find much less crack the address code  no way to be sure i could have done it again
its called insubordination
how do you feel agent
then you'll have to go it alone good luck
pretty embarrassed to be honest i had him
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard
he got away i had him he got away
do you think he singled you out?
the cut on your arm  mind if we remove the bandage?
agent mackelway you're going to get your wish you're going back to washington i want you back in computer crimes fire up those chat rooms
this time sir if i may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside ciiac perhaps in military housing at quantico? i didn't get along very well with the other members of the division we thought differently
you didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder  why was that? what were you doing?
i'll take it into consideration
what i do requires confidentiality
thank you basil
i always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special? why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? why you?
you feeling okay agent mackelway?
had trouble sleeping last night sir
nothing concrete nothing i'd well nothing
i don't believe this
i'm hesitant to
"murman" was the alter identity of william heirens the original "catch me before i kill again" killer short for "murder man" it was the case that got richard low and i started in this field
i spoke with lloyd daitz
that gasbag i can imagine what he said i'm not ashamed to admit that most of what i know about criminal profiling started with richard low i have also over the years i admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments he was the most brilliant law enforcement individual i ever met
"was?"
oh and austin
we had every reason to believe he was on that plane he was supposed to be on the plane everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site we the director and i decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare dick low dead that way he could exit a hero
you suspected all along suspected he was alive that's why you came to el paso
dunlevy said there was another case ron rice in fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered the second was george sheldon i didn't enter it into vicap  i'll get you the file
how long ago?
both in the last year i suspected only someone as brilliant as dick low could find these guys  look whatever daitz told you nobody wanted to strip richard of his badge you have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close
you knew the arm slash was not "zorro"
i suspected but you were the one low contacted that's why i brought you back here
what did you think of the suspect zero theory?
i got a look in testa's computer his screen name was "imelda" have to give him that had a sense of humor
we're waiting for trace evidence results on the rice killing
yes?
we need to put out an ncic inquiry
how do you send out an apb on a dead man?
huh? sir
why did you go to chicago?
i was visiting an old college friend
you didn't tell anyone where you were?
an oversight sir i apologize i felt i needed to get away for a day the pressure paid for my own ticket
i'm told you've asked for a bureau crosscheck of flight records to and from el paso ft myers omaha the murman murder time frames
i was looking for a pattern
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation
let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation
i didn't use low's name
there was talk of a file photo
watch out for dick low he's a liar; he has his own world there was a junior agent in seattle not unlike you an agent who fell under dick's spell he'd have done anything for agent low richard got this agent to take a suspect to the crime scene beat him up force a confession  all unauthorized all illegal  the agent died that night killed by the suspect richard low got him killed worst of all we had to hush it up let the suspect go the suspect was george sheldon the second man richard killed
i understand
he's got you believing in zero now too
i need to get to amarillo immediately
have you told richard low about amarillo?
i can't the chat room isn't open for another five days
we'll wait get online with low inform him of zero's route  we'll set a trap for him
what about zero darryl hawkins?
oh yes thank you
hawkins isn't the target richard low's the target
there's a killer out there  we know who he is he could be stalking now
dick low's a killer too
miss me dave?
don't you touch him
you better hope the director doesn't stop abruptly one day david you might break your nose
you're a disgrace to law enforcement to the bureau  and to me
you are so fucked up
when i was at the rest stop there was a young boy maybe ten and his mother darryl hawkins zero abducted the boy in the men's room i tried to stop him he coldcocked me 
agent kulok that boy as we speak is in hawkins' truck probably still alive in a dark refrigerated compartment shivering in just a t shirt: put yourself in his mind freezing terrified wanting his mother put yourself in his mother's place desperate imagining the worst is happening as she pleads back there at the rest stop for someone anyone to listen to her this is not hypothetical this is real it is happening now and you can do something about it
there's one more thing austin
shut the fuck up or i'll shut you up
thanks for the ride
they sort of got me on shit detail no offense
none taken
maybe i shouldn't put it that way i'm on my best behavior i've got to watch what i say
you used to be in the behavioral science unit right?
the academy then ciiac
i read your white paper it's sort of like the bible for what they're trying to do in computer crime
how long have you been downtown?
you work with koessler?
then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
yes?
not especially
why did he come out here? what's going on?
this is a sexy case
yeah you know the vic's car he was killed this side of the state line the car then pushed across the border this by an unknown subject presumably the killer who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot which may or may not have been accidental
doesn't fit
this is no random killing no one shot deal the unsub has killed before; he's good at it so what do we have?  we have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer  and who wants the fbi to know he exists
and who kills in the manner of his victim
that information's being withheld from the media
some kids found you in a garbage dump
yes i do
be careful
relax  j edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge
the man knew how to dress
don't even go there what's up?
setting up technically anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address but by using punters a correspondent literally punts his address around the world through computers in countries that have no communication treaties the correspondent becomes "ghosted" invisible
what about the chat rooms themselves?
that's the beauty of the system this is a fugitive chat room it moves from place to place chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website chaucer buffs a dating service a pre arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms  that's where i stumbled across it  notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time usually midnight to three eastern standard at a certain website  a deserted chat room say "how to plant perennials" come tuesday twelve am bingo these likeminded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip who did what to whom who wants to do what when why and how
that's part of the reason i dropped by i need to learn this stuff
the other reason?
working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work you go into the community walk their walk talk their talk gain their confidence
they're all criminals?
hello exposition
no no no most of them  i used to think all of them  are just fantasists guys who get off telling degrading stories when i came across this fugitive chat room listened in i started to think some might actually be real that they'd gone live the challenge was to figure out which was which then i had my disagreement with koessler
"gone live?"
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "i went live last month"
this is some serious shit
taking a stryker saw cutting off the top of someone's cranium pulling the brain out  what's that a day in spring?
you got a point there
people end up in occupations for a reason they may think not but they do: occupations define us
i was going to be a physician i am a physician but i kept drifting over to criminal psych this seems to be the best of both my parents still haven't forgiven me
i was interested in two things: computers and crime they sort of came together
and one other thing
austin vanessa let me bring you up to speed dr evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for onehundred billion dollars if the world doesn't pay up in four days he's threatening to destroy the world
what's that?
look at this fellow or this one
grown man dressed like a clown does he really think he looks good?
he thinks he looks young
what's this country coming to?
take it to the next level what are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like? if he could act out his fantasies what would he do? imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands what is he thinking?
every cop has a story and every story has a girl the girl in my story was fifteen yearsold she wore a pink angora sweater  i can still see it  one day she disappeared i told the police she wouldn't run away i told them who to look for but i was just a kid i sat in the police station crying and crying my parents took me home the girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher i'd had he kept her alive a week before he killed her the police could have saved her every time i see a photo of a victim i see her that's what i want to do i want to save her
me too  make any headway with "zorro"?
none can't find a thing nothing on file nothing online it's not a part of any known killer's signature
i was thinking maybe we should ask professor daitz nobody knows this stuff better
thank you exposition only two things scare me and one is nuclear war
that's because he's a fucking wacko never met a selfpromotion scheme he didn't like what's he doing now?
i ever get like that just take me out in back and shoot me
don't be too harsh
i saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends not the victims not the families of the victims he doesn't talk about them blood money that's what it is  did he hit on you?
huh?
when you were his student? did he come on to you?
of course he did he came on to every attractive student which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
you must really think i'm a square a computer nerd
why did koessler assign you as my liaison?
because you asked him to stupid
what's the other?
there are agency regulations about this
"intraagency fraternizing"
it's a nono
i know
i've been thinking about this
does koessler ask about me?
he's called a couple times
what did you tell him?
just routine stuff
not about coming to see daitz?
excuse me?
find the feet?
no cut off while he was still alive look at his wrists damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free must have been screaming real loud when the killer chainsawed his throat unfortunately he'd soundproofed his van
we got an unsub walking around with four feet?
jesus
the tattoo?
sue ann hanson
you mean 
did they disconnect testa's computer?
you should have seen the store manager at parade of shoes she was inconsolable
mack i'm sorry i apologize i should have called i had no right to sneak in on you like that
what's the other thing you're scared of?
no jaime i apologize i didn't i had no right to speak to you like that
i came over because i couldn't sleep and was lonely i wanted to see you i thought i'd surprise you
maybe we should back off a bit
i can't they trust me they accept me i've got their confidence
no i mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me
there's the agency issue i think koessler may suspect something already we're not on the best footing with him as it is
that's true
then there's the other issue
what's that?
you need time to think about the case about you and me
carnies
i found a peephole into deviant world i'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out
and nobody else can do that?
not the way i can
that's my point remember you're a cop pretending to be a deviant it's not the other way around
don't confuse what we do with who we are
hello?
jaime? where are you?
where are you? everybody's looking for you
what's up?
my watch he toyed with me he sent me to chicago
what?
you want to get him? find something he wants get him to come to you
start killing people for real?
suspect zero
that's a crackpot theory everybody says so
this feels like something out of a spy novel
i guess i'm a little paranoid
i met with richard low  these are names of missing persons he has flagged i'm doublechecking every case but i don't want to be too obvious about it i marked the ones i'd like you to work on
slow down a second you met with low 
you were right he found me
and you're working with him?
hey chief what are you doing here?
circus folk  nomads you know they smell like cabbage
i need something tangible to hook him i told him i'd found the confidential file on the suspect zero theory
does one exist?
probably i told him koessler had ordered the report kept it secret
koessler doesn't know any of this?
i'd be real careful if i were you
it's too late for that i've gone ahead of the curve on this one there's no turning back when this is over koessler is going to be right or low is going to be right or i'm going to be right but not all of us
it's okay to be wrong just don't be dead wrong
they say richard low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead
you're putting me in a difficult position
jaime do you think when this is all over when we're in different divisions you think maybe you and me we could try again?
indeed if we could get back to the business at hand it's one thing to have a warhead it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
but why this pattern?
tom you okay?
hardly anyone calls me tom everybody calls me mack i always liked that
you okay?
yeah of course
it's quite advanced
burn marks the original me listed it as "burn residue" same place the outer thigh as karen sumpter the unsub is able to abduct kill transport and bury without detection
all the same killer?
low calls him suspect zero
suspect zero is a crackpot theory you said so
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle  i've uncovered the details on project vulcan it's a new subterranean warhead delivery system
that's what koessler wants us to believe to discredit low
you're assigned we're assigned to apprehend richard low not suspect zero i have to tell you mack i'm not comfortable where you're going
i haven't changed anything  damn
i
jaime 
it's a truck a refrigerated truck
zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away karen sumpter was buried washed up in a flood evans was buried when we get zero we'll find boneyards all across the country
how are we going to find him?
what happened?
agent
my god austin what have you done?
kulok
unlock these cuffs
mack must think zero has a police band
uncuff me what's wrong with you? don't you want to save the boy?
okay i'll unhook you no weapon
no weapon
bitch cunt please please please don't do this agent kulok you need me
how did you know speck was a killer?
who are you?
agent mackelway?
i'm sorry basil i thought she was a man
yes
this is richard low stay on the phone do not disconnect i'm watching you i will instruct you where to drive
yes sir
dave koessler must have you jumping through hoops
i believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops
how's the arm?
i've been reading hearing about you i spoke to koessler professor daitz
he couldn't break an egg with a hammer he still writing those crime porn books?
he's moved on to tv
what was your weakness sir?
damn it man you're talking about my mother
i'm not sure exactly i had monsters on the brain i wanted to get these guys every one of them i got obsessive
suspect zero?
deputy director koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking highprofile failure better to get rid of me then he could be mr serial killer mr authority on deviant behavior  no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one richard low do you really think that plane crashed by accident? do you really think i wasn't on it by accident? i've always had a good sense of intuition
so you went underground?
was i afraid of dave koessler? not likely i told you i'd gotten a bit obsessive it was an opportunity to back off think things through  where's the file?
i don't carry it with me
you're a smart guy tell me what it says
hum a tune and i'll sing to it
it's my master list of missing persons: men boys girls children over the last ten years two hundred and eightyfive names a pool of possible victims
zero killed them all?
all right austin i think you should go
of course not they're possibles i've checked them against bureau records check them against your file how did you get it?
after my hiatus after i got my priorities readjusted i drifted online started tracking porn chat rooms looking for zero got accepted came across these boys swapping stories pictures downloads never found zero but i did come across some class a scumbags
how do you know who's real and who's not?
and who else did i find? agent thomas mackelway crackerjack fbi techie i was greatly disappointed when you were reassigned
you knew it was me all along?
there's someone out there mack i know some man killing for the fun of it sniffing human glue without regard to age or sex without predicable mo someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies you have access you can call up local authorities check morgues conduct interviews be my man
i already have an employer
if you won't do it for me do it for your cousin nadine right? the girl in the pink sweater
who told you about her?
you did you were with her when she disappeared right? she took you to the mall or the movies you turn around and she's gone
i think if everyone were honest they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag
it was the mall
i know you lionheart i watched your mind work heard your dirty thoughts 
we're alike we are hunters we have the gift it's ancient times all over again we stand between order and chaos i need help i can't carry on alone
maybe you should back off
this guy zero he drifts around that's how they all start drifting around their minds filling up with fantasies he thinks he's real smart laughs at us laughs at his victims but he has left a trail and the trail is somewhere in those names you know how to reach me  take my advice when dealing with these fbi tightasses go by the book that's what i did
you? you went by the book?
is he dead?
yeah
was it zero?
[fantasy time girls give it up give it up]
i'm leaving  oh and austin?
[reality very risky]
[lionheart what happened?]
[you want to talk lionheart or you want to take this a little more personal?]
lead the way murman
i've been to chicago
[not this way call it a little favor call it a little thing i'm going to do for you i'm going to make chicago come alive for you you'll owe me one]
if i owe i will go
[the address is 147 south rane it's a lively address you got a problem with dark meat?]
haven't had any but i'm willing to try
[if you wanted a good steak you should have gone to omaha]
yes basil?
let's talk about zero
[hello agent mackelway how's the watch? maybe you can do one of those tv commercials i found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking]
i want to help you
i've located the suspect zero file did you know there was one? koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation
[don't jerk a jerkoff there's nothing in the bureau mainframe]
not everything is imputed to memory the most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy why would the zero file be kept secret?
[you tell me]
george sheldon? the second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings the crime scene profile was never entered into vicap at whose request? david koessler
[what does the file say?]
i want to go live with you
ladder 20 was on the rock for training we stopped there so she could get cleaned up
be careful
[and i want to go back to needlepoint]
leave this room i'll go back with you blow your cover
good morning sir agent salinas sir
so you're the new meat?
yes sir
what did you do to end up here?
i believe it's in my file sir
johnny get this man's file mackelway right?
thomas mackelway
hot enough for you agent mackelway? hell's doorknob what they got you doing?
well austin you've stopped dr evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe and somehow you and agent kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair
updating the condition of all bureau owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir
"computer investigation and infrastructure assessment center" quantico out of mit  you're a techie?  okay you screwed up once so did half the guys here that's why they're here
i screwed up twice sir
i see that washington to philadelphia to here philly's a nice station how many agents?
four hundred and sixty sir
"attitude adjustment issues"  what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
i wished to be reinstated at computer crimes i was undiplomatic in my request
this is a first you criticized the deputy director to his face and you still have a badge? you must have some oneofakind skills  why don't you just quit? i mean you're not going to get promoted not wearing this jacket
i like working for the bureau sir i like catching bad guys it's all i care about
agent mackelway you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
i'd say that about sums it up exposition
yes sir
headed there now the same shift will be on at noon
this case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to washington your old boss is coming out
koessler?
no
"mydick?"
mydick as in my dick that was his screen name
i don't
eight nine months ago when i was at computer crime i got into a chat room with someone named mydick i'd talked to him before everything i saw yesterday everything in the autopsies it's identical the forensics are dead on mydick's fantasies involved a hogtie rig nylon cord torture with pliers rip the nipples  when the "item" screams she chokes he had a thing about eyes always the eyes  stab their eyes it's the same guy speck was mydick
speck is dead
congratulations field agent kensington
but why attack an agent?
how far is amarillo?
350 miles
locate a jet we're going to amarillo
excuse me agent mackelway?
i don't think you understand
what is it exactly i don't understand agent mackelway?
deputy director koessler doesn't want zero all he cares about is low
i'm agent thomas mackelway fbi there is no way you will escape assistant deputy director richard low is en route with another agent  you may know low by another name you may know him by the name murman i am lionheart
murman
here's the number of my dentist he's first rate ring him up he'll look after you
he's a brilliant man brilliant enough to catch you
you want to "profile" me? find out what makes me "tick"? write about me go on a talk show give me a nickname?
it's over for you
michael this is grandma i want to know if you got the part on that television program i told the whole family and they're very excited to know if  skipping message end of final message

you've been through worse
you're right i know
ever since i've known you
but wait i you got me again oh and austin
i don't know about that
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this
it didn't feel that way
that's because it was a challenge you has control over you're situation it was hard but you rose to it
okay i'll think about that bye
you really should life after all is really just a series of challenges
enough i've got to use the phone
are you calling her?
you should call your grandmother
don't do it mike
yes basil?
do you realize that i've been waiting for that call for six months and i cut her off?
how are you ladies doing this evening?
what do you drive?
i'm sorry?
what kind of car do you drive?
you like laughing at the misery of others?
thanks
i've seen you somewhere where have i seen you?

i know starbucks i served you an espresso at starbucks
are you sure? maybe
yes remember? you asked me for an application? i introduced you to the manager?
oh yeah boy that must've been a while ago
i'd say about two weeks

well thank you?
nikki
hi
hi
i'm mike
hi mike i'm lorraine
like the quiche?
yes like the quiche
i like quiche
are you more satisfied now sexually austin?
i thought real men don't like quiche
my reputation seems to have preceded me
why? you're not a real man?
so i thought what the hell they make movies in la not in michigan so i moved here
just like that?
well it wasn't the simple but yeah
how was it hard?
well i left someone very special behind
tell me about it
you too?
what do you mean 'cleaned up?'
well you can't always get what you want
yeah
i thought i was going to die
it's been six months and i'm just starting to get over it
oh god that's two more than me tell me it gets better
it does
how?
well it still sucks but you start to see that there are advantages to being single
like what?
what else?
what else? let's see you have complete freedom
"you can't always get what you want" that's a great title for a song i'm gonna write that and it'll be a big hit
to do what?
i don't know to grow to go out whatever you want
anything?
anything
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance? i can do that?
uh if the guy wants to
you don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
yes i mean no i mean maybe he would find her i mean you attractive maybe he doesn't like to dance maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either
maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song if that's what he's afraid of
no maybe that's not the case maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to
good on ya man
charles what's up man?
oh you know
did you um did you get that pilot?
no man i know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me it wasn't that funny anyway
and boy does it hurt when they ask
i don't even tell them about anything i'm close on anymore
not until you book it
and even then
you want to come with us to a party at the chateau marmont? they got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies
they're out of glenlivet
good afternoon mr powers i'm the destructacon 5000 i'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point you might as well surrender resistance is futile your odds of survival are 23763273 to
why don't i just wait three weeks and tell her i was cleaning out my wallet and found her number
then ask where you met her
hi
oh i'm sorry how'd your folks take it?
i haven't heard an official "no" yet
you haven't told then huh?
no
i'm considering taking a job as a "goofy"
i heard it took four days to light for that shot
i know what you're saying man i don't know what to tell you
well destructacon 5000 you have quite a head on your shoulders i dare to coin
hi boys we almost gave up on you
oh are we late? there are no clocks in this town
no no the worst was when i went in for this afterschool special and i'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids i see they're all signed in for the same role as me
they were auditioning for the same role as you?
it's like you looked at my tape you saw my picture why did you call me in? you knew i was twentyfour
let me just check on my boy
always
lisa works at the mgm grand
oh my god
the poor thing six years?
yes i am programmed to answer any question
and she's with someone else
he's so sweet he really said that?
i believe it too he really just wants her to be happy
a couple of high rollers like you?
could you believe it?
wait here i'll get you that martini
nah i didn't really want it anyway i just wanted to order it
can i get you something else? i mean you shouldn't leave without getting something for free
what do you guys do?
on the table
really? let me ask you this what is love?
sorry?
you have to lay it on the table
you're not allowed to hand me money sir you'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it
huh?
you want this in black chips
do you have anything smaller?
do you ever perform out here? i'd love to see you
no
you should a lot of comics play vegas
well i'm afraid it's not that easy
that does not compute
why not?
there are different circuits it's hard to explain you wouldn't understand
who's your booking agent?
oh? you know about booking agents i don't uh actually have a west coast agent as of yet
well who represents you back east?
actually it's funny you i'm actually uh between
i'm sure she'll call six years is a long time you don't just break it off cleanly after six years
i know but she did she's with someone else now
already? you poor thing it won't last
why not?
why not? it's a question
it's a rebound
we were a rebound and we lasted six years
yeah but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
can i check my messages? i have a calling card
sorry it's just that
you said there are advantages to being single i want to know what the advantages are
well this is it
listen i had a great time
me too
i would love to see you again sometime
what's wrong with your hand?
i'll be around
that's not good enough i want to make plans to see you
you're a comedian?
yeah and an actor
i'll have to come see you sometime
if and when i get a real gig i'll call you
it's not going to well?
when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sitcoms to standups at the airport i got off the plane in la six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan
didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
yeah but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into
i let her take a shower
i'm sorry baby i'm just not grocking your head space
neither is acting not if you're serious about it  can i have one of these?
why you like the duck with the cigar? 
yeah nice touch it's the logo from "you bet your life" right?
good eye not one club owner got it they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card
well i should be getting
it's really getting late
can i give you a ride to your car?
nah i'm right across the street
which one?
the red piece of shit over there
dr evil do you really expect them to pay?
well it suits you
hello?
hi mike?
lorraine?
are you on the other line?
yeah hold on
i can call back
hi sorry about that
you didn't have to get off the other line i would've called you back
hi lorraine thanks for holding on
i've got you dr evil
how's it going? it's been a while
six months
how are you doing?
fine i guess you?
good  i think about things
yeah?
yeah
what kind of things?
you know us
i thought you met someone else
well done mr powers we're not so different you and i it's true you're british and i'm belgian you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding you're thin i'm about forty pounds overweight ok we are different i'm not making a very good point however isn't it ironic mr powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be evil? maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
it doesn't matter i think about you every day
really?
i miss you mike
why didn't you call?
i couldn't do you know how hard it's been not to call you? i pick up the phone every night whenever that commercial comes on
the michelin commercial
yeah with the baby in the tire one time i started to cry right in front of pierre
pierre that's his name? pierre? is he french?
hi
i heard you might be moving back
no man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination we were innocent man if we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same  it's freedom man
yeah uh i don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon listen can i call you right back? i gotta take this call
i'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week can't you talk for five more minutes?
i really want to catch up with you but i've gotta take this call they're holding i'll talk with you when you get back in town bye
and what if i don't want to give up on her?
you don't call
but you said i shouldn't call if i wanted to give up on her
right
so i don't call either way
right
so what's the difference?
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of face it freedom failed
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back see you can't do anything to make her want to come back you can only do things to make her not want to come back
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her
right
well that sucks
it sucks
so it's almost a retroactive decision so i could like let's say forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her
right or more likely the opposite
right wait what do you mean?
i mean first you'll pretend not to care not call  whatever and then eventually you really won't care
unless she comes back first
that's why right now is a very groovy time man we still have freedom but we also have responsibility
ah see that's the thing somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore
there's the rub
there's the rub
thanks man sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time
hey man don't sweat it
it's just that you've been there your advice really helps
no problem
rob i just want you to know you're the only one i can talk to about her
i don't think i'm gonna take it
it's a gig
it seems the tables have turned again dr evil
i mean i need the money
you're an actor find the zen in the role
it's definitely a step back for me
look there's not much of a call for shakespeare in this town
there's just something about being "goofy" any other disney character would be fine there's just this stigma associated with the character
what do you want? you're tall
do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? i still haven't told them i didn't get the pilot
you tested over a month ago i'm sure they figured it out by now
haven't you noticed i didn't mention michelle once today?
i didn't want to say anything
not really kill the little bastard see what i care
why?
i don't know it's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter
what? like you didn't want to jinx it?
kinda
i don't talk about her that much
oh no?
i didn't mention her once today
the only reason i mentioned her at all is to say that i'm not going to talk about her anymore i thought you'd appreciate that
i do good for you man
you want to hit the town tonight?
mr powers my job is to acclimate you to the nineties you know a lot's changed since 1967
i shouldn't mike it's a weeknight
what do you have? a pluto call back?
how many strokes?
i don't know eight or nine
i'll give you an eight 
what'd you get?
an eight
so if the party starts at eight why are we first going to a bar at ten?
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven
oh  where is this place?
a shower?  did you take one too?
well as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the same time experimenting with mindexpanding drugs in a consequencefree environment i'll be sound as a pound
it's one of these for some reason cool bars in la have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front
that doesn't sound too good for business
it's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing it's kinda cool it's like you're in on some kind of secret you tell a chick you've been some place it's like bragging that you know how to find it the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there you have to have someone come before there is a direct line connecting you back to the original unequivocally cool club patrons it's kinda like judaism
sounds more like aids
kinda money huh?
i'll get a dewars rocks 
bud
i can't get over how cute the girls in this city are
i know it's like the opposite of inbreeding the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool
darwinism at its best
my mother's told me all about you
i've been around here six months and i still can't get over it
it's like every day i see a beautiful woman i'm not used to that i'm used to seeing a beautiful woman i don't know once a week i can't handle it
wait till summer i swear you can't leave the house it hurts it physically hurts
i can't wait till i actually get to touch one of them
ah there's the rub
charles and me went to network on this pilot together
i just tested for one
what's the big deal? everyone steals from everyone
what's that guy's name? sue?
sue his dad was big johnny cash fan
if it's a lie goddamn her it it's the truth goddamn me  god i hope that's witty how's your mum?
oh like that song
"a boy named sue" i think that's why he's such a bad cat
him?
there are so many beautiful women here
it's unbelievable
i got to at least try once
you're a better man than i am charlie brown
no i just promised myself i'd give it a try i gotta get out there sooner or later
i'm going in will you be my wing man?
thanks man
ok ok man don't get heavy i'll sign just to get things moving baby
you haven't been drinking have you?
sorry about what happened at the dresden i had no idea
you want to talk about it?
what's the point?
uuuuugh
oh boy
i'm such an asshole
i think i'm gonna move back east
well that's dumb
what's dumb about it?
listen mr powers i look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby you can address me as agent kensington we have to leave immediately we've preserved your private jet just as you left it it's waiting at heathrow airport
well you're doing so well
how am i doing well? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie big fuckin' deal i'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians how good am i doing?
at least you didn't get turned down for goofy
they turned you down?
see it's all how you look at it if your life sucks then mine is god awful i mean i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing you got in the union you got an agent i thought if you could make it maybe i could too
i didn't make it
then why won't she call?
because you left man she's got her own world to deal with in new york she was a sweet girl but fuck her you gotta move on you gotta let go of the past the future is so beautiful every day is so sunny out here it's like manifest destiny man i mean we made it what's past is prologue that which does not kill us makes us stronger all that shit you'll get over it
how did you get over it? i mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
you miss the pain?
pretty groovy jumbo jet eh? how does a hot chick like you end up working at the ministry of defense?
for the same reason you miss her you lived with it so long
wow  you wanna grab a bite?
by the way the guys back home said she put on some weight
you little bitch
you should play another team the kings are bitches in this game
it's kinda money actually
make someone bleed
pause it 
which means no one will get there 'til ten
what's he do?
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages i wanted to travel  see the world in my last year i was accepted into the mod in the cultural studies sector i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country it's very boring my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative

she was cute
he's a bitch he ain't gonna do nothing
you asshole why are you carrying a gun? what? in case someone steps to you snoop dogg?
yeah here it's easier to avoid trouble it's not like you like in compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day nobody's mugging you on no subway in new york the trouble finds you out here you gotta go look for it
you live in such a fantasy world
that's fascinating vanessa listen why don't we go into the back and shag?

what are you nuts? you think she's coming back?
i know she's coming back
i don't think so
baby did you hear her? "you shouldn't leave without getting something for free" she wants to party baby
you think so?
you gotta give tee one thing he's good with the ladies
i'm too tired for this let's just go
baby this is what we came for we met a beautiful baby and she likes you

chief  mind if i take her?

you gotta get that girl out of your head it's time to move on you're a stylish successful good looking cat the ladies want to love you you just gotta let them
that's bullshit
it's not you're money any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you
it's just that i've been out of the game so long trent i was with her for six years that's before aids i'm scared i don't know how to talk to them i don't know
you can't think like that baby it's hard i know i've been there not for six years but i know you just gotta get back out there
it's just tough after sleeping with someone you love for so long to be with someone new who doesn't know what i like and you gotta wear a jimmy
gotta
and then i'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend who i'm not even really attracted to
that was so fuckin' money it was like that "jedi mind" shit
do i make you horny?
that's what i'm telling you baby the babies love that stuff they don't want all that sensitive shit you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream they know what you want what do you think? you think they don't?
i know i know
they know what you want believe me pretending is just a waste of time you're gonna take them there eventually anyway don't apologize for it
i'm just trying to be a gentleman show some respect
nice baby
i should've said renaissance right? it went over her head
baby you did fine
"age of enlightenment" shit like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference how demeaning i may as well have just said "let me jump your ignorant bones"
baby
it's just i thought "renaissance" was too excaliber it's the wrong casino she would've gotten it though
what?
you did fine don't sweat her we're meeting our honeys soon you know christy's friend is going to be money
i hope so  we gotta go soon
baby relax it's just down the hall she's gotta change we'll be fine
we didn't do so bad after all
i'm mike  and this is my friend "doubledown trent"
whatever
oh a dorothy
what was the part?
oh "i love you i can't believe you're doing this drugs are bad" whatever afterschool bullshit the role is brother
"big brother" "little brother"?
do i make you horny? randy you know to you am i eros manifest?
wait wait just "brother" so i go in "hello hi we loved your guest spot on baywatch blah blah blah" whatever so i start to read and mikey i was money i prepared for a week it's a starring role i'm crying the casting director she starts crying
no
wait  she's crying i finish i hold up my finger like "wait a second" they sit in silence for like at least five minutes i look up and they all start clapping and now they're all crying even the camera guy
no not the camera guy
so give me the fuckin part

i don't know the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on does that makes me some kind of fag?
listen vanessa i'm a swinger that's what i do i swing
no baby you're money

she thought you were money
i don't think so
i heard them talking they both thought you were money

baby you take yourself out of the game you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream of course it's gonna be on the friend tip
i just don't think she liked me in that way

one fiftynine two minutes
two vodka martinis straight up shaken not stirred very dry easy on the water
a limousine has just pulled up
beautiful what time are you off  christy?
and you?
i'll have the blackbeard over easy
yes i understand  i'm listening
anythinganything the godfather wishes
good  he never doubted you
the don himself is coming to me tonight?
this is tom hagen; i'm calling for don corleone at his request
yes i understand i'm listening
bonasera we know each other for years but this is the first time you come to me for help  i don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffeeeven though our wives are friends
hello hello that's dr evil's cat
what do you want of me?  i'll give you anything you want but do what i ask
no  you ask for too much
i ask for justice
the court gave you justice
an eye for an eye
but your daughter is still alive
you never think to protect yourself with real friends  you think it's enough to be an american  all right the police protects you there are courts of law so you don't need a friend like me but now you come to me and say don corleone you must give me justice and you don't ask in respect or friendship  and you don't think to call me godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murderfor money
america has been good to me
be my friend
good  from me you'll get justice
bianca i need to talk to you  i need to tell you 
what was i supposed to do?  the guy tried to mug me  i was gonna send a cop back  i just forgot
how do you know?
godfather
what do you wish me to do?
understood  i just wish i was doing more to help out
jesus conniesure mike
godfather
you fingered sonny for the barzini people  that little farce you played out with my sister  did barzini kid you that would fool a corleone?
i swear i'm innocent  i swear on the head of my children i'm innocent  mike don't do this to me please mike don't do this to me
don't be frightened  do you think i'd make my sister a widow?  do you think i'd make your children fatherless?  after all i'm godfather to your son  no your punishment is that you're out of the family business  i'm putting you on a plane to vegasand i want you to stay there  i'll send connie an allowance that's all but don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry  who approached you tattaglia or barzini?
barzini
what's the matter carlo?
let's go get him
what was that?
you're staying home  you're not going out
the food is on the table
i'm not hungry yet
eat it it's on the table
ba fa goulle
you filthy guinea spoiled brat clean it up or i'll kick your head in
you heard about your father?
yeah
the word is out in the streets that he's dead
he's too wellprotected right now
where the hell was paulie why wasn't he with the don?
paulie's been a little sick all winterhe was home
how many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
maybe three four times  i always asked freddie if he wanted another bodyguard but he said no  things have been so smooth the last ten years
go get paulie i don't care how sick he is  pick him up yourself and bring him to my father's house
that's all?  don't you want me to send some people over here?
clemenza  you take care of paulie i don't ever want to see him again understood?
understood
you take care of paulie?
sollozzo knows mike's a civilian
we can't just sit here austin
i want somebody very good very safe to plant that gun  i don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand
the gun will be there
you're on kidi'll square it with mom your not seeing her before you left  and i'll get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right
mostly it gives witnesses an excuse to change their identification when we make them see the light  then you take a long vacation and we catch the hell
how bad will it be?
we gotta fight sometime  let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength
he's going to be our lawyer in vegas  nobody goes to him with any other business as of now this minute  no reflection on tom; that's the way i want it  besides if i ever need any advice who's a better consigliere than my father
then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
you look terrif on the floor
i tol' you to stay put paulie
let me tell you a story there's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below the young bull says 'hey why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?' and the wise old bull replies 'no why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
outside
i'll think about it
good for ten men
you think we'll go for that last place?
maybe or you gotta know now
my business is heroin i have poppy fields laboratories in narseilles and sicily ready to go into production  my importing methods are as safe as these things can be about five per cent loss  the risk is nothing the profits enormous
why do you come to me?  why do i deserve your generosity?
i need two million dollars in cashmore important i need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested they would get only light sentences  be my friend
what percentages for my family?
thirty per cent  in the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up
i don't get it
my compliments  i'll take care of them from my share
so  i receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection  no worries about operations is that what you tell me?
nohow a man makes his living is none of my business  but this proposition of yours is too risky all the people in my family lived well the last ten years i won't risk that out of greed
are you worried about security for your million?
no
i kept trying to call you after my divorce and tom always said you were busy  when i got the wedding invitation i knew you weren't sore at me anymore godfather
can i do something for you still? you're not too rich or too famous that i can't help you?
all right hollywoodnow tell me about this hollywood pezzonovanta who won't let you work
you take care of your family?
you look terrible  i want you to eat well to rest  and spend time with your family  and then at the end of the month this big shot will give you the part you want
well you know cows and shagging
it's too late  all the contracts have been signed they're almost ready to shoot
is it necessary?
i'm sure it's the most generous gift today
he's his own boss and very competent
and with prison record
two terms; one in italy one in the united states  he's known to the government as a top narcotics man that could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify
when did he call?
this morning
it is johnny  he came all the way from california to be at the wedding
should i bring him in
unfortunately while you told that stupid story dr evil has escaped
no  let the people enjoy him  you see?  he is a good godson
when does my daughter leave with her bridegroom?
they'll cut the cake in a few minutesleave right after that your new soninlaw do we give him something important?
no give him a living  but never let him know the family's business what else tom?
what is this nonsense?
my wife was weeping before she fell asleep outside my window i saw my caporegimes to the house and it is midnight  so consigliere of mine i think you should tell your don what everyone knows
i didn't tell mama anything  i was about to come up and wake you and tell you  just now
but you needed a drink first
yes
when i meet with tattaglia's people; should i insist that all his drug middlemen be clean?
i hate having my picture taken
mention it don't insist  barzini is a man who will know that without being told
you mean tattaglia
barzini
he was the one behind sollozzo?
tom i never thought you were a bad consigliere i thought santino a bad don rest in peace  he had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune  michael has all my confidence as you do  for reasons which you can't know you must have no part in what will happen
will your girl friend get back to the city all right?
what was this for?
for bravery
and this?
for killing a man
fancy a nibble?
what miracles you do for strangers
i fought for my country  it was my choice
and now what do you choose to do?
i'm going to finish school
have you thought about a wife?  a family?
no
i understand michael  but you must make a family you know
i want children i want a family but i don't know when
accept what's happened michael
i could accept everything that's happened; i could accept it but that i never had a choice  from the time i was born you had laid this all out for me
forgot?  you handcuffed a civilian to a tree?
watch out you're on my hair
no i wanted other things for you
you wanted me to be your son
yes but sons who would be professors scientists musiciansand grandchildren who could be who knows a governor a president even nothing's impossible here in america
then why have i become a man like you?
you are like me we refuse to be fools to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men  i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over  that was my misfortune  that was your misfortune  i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was  i had no choice
a man has to choose what he will be i believe that
i told you that it wouldn't escape his eye
i see you have your luca brasi
i'll need him
barzini will move against you first
sorry move your hand to the left there you go gorgeous
how?
your wife and childrenyou're happy with them?
yes
a fine boy from sicily captured by the american army and sent to new jersey as a prisoner of war
nazorine my friend tell me what i can do
now that the war is over enzo this boy is being repatriated to italy  and you see godfather  hemy daughterthey
you want him to stay in this country
godfather you understand everything
tom what we need is an act of congress to allow enzo to become a citizen
don tommassino
i haven't had fun like that since college
michael why must you do this  we have been lucky so far all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret  it is from love for your father that i've asked you never to more than an hour from the villa
calo and fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen
you must understand that your father's enemies have friends in palermo
i know
where are you going?
corleone
there is nothing there  not anymore
i was told that my grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old
long ago  now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettasthe others escaped to america
that is your birthrightbut michael use this car
i'm sorry
things went badly in palermo?
the younger men have no respect things are changing; i don't know what will happen  michael because of the wedding people now know your name
is that why there are more men on the walls?
even so i don't think it is safe here anymore  i've made plans to move you to a villa near siracuse you must go right away
what is it?
you tell us about america
how do you know i come from america?
we hear  we were told you were a pezzonovantabig shot
only the son of a pezzonovanta
hey america  is she as rich as they say?
why?
yes
hey beautiful girls
get the car  i'll be leaving in ten minutes  where's calo?
calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen  is your wife coming with you?
you had better bring a few bottles home with you my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight 
this one could seduce the devil  a body and eyes as big and black as olives
i know about what you mean
this was a beauty  right calo?
beautiful all over eh?
it's the real thunderbolt then
always wanting to have fun that's you in a nutshell
why didn't moe green meet us at the airport?
you look wonderful kid; really wonderful  that doctor did some job on your face
ever seen anything like that before?
mike  the party starting
who are those girls?
that's for you to find out
give them some money and send them home
mike
mike you sure about moe selling he never mentioned it to me and he loves the business
tom you're the consigliere; you can talk to the don and advise him
you're smashed vanessa
the old man wants you; johnny's herehe's got a problem
is the hospital covered?
what about luca?  sollozzo didn't seem worried about luca  that worries me
if luca sold out we're in real trouble
has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
no and i've been calling all night maybe he's shacked up
tom you're the consigliere what do we do if the old man dies?
without your father's political contacts and personal influence the corleone family loses half its strength  without your father the other new york families might wind up supporting sollozzo and the tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war  the old days are over this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore  if your father diesmake the deal sonny
that's easy to say; it's not your father
i was as good a son to him as you or mike
i am not
oh christ tom i didn't mean it that way
we're all tired
maybe mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly  you know the old man doesn't want that
was there a definite proposal?
sure he wants us to send mike to meet him to hear his proposition the promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse
what about that tattaglias?  what will they do about bruno?
part of the deal: bruno cancels out what they did to my father
we should hear what they have to say
no no consiglere  not this time no more meetings no more discussions no more sollozzo tricks  give them one message: i want sollozzo  if not it's all out war  we go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street
the other families won't sit still for all out war
oh yes you are
then they hand me sollozzo
come on sonny your father wouldn't want to hear this  this is not a personal thing this is business
and when they shot me father
yes even the shooting of your father was business not personal
i found out about this captain mccluskey who broke mike's jaw he's definitely on sollozzo's payroll and for big money mccluskey's agreed to be the turk's bodyguard  what you have to understand is that while sollozzo is guarded like this he's invulnerable  nobody has ever gunned down a new york police captain  never  it would be disastrous  all the five families would come after you sonny; the corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover  so justtake that into consideration
one of tattaglia's people?
jesus i don't know
pop they hit us and we hit them back
we'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks  i want to get things going good before he gets better  what's the matter with you?
you start operating the five families will start their raids again  we're at a stalemate sonny your war is costing us a lot of money
i can't you're drunk
no more stalemate tom we got the soldiers we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it they know me for what i am tom and they're scared of me
yes  that's true you're getting a hell of a reputation
kay we weren't expecting you  you should call
i've tried calling and writing  i want to reach michael
what was that?
an accident  no one was hurt
will you give this to him
will you give this letter to michael
sonny was hot for my deal right? you know it's the smart thing to do too  i want you to talk sonny into it
the don was slipping; in the old days i could never have gotten to him  now he's dead nothing can bring him back  talk to sonny talk to the caporegimes clemenza and tessioit's good business
chief  i know i screwed up  but this guy was no innocent civilian
it's not that i'm drunk i'm just beginning to see what my mum was talking about  what was my mother like back in the sixties? i'm dying to know
even sonny won't be able to call off luca brasi
i'll worry about luca  you take care of sonny and the other two kids
i'll tryit's what the don would want us to do
mr corleone is johnny's godfather that is very close a very sacred religious relationship
okay but just tell him this is one favor i can't give  but he should try me again on anything else
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first understood?
you smooth son of a bitch let me lay it on the line for you and your boss  johnny fontane never gets that movie  i don't care how many dago guinea wop greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork
i'm germanirish
hello kay  your father's inside doing some business  he's been asking for you
sure  anything i can do for you
really austin
no  i guess i'll see you christmas everyone's going to be out at long beach right?
what about mccluskey?
mike why are you cutting me out of the action?
tom we're going to be legitimate all the way and you're the legal man  what could be more important than that
bookkeepers know everything rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing  they get a little more money than the job's worth  lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly
not so perfectly if you noticed
mike why am i out?
you're not a wartime consigliere things may get tough with the move we're trying
christ tom; i needed more time with him  i really needed him
did he give you his politicians?
austin may i have a word with you?
not alli needed another four months and i would have had them all  i guess you've figured it all out?
how will they come at you?
i know now  i'll make them call me don
have you agreed on a meeting?
i've never seen anything like it
michael what are those men doing?
they're waiting to see my father
they're talking to themselves
they're going to talk to my father which means they're going to ask him for something which means they better get it right
why do they bother him on a day like this?
of course luv
no  his name is luca brasi  you wouldn't like him
who is he?
you really want to know?
yes  tell me
you like spaghetti?
you know i love spaghetti
once upon a time about fifteen years ago some people wanted to take over my father's olive oil business  they had al capone send some men in from chicago to kill my father and they almost did
al capone
my father sent luca brasi after them  he tied the two capone men hand and foot and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths then he took an ax and chopped one man's feet off
michael
listen i know i'm just being neurotic but i can't shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary ms fagina i mean i don't want to sound paranoid but i've had some bad relationships in the past and i have some jealousy issues you went to her penthouse it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities but i can't help but feel this weird irrational unfocused well jealousy i'm sorry
then the legs at the knees
michael you're trying to scare me
then the thighs where they joined the torso
michael i don't want to hear anymore
then luca turned to the other man
michael i love you
i never know when you're telling me the truth
i told you you wouldn't like him
tomtom i'd like you to meet kay adams
how do you do
don't be sorry you're right to be suspicious i shagged her i shagged her rotten
if he's your brother why does he have a different name?
i didn't know your family knew johnny fontane
sure
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off
we have something for your mother for sonny we have the tie for fredo and tom hagen gets the reynolds pen
and what do you want for christmas?
what will your father say?
as long as i tell him beforehand he won't object  he'll be hurt but he won't object
what time do they expect us?
for dinner  unless i call and tell them we're still in new hampshire
i can't believe you made love to her just like that did you use protection?
michael
michael what are you doing?
shhh you be the long distance operator  here
would you like me better if i were a nun?
no
michael?
i'm thinking about it
michael
hello  kay?
how is your father?
of course i had my ninemillimeter automatic
he'll be ok
i love you
yeah kay i'm here
can you say it?
huh?
i can't
please say it
look  i'll see you tonight ok?
visiting hour ends at eight thirty i'll just sit with him; i want to show respect
can i go to the hospital with you?
no did you use a condom?
i don't think so  you don't want to end up on page 3 of the daily news
my parents don't read the daily news  all right if you think i shouldn't  i can't believe the things the papers are printing i'm sure most of it's not true
i don't think so either  i better go
when will i see you again?
when will i see you again?
i have to see my father and his people when we get back to the mall
oh michael
we'll go to the show tomorrow nightwe can change the tickets
don't you want dinner first?
no you eatdon't wait up for me
only sailors use condoms man
your sister wants to ask you something
why are you so cold to her and carlo?  they live with us on the mall now but you never get close to them
i'm busy
will you?
michael it's not true  please tell me
don't ask me
tell me
all right this one time i'll let you ask about my affairs one last time
i'm michael corleonethis is my father  what happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
oh your father just had too many visitors  it interfered with the hospital service  the police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago  but don't worry  i look in on him
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine
not in the nineties
you cannot stay herei'm sorry
you and i are going to move my father right nowto another room on another floorcan you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
absolutely not  we have to get permission from the doctor
you've read about my father in the papers  you've seen that no one's here to guard him  now i've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him  believe me and help me
i was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town
how's mom?
good  she's been through it before me too  you were too young to know about it  you better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear
i can help you out
oh no you can't the old man'd be sore as hell if i let you get mixed up in this
jesus christ he's my father sonny
well they should filthy beggars they go from port to port  alotta meant nothing to me
all right mikeywho do we have to hit clemenza or paulie?
what?
clemenza?  no i don't believe it
you're right kid clemenza is okay it was paulie
how can you be sure?
is it going to be allout war like last time?
until the old man tells me different
then wait sonny  talk to pop
sollozzo is a dead man i don't care what it costs  i don't care if we have to fight all the five families in new york  the tattaglia family's going to eat dirt  i don't care if we all go down together
that's not how pop would have played it
well it means something to me if you want us to have a relationship you've got to be a onewoman man
i know i'm not the man he was  but i'll tell you this and he'll tell you too  when it comes to real action i can operate as good as anybody short range
all right sonny  all right
christ if i could only contact luca
where are you going?
to the city
send some bodyguards
sonnysonnyjesus christ i'm down at the hospital  i came down late  there's no one here  none of tessio's peopleno detectives no one  the old man is completely unprotected
all right get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside i'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes  sit tight and don't panic
mikey you look beautiful
cut it out
it was just a shag vanessa you're everything to me
we can't wait  no matter what sollozzo say about a deal he's figuring out how to kill pop  you have to get sollozzo now
go on mike
why don't you stop living like a bum and get this place cleaned up
what are you inspecting the barracks?  you ready?  did clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
a million times
ok  how long do you think before i can come back?
i'm glad you came mike  i hope we can straighten everything out  all this is terrible it's not the way i wanted things to happen at all it should never have happened
i want to settle things tonight  i want my father left alone
we're going to new jersey?
most importanti want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life

yeah i can't believe liberace was gay women loved him man i didn't see that one coming
you're unlucky
you goddamn dagos  i do you a favor and take freddie in when you're having a bad time and then you try to push me out
you took freddie in because the corleone family bankrolled your casino  you and the corleone family are evened out  this is for business; name your price
the corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore  the godfather is sick  you're getting chased out of new york by barzini and the other families and you think you can find easier pickings here  i've talked to barzini; i can make a deal with him and keep my hotel

i love jazz
bird ask me the name of my sailboat 
austin we don't look anything like our photo badges
i don't know what's the name of your sailboat?
good afternoon
what time is it?  oh god do you always type your letters?  that should be two ts
i can't write and i can't spell that's the privilege of a firstclass education you're upstairs at the back i think ermelinda made the bed up
this is so good of you
you're a dark horse ripley engaged?
your parents met her
i'm doing this wrong aren't i?
could we sail to venice?
sure i love venice
thank god austin we made it
i have to go to venice
see venice and die isn't that right? or is it rome? you do something and die don't you? okay venice is on the list
and rome
you're breaking my ribs
what?
i could fuck this icebox i love it so much  what were you actually doing in new york?
i played piano in a few places
that's one job you told me a lot of jobs
a few places  that's a few jobs anyway i don't want to think about new york
the mysterious mr ripley marge and i spend hours speculating  cold beer thank you dad
does that make you horny?
i love the fact you brought shakespeare with you and no clothes ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night is that true?
no i've got more than one shirt
she can do that stuff for you anyway just wear some of my things wear anything you want most of it's ancient 
without the glasses you're not even ugly  i don't need them because i never read how do i look
i know i write like a child
pretty vile see this: the s and the t do you see?  fine vulnerable  that's pain that's secret pain
it must be a deep secret cause i don't know about it
your handwriting  nothing more naked see  nothing's quite touching the line  that's vanity
do you have any brothers?
no no brothers no sisters
first i plan to soil myself then i plan to regroup and think about the next move any thoughts?
means we never shared a bath i'm cold can i get in?
no
i didn't mean with you in it
what does he say?
he's getting impatient he wants me to reassure him you'll be home by thanksgiving
you've got to get a new jacket really you must be sick of the same clothes i'm sick of seeing you in them
i can't i can't keep spending your father's money
where do we find a carozza for the forum or can we hire any of them  ?
relax
it's just there's so much to do in a single day
all right i get it i have bad teeth you have to understand in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth it didn't matter
relax the most important question is where to eat i hope freddie made a reservation
freddie?
look tom we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of freddie's the best thing is  if you want to be a tourist  grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station
what club?
freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd come if you want but i thought you wanted to see the forum?
shoes too?
you said i could pick out a jacket and i just sorry
get undressed in your own room would you?
i thought you'd missed the train
freddie drove me back in his car
no no no we'll use the floss to get to the ledge
is freddie here?
he's downstairs
what's the fight about? that's her fiancee isn't it? are they blaming him?
she was pregnant did you know that? do you know what that means in a place like this?
i'm prepared to take the blame
what are you talking about?
you've been so good to me you're the brother i never had i'm the brother you never had
she came to me for help she needed money and i didn't help her i didn't help her now she's dead and it's my fault
the thousand dollars of course was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing dickie home naturally i hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way
you can't blame him you could hardly expect this to go on forever
how are you going to fight this?  maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight  you'd have the good to weight against the bad it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do  gimme your shield
not a good time to lose one's head
i thought you might write again now that we're brothers
i can't how can i in all decency? we've had a good run haven't we?
what about venice? can we stick to that plan at least?
to mongibello and the happiest days of my life
to mongi you're cheerful tonight
i'm suddenly quite happy to be going back
that's good
i've got plans
ripley's plans
esatto i'm always planning
indeed
did i know you at princeton tom? i didn't did i?
why are you asking all of a sudden?
no reason because you're leaving i guess i don't think you were there were you?
why?
i mean it as a compliment you've got such great taste i don't know most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste used to say the cream of america: rich and thick freddie's the perfect example
then i'll take it as a compliment
i knew it i had a bet with marge
ha
do you even like jazz  or was that something for my benefit?
i'm thinking of giving up the sax what do you think about drums?
that's not the way to get ahead in life
what?
i wanted to tell you my plan
so tell me
i thought i might come back in the new year under my own steam
really? to italy?
of course let's say for argument's sake you were here  perhaps we could split the rent on a house  i'll get a job  or better still i could get a place in rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here 
oh god i don't think so
you see particularly with the marge problem you can just blame me
marge and i are getting married
how?
yes
how?
yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace today you're getting married it's absurd
i love marge
you love me and you're not marrying me
tom i don't love you
no no it's not a threat i've explained all of that
what?
you can be a leech  you know this  and it's boring you can be quite boring
the funny thing  i'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are i'm absolutely honest with you i've told you my feelings but you first of all i know there's something  that evening when we played chess for instance it was obvious 
what evening?
it's a shame he wasn't more headstrong
frederico
this is tom ripley freddie miles
dick  you've got to hear this
come on frederico do you really have to go back? at least stick around for the festival of the madonna
do you think you can steer this thing?
sure
just point her at capri and avoid the rocks
what are you doing?
margemaintenance
hello?
shut up
dickie?
who is it?
hello freddie it's tom tom ripley
oh hello where's dickie? how are you?
yes i'm good thank you dickies at dinner he's at otello's do you know it?
i don't think he's at dinner at 630pm if you said he was still at lunch i'd believe you incredible the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth
i guess
the landlady  as far as i could tell the landlady said he was here right now
he's gone to dinner search the place i can't think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you
because he's been hiding from me  what happened at christmas?
what do we do now?
what about christmas?
of course he's been very involved in his music hasn't he? i think his theory is you know you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly
which is horseshit have you heard him play that thing?  he can't
how did you find him? it's such an out of the way apartment can i fix you a drink?
no no i'm staying here for a few days in rome that's a new piano so you prob 
you should watch that
in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you
hardly
freddie do you have something to say?
what? i think i'm saying it something's going on he's either converted to christianity  or to something else
we've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag  you go get help i'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself otello's is on delle croce just off the corso
most enjoyable herbert greenleaf
tom ripley thank you sir
could you ever conceive of going to italy tom persuade my son to come home?  i'd pay you i'd pay you 1000 dollars
i've always wanted to go to europe sir but
mr greenleaf
tom how are you? you look well
i'm well thank you
far cry from new york
yes it is
i'm not going anywhere we're a team
yes what's the detective hoping to find in san remo?
he's being thorough that's all i'm learning about my son tom now he's missing i'm learning a great deal about him i hope you can fill in some more blanks for me marge has been good enough to do that about mongibello
no marge doesn't know the half of it
i think it might hurt her to know
and his passport photo? did you hear? to scratch out your own face like that  can you imagine  the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  i've thought about going to the police but i can't face it i can't face anything anymore
i feel guilty i feel like i pushed him away i spoke and he heard you
tom
hello sir  marge you should have waited didn't peter tell you i'd come by and pick you up?
marge has been telling us about the rings
you know i feel ridiculous i didn't mention them yesterday  i clean forgot  ridiculous
too right youth that's why i need you to lead the troops
i'm going to take marge for a little walk tom mr maccarron wants to talk with you
we could go down to the bar  no need for you to 
pretty good sticking with hot water
where's mr maccarron?
this theory the letter he left for you the police think that's a clear indication he was planning on doing something to himself
i just don't believe that
you don't want to dear i'd like to talk to tom alone  perhaps this afternoon? would you mind? marge what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow 
such as?
i don't know i don't know i just know it
thanks so much for inviting me tonight
but chief?  over this??
i'll hurry back
can you bear it? we hear you're a friend of freddie's  he has i hate opera tattooed on his chest
there's room for a whole libretto on freddie's chest
i was sure we'd met weren't you ted? this is herbert greenleaf's boy
thanks yes i think we did
is mr greenleaf here?
i could probably see my bedroom from here i can see my house when you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream isn't it?
i don't care for bs i don't care to hear it i don't care to speak it
okay
mr greenleaf appreciates your loyalty he really does marge she's got a hundred theories but there are a few things she doesn't know we hope she never knows
i hope she never knows
listen vanessa whatever happens i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden i don't know what happened the whole time i was shagging her i mean really shagging her i mean it was crazy i was like a huge mechanical piston in and out in and out
pleasure to meet you dickie's made a fine catch i know emily thinks so
you were right about the telephones there are no lines there's some problem
hello tom you're off? what are your plans?
i never said that
which is ridiculous boats are female everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man
dickie you can't even drive a car no what we need urgently is an icebox what do you think tom? agree with me and i'll be your friend for life
that ring's so great the green one
tom i love you  see  i bought it for him for his birthday
i have to find a birthday present for frances perhaps you can help me?
you really should go in it's marvelous
austin what's your point?
are you okay?
the thing with dickie  it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious then he forgets you and it's very very cold
so i'm learning
tell me why is it when men play they always play at killing each other? i'm sorry about cortina by the way
what about cortina?
dickie
i'll go and see what's the matter
hello marge
tom you startled me you're back
how are you? sorry is your book going well?
anyways what i'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a onewoman man well that's just groovy because i love you
yes  i'm on a good streak thanks
i was just looking at you   so quiet
where's dickie?
i think he's planning on staying in rome for a few days
ha did he say why?
i don't know i don't understand dickie marge so your guess is as good as mine
what does that mean?
well one day i'm invited skiing the next day i'm not one day we're all one family the next day he wants to be alone you tell me
is that what he said  he wanted to be alone?
thanks he knows i love this although why it couldn't have waited
it's not what it looks like vanessa  at ease boys
errand number one  deliver marge's perfume errand number two pack some clothes and his precious saxophone
how long's he staying for?
he hates being confronted
oh my god tom
marge how are you? what are you doing in rome?
is he here? are you with dickie?
is he really not here?
marge you know dickie has i hate opera tattooed on his chest
dickie was at the opera last night
i don't believe it wild horses wouldn't drag dickie to 
likewise
he was there with someone so i suppose she must have dragged him  that's not fair i'm going back to mongi i think dickie's coming home  i'm going to go home
did he kill freddie?
marge when did you get here?
tell me the truth did he kill freddie?
i'd swear he didn't of course he didn't
i tried again waiting here watching for him instead it's you whenever i look for dickie i find you  what happened to your face?
dickie did it
dickie?
my face there was an argument i said some things i shouldn't have about you about the appalling way he's treating you all of us and the next thing i know he's launched himself at me  are you getting on?
what?
i can explain they attacked me gas came out of herwell and then they and i
where does dickie live?
we passed it a few blocks back where the police were the palazzo gioia they don't even know i'm in rome and i'm not going to incriminate dickie 
perhaps i shouldn't go either
hello peter so good to see you
hello marge
i was looking forward to seeing him
dickie hasn't killed himself i'm sure of that there's a private detective on the case now  a mr maccarron  dickie's father's employing him
that's a terrific idea
look at me what?
very
i believe you austin let's go
did dickie's dad go?
he's having an early night
tom?
marge i'm in the bath won't be long
i found dickie's rings
what?
you've got dickie's rings
dickie promised me he would never take off this ring
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this
i have to tell mr greenleaf i have to tell mr greenleaf i have to tell mr greenleaf
follow me we're going to have to jump over the rail
marge calm down you're being hysterical
he promised me i swear i'll never take off this ring until the day 
marge? where are you going?
i was looking for a needle and thread i wasn't snooping i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra
today for the first time i've even wondered whether he might have killed freddie he would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him  well you know that marge i loved you  you might as well know  i loved you and because he knew i loved you he let you think i loved him didn't you see couldn't you see? i don't know maybe it's grotesque to say this now so just write it on a piece of paper or something and keep it in your purse for a rainy day tom loves me
i told you he gave them to me
why? when?
i feel as if you haven't heard anything i've been saying to you
i don't believe you
it's all true
are you crazy?
but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse for a rainy day
what are you going to do now tom?
i don't know peter has a concert in athens next month  and he's asked if i want to go along help out he says goodbye by the way  he's in rehearsal otherwise 
why do i think there's never been a ripley rainy day?
what?
i know it was you  i know it was you tom i know it was you i know you killed dickie i know it was you
dickie? do you know dickie?
you were at the opera? well that explains  yes i was there i was there with dickie
i told you i knew it
marge i don't know you so i have no right but dickie loves you he's  i think you'll find he's coming home to you
don't you guys understand?  it's all about image  the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime
austin i'm coming with you
how would you know that?
peter smithkingsley i've heard about you of course  from marge and dickie
look there's meredith thingy  who's that marge?  they're in textiles meredith   god how awful i've spent christmas in her house
no we're meeting another friend tom ripley
we think he's had a change of heart  so we should be celebrating
i hope so
so you found peter
where's dickie's father?
is this you?
no it's tom's splendid eh?
i'm going it alone this time vanessa i have a followup visit with the evil doctor
this is spectacular
that's why tom wanted you to stay it's better than squeezing into my room and i know how you hate hotels
what's funny?
what's your secret?
excuse me?
i'm meredith by the way meredith randall
dickie dickie greenleaf hello
you're not the shipping greenleaf's?
trying not to be trying to jump ship

i have something to tell you
my father wants me in new york he builds boats i'd rather sail them i travel under my mother's name
which is?
emily  just kidding

randall
but you're going skiing with us yankees aren't you?
what?
at christmas to cortina with freddie miles and 
lay it on me
how did you know that?
everybody knows freddie miles
is freddie in rome?
now? i don't think so but i've met him of course and we've chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r
i've left marge meredith and mongi so the rat's here now in rome
sorry i wouldn't have made a joke if 
the truth is if you've had money your entire life even if you despise it which we do  agreed?  you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it
i know
show me the other one again  i like them both
let's go
i love you austin
i thought you were enjoying yourself?
let's take a carozza and look at the moon
c'mon i need to talk to you just the two of us
don't worry really don't worry
you're such a pal to understand it's as if marge is here now  i look at you and i see her face  and i can't whatever i'm feeling towards you  i just can't
no i absolutely understand of course
otherwise you'd be fighting me off
will you meet me tomorrow? just to say goodbye in the daylight properly? so it's not just this it's too you should always save pain for daylight
oh meredith i'm sorry of course i'll meet you let's have coffee in the morning at dinelli's
i don't  is that by the spanish steps?
that's fab because i love you too vanessa
dickie my god
hello meredith
i was looking at you your clothes i wouldn't have known you
well you've spotted me and so you get the reward
what?
just kidding are you alone?
of course aunt joan
and co a lot of co oh god i've thought about you so much
when i thought about you i was mostly hating you where've you been hiding?
i haven't been hiding i've been in police custody they've been trying to flush out freddie's killer
kiss me
you're kidding
they're letting me have this vacation which is why the getup which is why you haven't heard from me
you know the whole world thinks you killed freddie? it's terrible
so  are you travelling under r?
you know what  i am
dickie are you with peter smith kingsley? i bet you are my aunt thought she saw him
ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor greenleaf il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor miles
he's taken over the case because they're annoyed the previous chap let dickie disappear when he was the only he was the only suspect in freddie's murder
dove e stato il signor ripley da allora?
all'aperto? col freddo che ha fatto?
danger powers personal effects
he thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside
il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private 
a ragione a ragione 
questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor richard greenleaf a roma
ditto
yes what happened? i heard you were desperate to come i was looking forward to rowing you around
i am i really am and i've been travelling i just can't seem to get that far north
well hurry before we sink  should i give you my telephone number in venice?
will we see you later?
actually my name's austin powers
i can't later
and tomorrow?
tomorrow's possible do you know dinelli's? piazza di spagna?
i know the piazza di spagna what time?
ten thirty?
we'll be there
sorry sorry had to renew my papers italian bureaucracy  never one stamp when they can make you line up for three have you been waiting long?
not at all morning tom
my god
but the point is dickie  well we know this  dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses
it says here name danger powers
peter i'm really sorry to put you through this i just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my italian's so rotten
don't be daft it's fine i'm delighted you finally made it to venice i'm delighted contrary to rumour you're still in one piece?
what rumour?
welcome to venice this place reeks doesn't it? can you smell it? ugh sorry not the best way to spend your first day
it's okay
anyway i've got to the bottom of the delay finally we're waiting for someone from rome
what do you mean? they're sending someone from rome?
that's good isn't it?
no but i thought that didn't happen in italy that each region was completely separate i was sure that was the 
you've seen the papers you know what a big deal it's been here american tourist murdered 
yeah right
danger's my middle name
in rome about three weeks ago  i knew that one
i've been backpacking
no
he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf?
no i did not i did not kill freddie miles and then kill dickie greenleaf is he accusing me?  ask him if he's accusing me
he's already angry i don't think 
can you imagine if dickie did kill freddie what must that be like? to wake up every morning how can you? just wake up and be a person drink a coffee?
whatever you do however terrible however hurtful  it all makes sense doesn't it? inside your head you never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel
but you're still tormented you must be you've killed somebody

one credit card receipt for swedish made penis enlarger pump signed austin powers

meredith logue you were kissing somebody looked like meredith

dickie and peter that's just too good gossip isn't it?
or tom and peter even
well that would be even better gossip
i'm telling you baby that's not mine

i know i'm lost too i'm going to be stuck in the basement aren't i that's my that's my  terrible and alone and dark  and i've lied about who i am and where i am and so nobody can ever find me

i suppose i always thought  better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody
what are you talking about  you're not a nobody that's the last thing you are
peter i i
and don't forget i have the key
good things about tom ripley? could take some time tom is talented tom is tender tom is beautiful
you're such a liar
dickie greenleaf?
one warranty card for swedishmade penis enlarger pump filled out by austin powers
yes?
it's a terrible shock eh? what time did signor miles leave yesterday?
i can't be absolutely sure  8? 9? we'd both taken on far too many drinks  but it was dark it was certainly dark when i walked him down to his car
so signor miles drove away and you did what?
senta we have to ask you to stay in rome
yes if it's going to help certainly
so the doctor he has to make the    come se dice?
postmortem?
yes exactly but his first his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening
well he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car
i don't even know what this is this sort of thing ain't my bag baby
can we go up? do you mind?
of course what happened to your face?
even her
what about thomas ripley?
yes sure we did go to san remo that was months ago
november i thought
was it? did you speak to tom?
november 7th is my information
i don't remember the exact date
and when did you last see signor ripley?
hi folks you're entering a restricted zone can i see your security badges?
a few days ago
does he stay with you here?
no
no here is a pattern two days ago freddie miles is dead  he leaves your apartment and is murdered yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november 7th we look at hotel records and we see oh dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat
it's not a pattern it's a coincidence there must be fifty hotels in san remo there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day
31 people
that is miss sherwood now marge sherwood
i think i just said ripley was handling some business for me nor does mr ripley want to marry me nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him and when
do you have a photograph of signor ripley?
i'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends
everything seems to be in order
now i think i have upset you my english perhaps is coarse
it is a little coarse yes
sorry no one has seen signor ripley since san 
i have
you have yes
no i have and so has miss sherwood ask her and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at  the goldoni  tom was staying at the goldoni
good the goldoni yes  you're right a coincidence  i look forward to our next meeting when i will be more careful with my english and persuade you to play me your saxophone alto
absolutely
i have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into mr miles' car she wants to identify you in a  confronto  lineup  tomorrow then?
you got a 44 magnum?
here have a piece of gum
that's an expensive gun
some of these guns are like toys but a smith and wesson man you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on nothing beats quality  you interested in an automatic?
i want a 32 revolver and a palm gun that 22 there
how much for everything
the 32's $150  and you're really getting a good deal now  and all together it comes to ah seven eighty five for four pieces and a holster hell i'll give you the holster we'll make it seventyfive and you've got a deal  a good one
how much to get a permit to carry?
well you're talking big money now i'd say at least five grand maybe more and it would take a while to check it out the way things are going now $5000 is probably low you see i try not to fool with the smalltime crap too risky too little bread say 6 g's but if i get the permit it'll be as solid as the empire state building
nah this'll be fine
you can't carry in a cab even with a permit  so why bother?
is there a firing range around?
what was that korfin?
don't mind if i do
you in nam? can't help but notice your jacket?
huh?
yeah i was all around one hospital then the next
it's hell out there all right a real shiteatin' war i'll say this though: it's bringing a lot of fantastic guns the market's flooded colt automatics are all over 
you like ball games?
huh?
i can get you front and center what do you like? i can get you mets knicks rangers? hell i can get you the mayor's box
is that so?  but what do you think of charles palantine?
who mam?
charles palantine the man you want to volunteer to help elect president
no no i want you to have it even if it's my last piece
oh i think he's a wonderful man make a great great president
you want to canvass?
well that's not exactly what the senator has proposed you might not want to canvass but there is plenty more other work we need done: office work filing poster hanging
i'm a good worker betsy mam a real good worker
if you talk to tom he'll assign you to something
if you don't mind mam i'd rather work for you
well we're all working tonight
well betsy mam i drive a taxi at night
well then what is it you exactly want to do?
why?
no no i want you to have it even if it's my last piece
i don't know
it's just to the corner mam in broad daytime nothing can happen i'll be there to protect you
all right  all right i'm taking a break at four o'clock if you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie
oh i appreciate that betsy mam i'll be here at four o'clock exactly  and ah betsy
yes?
my name is travis
we've signed up 15000 palantine volunteers in new york so far the organizational problems are becoming just staggering
travis i never ever met anybody like you before
i can believe that
where do you live?
noooooooooooooo
oh uptown you know some joint it ain't much
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
i had a regular job for a while days you know doin' this doin' that but i didn't have anything to do at night i got kinda lonely you know just wandering around so i decided to works nights it ain't good to be alone you know
after this job i'm looking forward to being alone for a while
yeah well  in a cab you get to meet people you meet lotsa people it's good for you
what kind of people?
just people people you know just people  had a dead man once
really?
he'd been shot i didn't know that he just crawled into the back seat said "west 45th street" and conked out
what did you do?
commander this is slater in sowest com three we have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle
i shut the meter off for one thing i knew i wasn't going to get paid then i dropped him off at the cop shop they took him
that's really something
oh you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab especially when the moon's out
the moon?
com'on travis it's not that bad i take lots of taxis
i know i could have picked you up
huh?
late one night about three at the plaza
three in the morning? i don't think so i have to go to bed early i work days it must have been somebody else
you're right now i remember it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late the next day i was completely bushed it was unbelievable
is it one of ours?
if it wasn't for a drunk i would have picked you up he wanted to go to the dmz
the dmz?
south bronx the worst i tried to ditch him but he was already in the cab so i had to take him that's the law otherwise i would have picked you up
that would have been quite a coincidence
you'd be surprised how often you see the same people get the same fare people have patterns they do more or less the same things every day i can tell
well i don't go to the plaza every night
i didn't mean you but just ordinary people a guy i know  doughboy  met his wife that way they got to talking she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop taking her home with the flag up
that's very romantic some of your fares must be interesting see any stars politicians deliver any babies yet?
well no not really had some famous people in the cab  i got this guy who makes lasers not regular lasers not the big kind little lasers pocket sized small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio like a gun you know like a ray gun zap
what hours do you work?
no log com bird twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy not stealthy not carbon composite  it does have an odd shape sir
i work a single which means there's no replacement  no second man on the cab six to six sometimes eight seventytwo hours a week
you mean you work seventytwo hours a week
sometimes 76 or 80 sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning eighty miles a day a hundred miles a night
you must be rich
it keeps ya busy
you know what you remind me of?
what?
that song by kris kristofferson where it's said "like a pusher party truth partly fiction a walking contradiction" 
i'm no pusher betsy honest i never have pushed
i didn't mean that travis just the part about the contradiction
what are you saying son?
oh who was that again?
the singer?
yeah yes i don't follow music too much
you didn't have to spend your money  ?
travis you haven't even played the record?
yeah well my stereo player is broke but i'm sure the record is ok
your stereo broke? god i could hardly stand that i live on music
i don't follow music much i'd like to though  honest
so you haven't heard this record yet?
what are you doing?
oh my god he's back
i bought a couple of tickets
but this is a porno movie
damn
what's wrong?
where are you going?
i'm leaving
these are not the kind of movies i go to
well i don't follow movies too much
this is sort of high class
i mean porno movies
in many ways bob's big boy never left sir he's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices
well mostly
my god
there's plenty of movies around here i haven't seen any of them but i'm sure they're good
no travis you're a sweet guy and all that but i think this is it i'm going home
you mean you don't want to go to a movie?  there's plenty of movies around here
no i don't feel so good we're just two very different kinds of people that's all
huh?
it's very simple you go your way i'll go mine thanks anyway travis
but betsy
what about the record?
i don't get you  you act like you're too good for any of this and then you go totally apeshit when you get here
i said yeah you're right chief  as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media
shut up
keep it
hello travis
i see where palantine got the nomination
yes it won't be long now seventeen days
how are you travis? i read about you in the papers
no no please this fare's on me please
travis?
yeah
maybe i'll see you again sometime huh?
tom come here a moment  i think this canvas report is about ready to go out check it out with andy and if he okays if have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county  and don't forget to add the new photo releases
should we scramble tachq for an intercept?
the senator's white paper is almost ready bets should we wait for that?
andy usually just sends those to the national media the local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program push the issues
first push the man then the issue senator palantine is first of all a dynamic man an intelligent interesting fascinating man
you forgot "sexy"
no i didn't forget "sexy"
just didn't get around to it huh?
oh tom please
well for christsakes you sound like you're selling i don't know what cars not issues
have you ever wondered why cbs news has the highest ratings?
commander i have to log it
more people watch it
alright forget it if you're not going to be serious
no c'mon i'm listening i was just
just what?
maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while you'd get somewhere
with who?
well if cronkite's so great why don't we run him instead?
that's the last the finish period some people can learn some people can't and you wonder why we never get serious 
sure we could run him you realize he's already head of his block association
have you been noticing anything strange?
but my design was perfect  your autonomic functions were shut down and even though your arm wasn't frozen the aging was retarded therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left
no why?
why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
what taxi driver?
that taxi driver the one that's been sitting here
how long has he been there?
try holding the match like this
this is gotta be a game right?
this i gotta see
ouch
oh are you all right?
but dr evil all you need to do is  work with this tennis ball squeeze it for twenty minutes a day a few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm
i'm great always set my fingers on fire if you want to see another trick i do this thing with my nose
no i just wanted to see if you could light it that way the guy at the newsstand can
ah yes the guy at the newsstand mr asbestos
he happens to be missing fingers i first noticed when 
is he italian?
no why?
you sure he's not italian?
he's black ok?
well if he had been italian they could have been shot off sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson if they blow a job or something
as i said he isn't italian besides i thought they just killed them
we could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;
don't be naive they can't kill everybody they have different punishments for different things like if they kill a stool pigeon they leave a canary on the body it's symbolic
why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
i don't know maybe they don't leave a canary don't be technical what i'm saying is if this newsstand guy's italian and his fingers are gone maybe he's a thief
first he's not italian second he's not a thief i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change  the right change two of his fingers are missing just stubs like they were blown away i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette i couldn't help watching i was dying to see how he'd light it
with the other hand right?
no stupid with the stubs that's the whole point
i know that guy his hand looks like a paw an old black guy the newsstand at 
no this is young  well i'm never sure how old black people are  but anyway he isn't old that's for sure
betsy come over here a moment

st michael's church fort walton kansas  front pew  right leg = hollow
hi
i'm sure a lot of people down in la are worried sick about you
this luke was a pretty good guy wasn't he?
we've heard from scott now let's hear from you
oh yes  yes he was
well let me tell you i'm not luke  i know who i am now and you don't  and i don't like me very much
you know it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete  pete  pete  it's a nice name
i believe you
the truth is i'm a lot of things but communist isn't one of them
but if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care? besides why should it even matter if you were a communist?
come on delly look at the country today  we're fighting communists in korea we're paranoid about the russians we've got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb  you think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the american public with party propaganda like gosh i don't know "sand pirates of the sahara?"
what about you delly?
you'll stand by me?
you've got everything?
the details of my life are quite inconsequential
yeah  except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact
you'll be fine  no matter what leo kubelsky says you've got a hundred and seventyfive years of american law on your side  don't forget that
i wish you were coming with me
and who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  mrs terwilliger?
did you bring along something to read?
not exactly light reading i know believe it or not i've read this since high school and it got me all the way through law school besides there's something in there that'll help you  you won't have to get very far it's near the beginning
delly thanks thank you  i'll take good care of this
just remember two things  first the law is a living thing  it made us free and it keeps us free sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes sometimes it makes mistakes sometimes big mistakes  but in the end the law prevails for the just sometimes it takes a while
tell them pete  tell them
i see you got the telegram
hi
pete i'm so sorry about what they did to you  i didn't think you'd come back i thought you'd want to write again
dell i can't write unless i'm happy and i can't be happy unless i'm here  and with you  this is me delly  pete appleton and i love you
dad?
how'd it go?
not as bad as i thought it would i think i passed
that's my girl  did you?
i think  it's worse  now
that always used to work
yeah well it's not everyday you get  news like this  you're sure he's  okay?  other than the  bump on the head?
well
hello scott i'm your father dr evil  i have a son i have a son everyone i have a son  someday scott this will all be yours
he doesn't remember anything delly  doesn't know how he got here doesn't remember his father the town the bijou anyone
 including me  right?  
i'm afraid not  he looked right at your picture without batting an eye  but it's probably temporary he got all the way to lawson so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head i'm sure it'll all come back to him  it just takes a catalyst
you mean  me?
daddy that's luke can you let him in?  i'll be right down
besides daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working
do you remember me?
what
no i i just wondering where you've been all this time
me too
but scott who's going to take over the world when i die?
you look different
i do?
yeah a little  i think you grew an inch or so  and you've lost weight
you can all go home now  he's not going anywhere
then why do i feel like we're still being shadowed?
city hall?
you first
why me?
of course there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here
how'd they get it inside?
coffee for me i gotta slow down
an evil vet?
right here  "albert lucas trumbo" and all the others  i knew them all  so did you  we went to school with most of them
it doesn't seem right this being down here  it ought to be where people can see it
so you're really gonna be a lawyer?
and why not?
whoa
sorry  you don't know how many times i've heard that  "a lady lawyer?  are you crazy?"  like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man  or better in fact
have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
you don't remember but yes ever since i was a little girl
what did what did i want to be?
you don't have a boyfriend or anyone you know like that?
no maybe like work in a petting zoo or something
actually i was married  for four years  but well we didn't fit together  i'm divorced now
i'm sorry
no it's okay  see when two people belong together the other person should be the the key that unlocks the rest of you i'm not making sense am i?
no you are  i know exactly what you mean  it's not that you're missing something  it's that the other person gives something to you that you had all the time you just didn't see it until they came along
we were in love weren't we?
what was that?
nothing  
do you have the
were we going to get married?
no you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before
an evil petting zoo?
oh
this is strange  do you feel it?
what?
we've done this before so many times  the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday
you know everyone's so excited about the bijou reopening
it's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place delly
nine hundred
yeah and needless to say none of us has that kind of money lying around
what about a loan?  you could go to the bank?
a loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nineandahalf years of his life? not likely
scott my boy come here how was your day?
well there's got to be a way
when did you start smoking?
i don't smoke?
you tried to once  it was pretty pitiful
they're not bad
no they're not  i'd say your investment was paying dividends
my what?
back in '37 you heard benny goodman play for the first time so you went out and got a used clarinet  you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him you tried hard but it wasn't long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder  so you gave the clarinet to spencer
huh  that was nice of me
you had a hidden agenda though see when he was five or six little spence used to follow you around like a puppy  bothered the hell out of you  but as soon as you gave him the clarinet
well me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and like they don't speak english right and so my buddy gets into a fight and he goes 'hey quit hassling me cause i don't speak french or whatever' and the other guy goes something in paris talk and i go 'um just back off' and he goes 'get out' and i go 'make me'
 he started practicing and he left me alone from then on
exactly  and he got good
now did you remember that or
nope  just filling in the blanks
how do you tell those two apart anyway?
alex and charlie?  simple  alex is the smarter one
your dancing's very good
thanks
it never used to be  you were two left feet on the dance floor  like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step
what do you remember?
fascinating what are your plans for this evening?
well everything  it started coming back a couple of days ago i remember everything now
i see
delly shhhhhh
sir that is true
mr appleton do you know an "albert lucas trumbo?"
luke trumbo?  we never met  but i'd like to think i know him
is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson?
mr clyde you're twisting things around  i wasn't masquerading luke trumbo luke was a good man who gave his life for his country i just happen to look a little bit like him  that's all
yes i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead  i also see that you were posted stateside during the war  fort dix?
yes sir
thought i'd stay in there's a good tittie movie on skinemax
now i see that you've been running a movie theater in lawson called "the bijou" is that also true?
anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your "accident" mr appleton  an accident which conveniently came hard upon your dismissal from united pictures  tell us this "accident" of yours are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
yes
sir are you referring to the fact that i was suffering from amnesia and i've since recovered my memory?
i'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident"
mr clyde i remember everything
yes yes i do
referring to line thirtyseven of the document does your printed name and signature appear there?
yes it does
mr appleton please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "bread instead of bullets club?"
and that's how you want to live your life is it?
mr clyde do you want to know what i knew then or do you want to know what i know now?  they're two different things?
start with what you knew then
well i'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirtysix of the document and the name printed and signed there
we see it  for the record it reads "lucille angstrom"  what's the point of this?
well that's what i knew then  or who i knew i should say  you see i was trying to court miss angstrom  i went to the meeting to impress her
are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
all right mr appleton  that was what you knew then  what do you know now?
well i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college  i know that i've been branded a communist which i'm not but even if i was it shouldn't matter or what do we have a bill of rights for?
are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party?
no sir
scott i want you to meet daddy's nemesis austin powers
are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
i'm not refuting anything
yet you're contradicting yourself you earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist partyrun organization yet you just said under oath that you were not now  nor ever  a member of the communist party
that's not a contradiction at all sir  i went to the meeting but i didn't go as a member
do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the united states house of representatives will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god?
i do
be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record
peter kenneth appleton  hollywood california
the chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today mr appleton  we certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
i'll do my best mr chairman
why are you feeding him? why don't you just kill him?
now we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read is that correct?
yes  a prepared statement
i'm a little hesitant to say
mr appleton you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the united states congress believe you me you do not want to incur our wrath
mr appleton?  mr appleton?
i i need a drink of water
mr chairman there's another amendment that i'd like to invoke at this time but it's not the fifth amendment  i wonder if you're familiar with it
cecil  cecil there's a young man in there
lord love a duck harry you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
only one in town  get in son
vodka tonic
in due time
here we are
thanks for the lift cecil
no wallet huh?
no identification at all  what're you thinkin' cecil?
doc with your permission i want to bring someone in here  maybe it'll jar this young man's memory
are you saying that he's
mother o'god
tomorrow afternoon   oh my god
yes
you ever been in this town before to your knowledge?
but what if he escapes? why don't you just shoot him? what are you waiting for?
no  but
but what?
well this place sorta reminds me of something
what's that?
"it's a wonderful life"
the jimmy stewart picture?  i remember that one  saw it over at the bijou  so you remember that huh?
"it's a wonderful life?"
or the bijou  either one
c'mon i'll give you two a lift back to the bijou
well no but these gentlemen would like to get some answers
i have a better idea i'm going to put him in an easilyescapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death
luke you probably don't remember me roscoe fitts i'm the grocer here in town
good to meet you  again
like ernie said we're all glad to have you back
thanks
and i hear you and harry are planning on reopening the bijou
we're gonna try  place needs a lot of work
i can only imagine  you know i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands  i don't think he gave it very much thought
well he loves the place  it's his home
luke i'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation i'll come to the point  i want to buy the property and i'm prepared to offer sixthousand dollars for it  and that's just for the property mind you  if you want i'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has and you keep those proceeds  i just want the land
that's well that's very generous but if you've already got a store?
why don't you just shoot him now? here i'll get a gun we'll just shoot him bang dead done
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered  i plan on putting up a freestanding supermarket
a super market  huh
so you do intend to fix the place up after all?
excuse me what's your um your name?
harry son  harry
and what's my name again?
albert lucas trumbo  but you've been "luke" since you were a baby
you never came back from the war we were told you were missing and presumed dead
when did i leave?
nine andahalf years ago
fine whatever mutated illtempered sea bass it is  come let's return to dinner close the tank
wait'll you see the inside
we've been closed for a while
exactly how long has the bijou been closed?
hmmmm after you left it was difficult and then lily  that's your mother  she took ill and died we haven't shown a picture since fortyeight
why?
well after the war with so many of the town's boys killed people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies i guess  some of 'em moved away  los angeles sacramento san francisco  wasn't much to keep 'em here i expect and now with this "television" thing  people just aren't going out as much as they used to
didn't you have any help?
that's lily  your mother rest her soul
mother  she's beautiful
they couldn't wait to see you
aren't you going to watch them? they'll get away
who are they?
this is the staff of the bijou
oh  what what time is it?
i promised him a new uniform when we reopened  and you'll get one too
um harry?  did i ever keep the books here?
no your mother did then i did after she passed
"february 10 1942  picture 'ball of fire'"
gary cooper  and barbara stanwyck yowsa
yes?
"one fryer and twodozen eggs?"
no we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and we'll just assume it all went to plan
fortytwo was a lean year around here  the war had just started you were gone less than a month and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall  not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me  at that time it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures
yeah i know but poultry?
but i
ernie
carl  friend of yours from high school  everybody calls him "cueball"
i'll be home in a little while harry  don't wait up
you two have a lot of catching up to do i guess
you bet
well
yes?
i have a gun in my room give me five seconds i'll come back and blow their brains out
and you have sixtyeight dollars and thirtyseven cents in the bank your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month to which you're no longer entitled since i'm alive and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make  what are those?
why don't you two get out there and dance?
beautiful wasn't it?
yes
well son i wish i could've shown you more but this is all that's left  just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago nineteen twentyfive to be exact
dad i
ha
 what?
luke what time is it?
jesus
come everyone let us repair to the main chamber project vulcan is about to begin scott are you coming?
the film broke
i'm here
did you did you
did i what?
did you fix the damn film?  it broke in the last reel
i know  everyone went home  we offered them refunds
anybody take it?
a few
i'm not happy about this mind you but if i have to go at least i'm going in my own bed the same bed my lily died in and knowing that my son is alive  that's not too shabby is it?
you're not going anywhere harry
i don't want to
pete  you think maybe you've had enough?
thanks jerry  tell me something
what
you tight with j edgar hoover?
the gman?
zackly
pete if j edgar hoover walked in here wearing a dress i wouldn't know him
too bad  he says i'm a communist
you should watch what you say  you don't know who's listening
you know i'm not a communist don't you jer?
it was freaky i'll tell you  stupid kid
don't you want to see what daddy does for a living?
sure i suppose  that why you're on a bender?
pete go home  come on i'll call that girlfriend of yours what's her name sandy?
sandra sinclair
gimmee her number i'll have her pick you up
sandra sinclair  wanna know her real name?  bella iskowitz  no one's who they really are jer everyone's someone else  even you even me  especially me  i'm peter appleton the communist who's not really a communist
nope  can't  we're through
then i'll call you a cab
'sides car's right outside  i'll be seein' ya jer
any idea how you got here son?
been drinkin' a bit have we?

i don't remember  i guess so smells like it  tastes like it
well you've been wet to the skin you must've fallen in
i guess i did
here one of mine
do you remember if you were driving a car?  maybe you went over the bridge  no guard rail there it's easy to do  it's happened before
it's possible  i just don't remember
and you don't know your name or who you are that right?
i no i i just can't
what is it?
call me ishmael?
what did you say?
that's me and my daughter adele my pride and joy  charms the fish right out of the lake she does
she's very pretty
 sorry 'bout that but you do look familiar to me
that's where you live
evening luke
what's wrong?
uh no just seeing you standing there it reminded me there's a word for it
you kids off to the dance?
aren't you coming?
it's a pretty massive heart attack his lungs have filled with fluid and well it seems as though his body is just shutting down
dad we just made a breakthrough in group
can we get him to the hospital?
you smell gas?
don't smell nothin'  he must not be dead in here
jesus
you think he's drunk somewhere?
wouldn't blame him if he was
well his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency  he lose his job or somethin'?
what's his rent?
here's three months rent and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place  now i need a moment alone
huh?
i had the group liquidated you little shit they were insolent
take a hike  amscray
peter their hands are tied  you see that don't you?
i i don't believe this
are you saying it's a mistake that you didn't go to any meetings? they say you did
who the hell is this "they?"
congress the fbi red channels it don't matter who the hell "they" is  "they" know who "they" are that's all that matters  now did you go to any meetings?
no  yeah i i don't know maybe i did  leo this was before pearl harbor  i was in college it was a bunch of kids and i was just one of 'em  i didn't believe in what they were saying  hell i didn't even know what they were saying
so you're saying that it's true you went to a meeting of a known communist organization
leo i was trying to impress a skirt  you know me i'm non political  republican democrat communist there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway
you should watch what you say
i hate you i hate you i wish i was never artificially created in a lab
i don't know who fingered me but i'm not a communist
kid that cuts no ice with them
what?  that i'm accused of being a communist when i don't happen to be one?
they know you were at that meeting peter  they've been told and they know
leo you're my agent  tell "them" to take a flyin' piss  i didn't do anything wrong  i fought in the war for crissakes
fought?  come on pete you ran the px at fort dix
i was decorated
i know  a purple heart
exactly
you broke your arm  you were coming out of a bar  you were drunk
we also own the franklin mint which makes decorative handpainted theme plates for collectors  some plates like the gone with the wind series have gone up in value as much as twohundred and forty percent but as with any investment there is some risk involved
at least i was on our side  look they want me to testify?  i'll testify  i'll tell 'em anything they want to hear  jesus leo this is my career
you can't testify
they don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them  they just don't want you writing pictures for now that's all
yeah well that's enough
peter i believe in you  more to the point i read your new script um
"ashes to ashes?"
that's the one "ashes to ashes" i think it's great  but it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head you can't work until you're cleared  and believe me starting right now i'm gonna do everything i can to make that happen
so it is a blacklist
don't say that  there is no such thing as a blacklist  now are you gonna play ball?
the fbi can't arrest you because you haven't done anything wrong
um dr evil prince charles did have an affair he admitted it and they are now divorced actually
well that's a relief  i understand they usually don't let that stop them
however you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the unamerican activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles  now if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear they'll clear you
and i won't be a communist anymore
exactly
next time it might be the fbi the time after that it might be the president  but it'll always be someone  count on it
that's not the country luke fought for
lest we forget peter your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than luke's
it's wrong leo
that was quite a show you gave them today  we shoulda sold tickets
i'm not sorry for what i said
umm that also has already happened
cigarette?
when'd you quit smoking?
luke didn't smoke
oh i see  but you're not luke you're peter appleton the picture writer
not any more
why not?
leo you were in there you saw what i did  you think they're gonna let me write pictures?  hell they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail
not at all
besides i don't even know if i want to write anymore
peter i'm an agent  i buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you  that's what i do  you're a writer  you write pictures that's what you do  and trust me you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning
don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? a million dollars isn't that much money these days
what do you mean?
kid you gave them what they wanted  this committee it feeds on names  the more names the better  but for some highprofile witnesses like yourself any name will do
leo i didn't give them the names i wouldn't do that
her name was right there in front of them  they gave it to me i didn't give it to them
well that's not what they think
leo she was she was a girl i knew in college
you should keep track of your old school chums  turns out she eventually joined the communist party  on top of which she's lucy angstrom hirschfeld now and she happens to be a writer for "studio one" on cbs
oh god oh god no i
so our lawyers had a talk with the committee's lawyers  that elvin clyde fella won't be too happy about it but we cut a deal they cleared you  and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself
thank me publicly?  for what?  for ruining this woman's life?
i'm gonna propose
virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year
i haven't danced with another man since mr terwilliger passed
when was that?
that was beautiful
i taught you that
i can play the piano?

no  absolutely not
miss hayworth?
yes?
yes?
the man at the post office sent me he said you'd know the name of the little brenner girl

did you drive up from san francisco?
why?
yes
it's a nice drive  is that where you met mitch?

well i'd really hope to rent it for

i would appreciate it i've tried everywhere in town and they're all full
it's utilitarian i'll say that for it
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store you see i hadn't planned on spending much time here
miss daniels? is that you?
hi  is something wrong? is that cut beginning to bother you?
no it's not the cut that's bothering me
would you like some brandy?
if you have some i'd
no thank you  won't you call me melanie?
thank you
you can't judge him by modern standards he's very much a product of his times in my day he could have any woman he wanted
or would you rather i changed the subject?
i think so
how do you like our little hamlet?
i despise it
well i don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside it takes a while to get used to
where are you from originally annie?
san francisco
how'd you happen to come here?
i guess you knew that anyway
i suspected as much
when?
what about his teeth?
you needn't worry it's over and done with a long time ago
annie  there's nothing between mitch and me
isn't there?  maybe there isn't maybe there's never anything between mitch and any girl
what do you mean?
i think i'll have some of that too  i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco you know  and then one weekend he asked me up to meet lydia
when was this?
four years ago of course that was shortly after his father died  things may be different now
different?
with lydia  did she seem a trifle distant?
a trifle
you have to understand in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth it didn't matter
then maybe it isn't different at all you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy i simply couldn't understand it
when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i'd done to displease her
and what had you done?
nothing i simply existed so what was the answer? a jealous woman right? a clinging possessive mother  wrong with all due respect to oedipus i don't think that was the case at all
then what was it?
lydia liked me you see that was the strange part of it in fact now that i'm no longer a threat we're very good friends
then why did she object to you?
because she was afraid
afraid you'd take mitch?
afraid i'd give mitch
i just don't see it
i don't understand
afraid of any woman who'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him  love
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman
no i don't think so she's not afraid of losing her son you see  she's only afraid of being abandoned
someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter
she already has a daughter
what about mitch? didn't he have anything to say about this?
i can understand his position he went through a lot with lydia after his father died he didn't want to risk going through it all over again
i see
so it ended not immediately of course i went back to san francisco and i still saw mitch every now and then but we both knew it was finished
just wait once austin gets you in his charms it's impossible to get out
then what are you doing here in bodega bay?
you get straight to the point don't you?
i'm sorry forgive me
no that's all right i don't mind i came up here for two reasons to begin with i was bored with my job in san francisco i was teaching at a private school there well you know you probably went to one yourself
i did
then you know little girls in brown beanies deadly here i have a life i'll go into that classroom on monday morning and i'll look out at twenty five upturned little faces and each of them will be saying 'yes please give me what you have'  and i'll give them what i have i haven't got very much but i'll give them every ounce of it to me that's very important it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time  that's the first reason
and the second?
he wants me to go to cathy's party tomorrow afternoon  i said i would
i'll be going too to help out it should be fun melanie
do you think i should go?
did you ever
that's up to you
it's really up to lydia isn't it?
never mind lydia do you want to go?
yes
is anyone there?
look
he got a call from dan fawcett a little while ago his chickens won't eat either
it's what you said mom mr brinkmeyer's feed is no good
mitch knows lots of people in san francisco of course they're mostly hoods
cathy
of course not i was married to your father
well mom he's the first to admit it  he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice
in a democracy cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial your brother's practice
yes i did
mother
mitch can i bring the lovebirds in here?
no
mom they're in a cage
they haven't harmed anyone
miss daniels?
they're beautiful they're just what i wanted is there a man and a woman? i can't tell which is which
did you ever want to?
i still don't understand how you knew i wanted lovebirds
is smoking fun?
oh i suppose so
could i have a puff?
i don't think your mother would like that
why it's just like air isn't it?  when i grow up i'm gonna smoke like a chimney i'll be eleven tomorrow you know
i know
are you coming to my party?
i don't think so  i have to get back to san francisco
don't you like us?
you didn't answer my question mum
darling of course i do
don't you like bodega bay?
i don't know yet
mitch likes it very much he comes up every weekend you know even though he has his own apartment in the city he says san francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge
i guess it does get a little hectic at times
why didn't annie stay for dinner?
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east
oh where d'you want the coffee?
take it into the living room would you hon?
we've got an extra room upstairs and everything
no it's been too long best to leave things alone
yeah but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to san francisco
mitch? why are they doing this?  the birds
i don't know honey
why are they trying to kill people?
cathy get a blanket and some bandages
mitch let's turn back
mitch?  do do you think they'll be all right? in the trunk? can they breath?
what?
the little brenner girl
lois
i'm on with a friend  look i'd better go i love you
it's alice ain't it?

the brenners? mr and mrs brenner?
well it's kind of weird
nope just lydia and the two kids
the two kids?
yep mitch and the little girl
i see how do i get down there?
follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left that'll take you right around the bay to their front door
the front door  isn't there a back road i can take?
nope that's the road straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door
you see i wanted to surprise them
mmmm
i didn't want to come right down the road where they could see me
we don't judge here
mmmm
it's a surprise you see
mmmmmm  'course you could get yourself a boat cut right across the bay with it the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at if that's what you wanted to do
where would i get a boat?
down at the dock by the tides restaurant ever handled an outboard boat?
of course
d'you want me to order one for you?
thank you
what name?
daniels
ok well i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago he was partially frozen for thirty years i never knew him growing up he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
i wonder if you could tell me
yep?
the little girl's name
the little brenner girl?
yes
are you sure?
well i ain't positive if that's what you mean
i need her exact name you see
that case i tell you what you do you go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there not the motel that's the other end of town this is the hotel now you take a right turn there you got that?
yes?
and how do you feel about that?
near the top of the hill you'll see the school and right behind it the church you head for the school now just past the school you'll see a little house with a red mail box that's where annie hayworth lives she's the school teacher you ask her about the little brenner girl
thank you
yep  could save yourself a lot of trouble her name's alice for sure
how much for the phone calls?
i don't see what difference it makes mrs bundy crows or blackbirds if they attacked the school that's pretty serious
mrs bundy you don't seem to understand this young lady says there was an attack on the school
i didn't even know there were many crows in bodega bay this time of year
why not mrs bundy?
what good'll that do? smoke's as bad as birds
deke have you got a first aid kit back there?
what do you want to do scott?
what happened?
young woman cut herself
shall i call the doctor?
you cut yourself outside miss?
i had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once sued me before i could bat an eyelash
i don't think miss daniels is going to sue anybody
we don't have any fog this time of year mitch
gulls
are you finished here sebastian?
let me have some apple pie helen  who said anything about war? all i said was that some gulls
we don't label people here scott
one apple pie you want more coffee?
here's your pie sebastian you want it at the table?
no here's fine 
i thought i saw your car what are you doing in town?
i had to acknowledge a delivery  mother i'd like you to meet
a what?
how do you do miss daniels?  acknowledge a what?
oh i see
for cathy for her birthday by the way where is she?
across at brinkmeyer's
no he's really evil
you did say birds?
yes lovebirds we couldn't let you
lovebirds i see
seven o'clock same as usual
there's nothing wrong with those chickens mitch i'm going to call fred brinkmeyer right now
he sold the feed to me didn't he?
caviat emptor mother let the buyer beware
whose side are you on?
i'm simply quoting the law
she's a charming girl isn't she mitch?
i just think like he hates me i really think he wants to kill me
yes very
and certainly pretty
yes
how long have you known her?
i told you we met yesterday
in a bird shop
yes
she was selling birds
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother it's really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
we're not yet open for business i'm afraid
mother where did you go to law school?
forgive me i suppose i'm just naturally curious about a girl like that  she's very rich isn't she?
i suppose so her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco
you'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print she's always mentioned in the columns mitch
i know mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer isn't she?
yes mother
perhaps i'm oldfashioned  i know it was supposed to be very warm there mitch but well actually well the newspaper said she was naked
i know mother
it's none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to
listen i know you hate having to sit home because i'm not susie high school
what's he looking for?
shame i was recommended by a friend
mother?
yes?
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself
well  so long as you know what you want mitch
well well is everyone all right?
tell him about the party
did you you get the windows in the attic mitch?
i got them all mother
when do you think they'll come?
i don't know
really?
if there are larger birds mitch they'll get into the house
that's a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
not now  not while they're massing out there
when?
i don't know when  we'll see what
where will we go?
i don't know yet  i think we'll be safe here  let's bring that wood in
i don't know we'll break up the furni
mother i'm trying my best  i'm trying my
sir august merryweather? i was looking for something relaxing say a tuscan hillside in june?
mitch
mother get a rope
oh my god look at her
i can handle it
i'm not very good at this mitch
you're doing fine
they're gone the same pattern
but they'll be back
we won't be here
where can we go mitch? there's no place to go
normally we'd be eager to oblige 
i want to try for san francisco there are buildings there steel and concrete
we'd never make it they're probably all over the road
we have to try it  we can't stay here  melanie needs help  mother the house won't take another attack
if  if when we get to san francisco  if they're already there?
they won't be
if they are?
we'll worry about that when we get there
i'm frightened terribly frightened i i don't know what's out there mitch
what do we have to know mother? we're all together we all love each other we all need each other what else is there? mother i want us to stay alive
i started to say inside
seriously?
then you knew mitch in san francisco is that right?
if i go across to santa rosa i'll come onto the freeway much earlier
no it's me mrs brenner i thought you might like some tea
where's mitch?
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
why? didn't al believe my story?
he was calling from the farm mrs brenner
then he saw
he must have he sent for the santa rosa police
do you think cathy's all right?
of course natural weather delivered to your door on demand down your phoneline for limited periods
what?
yes i'm sure she's fine
do i sound foolish to you?
no
i keep seeing dan fawcett's face  they have such big windows at the school  all the windows were broken in dan's bedroom all the windows
try not to think of that mrs brenner
i wish i were a stronger person there is a long awkward silence she sips at her tea reflectively
i lost my husband four years ago you know  it's odd how you depend on someone for strength and then suddenly all the strength is gone and you're alone  i'd love to relax some time i'd love to be able to sleep  do you think cathy's all right?
annie's there she'll be all right
i'm not this way you know not usually i don't fuss and fret over my children  when frank died  you see he knew the children he really knew them he had the knack of being able to enter into their world of becoming a part of them that's a rare talent
you don't say how real does it feel?
yes
i miss him  you know sometimes i wake up in the morning and i think 'i have to make frank's breakfast' and i i get up and there's a a very good reason for getting out of bed until until of course i remember  i miss talking to him  cathy's a child you know and mitch  mitch has his own life  i'm glad he stayed here today i feel safer with him here 
would you like to rest now mrs brenner
no  no don't go yet  i feel as if i i don't understand you and i want so much to understand
why mrs brenner?
because my son is  my son seems to be fond of you  and i  i'm not quite sure how i feel about it i really don't know if i like you or not
is that so important mrs brenner? you liking me?
yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you don't?
then i don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me
as real as you wish hot or cold humid or dry anything you like within reason
i think it might also matter to mitch
mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do  i'm not complaining that's the mark of a man  but  you see i i wouldn't want to be be left alone i don't think i could bear being left alone  i forgive me this business with the birds has me upset  i i don't know what i'd do if mitch weren't here
why don't you try to sleep now mrs brenner
i wish i were stronger  do you think she's all right? do you think she's safe at the school?
would you like me to go for her?
i couldn't ask you to
i don't mind really
would you? i'd feel so much better
that's the last of it
did you close the door?
there are limits?
please don't mess me up with bandages mrs brenner
shhhh shhhh
that's a chimney swift all right
well these birds live in chimneys you know
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar  did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know  sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al?
i don't think i get you mitch do about what?
the technology is brand new soon it will be more powerful we anticipate a huge demand leave us your number we'll be in touch
what's more likely they got in the room and was just panicked that's all
all right i'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room but they didn't just get in they came in right down that chimney
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
didn't know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there 
these birds were
oh yeah yeah  how old is she now?
does this room look silly?
well if there's anything else i can do mitch
thanks al we'll be all right
he was killed last night by birds
where is she?
i want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when i say these words do you understand  ?  blue 
there's an ordinance against burning anything in this town unless it's
is that for mitch brenner?
yes
he's not home
he won't be back until monday i mean if those birds are for him
monday?
yes i don't think you should leave them in the hall do you?
well where did he go?
bodega bay he goes up there every weekend
bodega bay? where's that?
 bottle 
up on the coast about sixty miles north of here
sixty  oh
about an hour and a half on the freeway or two if you take the coast highway
oh
i'd hold the birds for him but i'm going away myself someone's got to feed them i suppose
yes yes someone's got to feed them
i wonder if you could help me
what?
yes what was it you were looking for sir?
lovebirds
red 
lovebirds sir?
yes i understand there are different varieties it that true?
well yes sir there are
these are for my sister her birthday you see as she'll be eleven and well frankly i wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative
i understand completely sir
as the same time i wouldn't want birds that were aloof either
no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly?
i think so sir  now then let me see
aren't these lovebirds?
knight 
no sir those are redbirds
the sign says strawberry finches
yes we call them that too  ahhh here we are lovebirds 
those are canaries miss  doesn't this make you feel awful?
doesn't what make me?
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
well we can't just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
oh certainly it's to protect the species
i imagine that's very important especially during the moulting season
black
yes that's a particularly dangerous time
are they moulting now?
some of them are
how can you tell?
yes i see  about those lovebirds miss
are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? we have some very nice canaries this week
what did you say?
i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
but how how do you know my name?
a little birdie told me  good day miss daniels  madam 
 death 
i don't know you
ahhh but i know you
how?
we met in court
we never met in court or anyplace else
that's true i'll rephrase it i saw you in court
when?
do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
i didn't break that window
no but your little prank did the judge should have put you behind bars
love
what are you? a policeman?
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and i'm not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
you knew i didn't work here you deliberately
right i recognized you when i came in i thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag what do you think of that miss daniels?
i think you're a louse
i am  good day  madam 
and i'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds
that was the damndest thing i ever saw
flower 
what made it
what's that?
so you're a lawyer
that's right what are you doing in bodega bay?
do you practice here?
no san francisco what are you?
what kind of law?
criminal
is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
not everyone miss daniels
nature 
ouch
i'm sorry  what are you doing up here?
didn't you see the lovebirds?
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway
what for?
to see a friend of mine  will you please be careful?
i'm sorry  who's your friend?
why 
yes?
 preserve
annie annie hayworth
well well small world annie hayworth
yes
how do you know annie?
we we went to school together college
did you imagine that how long will you be staying?
just a few just a day or two the weekend
i think we'll have to shave the hair deke have you got a razor?
oh no you don't
so you came up to see annie huh?
takin' a bath
secret 
yes
i don't believe you  i think you came up to see me
why would i want to see you of all people?
i don't know but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was and where i lived and
it was no trouble at all i simply called my father's paper besides i was coming up here anyway i already told you
you like me huh?
i loathe you you have no manners and you're arrogant and conceited and i wrote you a letter about it in fact but i tore it up
what did it say?
can't see a thing
i can't say i like your seagulls much either i come all the way up here to
 love
but you were coming up anyway remember?
i was and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head
right next to the one you already had
after all you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds
yes but
you are aren't you?
certainly but
with with annie of course
of course how stupid of me a quarter to seven will that be all right?
annie annie may have made other plans i'll have to see besides i can find my own way
hope
you're sure now? you won't hire a boat or anything?
i'm sure
seven o'clock then
hi annie had no plans huh? i'm glad you came are you hungry?
famished
why did he shoot her?
he was watching a ball game on television
what?
you'll be able to find your way back won't you?
oh yes
 love 
will i be seeing you again?
san francisco's a long way from here
i'm in san francisco five days a week with a lot of time on my hands i'd like to see you  maybe we could go swimming or something mother tells me you like to swim
how does mother know what i like to do?
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
oh that rome
mmmm i like to swim we might get along very
in case you're interested i was pushed into that fountain
without any clothes on?
with all my clothes on  the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper  anything they said
fear 
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh?
i'm neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
yes but
who didn't much care for propriety or convention or
yes
the opinions of others and you went right along with them isn't that the truth?
yes that's the truth but i was pushed into that fountain and that's the truth too
sure do you really know annie hayworth?
no  at least i didn't until i came up here
 love 
so you didn't go to school together
no
and you didn't come up here to see her
no
you were lying
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie too?
i wrote the letter
what did it say?
it said "dear mr brenner i think you need those lovebirds after all they may help your personality" that's what it said
how long have i been here?
but you tore it up
yes
why?
because it seemed stupid and foolish
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe?
i'd still like to see you
why?
that might have been good enough in rome last summer but it's not good enough now
he said if it vanished he'd know it was  you who betrayed him he took a huge risk the ultimate test
it is for me
but not for me
what do you want ?
i really shouldn't have any more i'm a little tipsy already
i'm trying to get you to stay for dinner we're going to have a lot of roast left over
i couldn't possibly i have to get back
cheers
what's in this? nitroglycerin?
why do you have to rush off? what's so important in san francisco?
well i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
would that i could say the same
you have a job?
i have several jobs
what do you do?
i do different things on different days
like what?
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers' aid at the airport
helping travelers
and on tuesdays i take a course in general semantics at berkeley  that's not a job of course i just take it because
what about thursdays and fridays?
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch  i'm chairman of a group that's sending a little korean boy through school we plan how to raise funds and things like that 
i've come to apply for membership in brolly 
and fridays? what do you do then?
nothing  i go to bird shops on fridays
i'm glad you do
do you know what i was doing in that shop?
what?
i have an aunt you see aunt tessa she's seventy years old and veddy prim and straitlaced  she's coming back from europe at the end of the month and i'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her
what'll it say?
you'll think me very bold sir
are you all right?
you look a little shaken
any id?
i so agree how did you acquire a taste for it?
i i am  mitch is mitch this isn't usual is it? the gull yesterday when i was in the boat and the one last night at annie's and now
last night? what do you mean?
a gull smashed into annie's front door  mitch what's happening?
i don't know melanie  look do you have to go back to annie's?
no i have my things in the car
do you want some mustard with this?
some cream?
i'll take cathy up to bed
are you staying?
it smelled of the fire
you
it's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday isn't it? it's so beautiful and still now  i think i've got it all figured out by the way
really? tell me about it
it's an uprising
of birds?
it all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills a malcontent he went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet preaching wherever anyone would listen
growing a beard
yes of course he had to have a beard 'birds of the world unite' he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well they'll go along with anything
have we met?
sure but eventually even the more seriousminded birds began to listen "why should humans rule?" they asked themselves
hear
why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
hear hear
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
take wing
what it was probably
mmm?
they're probably hungry that's all this was a bad summer they eat berries and and nuts you know and the hills are all burned out so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it
it's so damn quiet out there
ah beautiful just as he promised
it was like that yesterday
what do you mean?
after the gulls attacked
i hadn't thought of that  and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if they're they're waiting or resting or
melanie melanie
i'm frightened mitch
no no
i'm frightened and confused and i i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and and concrete and
melanie
promised? who promised?
that was al on the phone he wants me to meet him out at the fawcett place says some detectives from santa rosa'll be there in a little while  will you be all right here?
i got here as fast as i could where's cathy?
i think it's safe to get out now
don't let's take any chances
the town looks clear
the bay doesn't
how long have they been gathering there?
i keep thinking of annie 
it it doesn't look very different does it? a little smoke over the town but otherwise
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
mrs peel  come quickly brolly's been betrayed i'll tell you everything  the weather's getting worse and worse  they're after me  coming for me  come quickly

inland
santa rosa?

i thought they'd have stopped by now
what time is it?
almost two am
may i help you madam 
you must be exhausted
you'd have been safe in san francisco
the power
mitch
we'd better light some of those lamps
mitch if they hear the car starting if they see movement
can we turn back?
hello mrs macgruder have you ever seen so many gulls?
hello miss daniels
i was hoping you'd be a little late miss daniels  you see he hasn't arrived yet
mr john steed please
you said three o'clock
i know oh i know  i've been calling all morning oh you have no idea miss daniels they're so difficult to get really they are we get them from india you know when they're just little chicks and then we have to
well this one won't be a chick will he?
certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown
and he'll talk?
well yes he'll talk well no no you'll have to teach him to talk
yes
yes  oh my i suppose i should call them again they said three o'clock  maybe it's the traffic i'll call would you mind waiting?
i think maybe you'd better deliver him let me give you my address 
i'm sure they're on the way though could i just call?
i'm afraid that's impossible
there we are
that that who was that?
have you got a pencil?
they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon if you'd care to come back
no you'd better send him may i use your phone?
yes certainly 
do you have any lovebirds?
no not in the shop but i can order them for you
how soon?
well well how soon would you want them?
you are female?
immediately  is this the daily news? melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please?
i might be able to have them by tomorrow morning would that be all right?
no the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school crows i think i don't know daddy is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
there is very definitely a difference miss
they're both perching birds of course but of quite different species the crow is brachyrhynchos the blackbird is cyanocephalus
i just came from the school madam i don't know about their brain pans but
hello may i speak to mitch brenner please?  yes i'll wait
yes all right i'll wait for you goodby 
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
the gulls were after your fish mr sholes really let's be logical about this
sorrypd only
as you see
what were the crows after at the school?
what do you think they were after miss?
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose?
i don't know why
doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a a war against humanity?
have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
i have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do ornithology happens to be my avocation miss daniels you're talking about preservation of the species a hen protecting her young there's a vast difference between
maybe they're all protecting the species maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and
are you discussing gamebirds now? all birds are not gamebirds you know
then you can't come in
and what? vultures? hawks? eagles?
maybe is it impossible?
sebastian i'm not an alarmist
no one ever said you were mitch
look mitch even if this is true even if all the birds
do you believe it's true sebastian?
no i don't mitch because i can't see any reason for it
it's happening isn't that a good enough reason?
i like bodega bay as well as any man if i thought 
then help me sebastian you're an important man in this town if you'll help the rest will
i have an appointment
help how? what do you want to do?
i'm not sure but
i only know we've got to drive them away from town  before they drive us away
how?
how do you plan to do that?
how can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke?
scotch light on the water
birds?
yeah birds all they do is make a mess of everything who needs them?
we need them
no women not in boodles not since 1922
not if they're starting a war
then fight back get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth
kill them all get rid of them messy animals
that's right sir i recall it a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town where all the lights were
they made some mess too smashing into houses and everything  they always make a mess we're better off without them
how many gulls did you count mrs bundy?
which gulls mr sholes? there are several varieties
the ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats
actually those gulls must have been after the fish
of course
sir august  ? sir august  ?
makes a lot more sense than well an attack
i'm going out that way lady you can follow me
then let's go now
i haven't finished my drink
were the santa rosa police at your school today?  are you coming?
something like this happened in santa cruz last year the town was covered with seagulls
i'm leaving are you coming?
i'm donald fettes
i'm very pleased to know you master fettes
mr gray?
quite a collection
dr macfarlane said i should pay you 
i fear he may have to
but can't you give me any idea?
there master fettes  sooner than we had expected  a stoke of luck one might say
oh you'll have ample opportunity  ample   good morning dr fettes
you asked to see me ma'am?
i want you to help my little girl
i'm only a student
georgina told me how kind you were to her  it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr macfarlane
i don't know that i can do that mrs marsh
your voice  it's so familiar 
i didn't mean it that way  i meant only that i am not in a position to ask favors
ask this one favor 
you have his promise then?
 pain  and shock  she's brave enough but i don't know about myself  now that it seems so close i wonder if i dare trust my child into any but god's hands maybe he knows best
good morning mrs marsh
it's not because of georgina  because of dr macfarlane's failure?
even so i could never think of going on  i've got to find some other profession
you must leave this house
i can't do that  you heard macfarlane
save yourself master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned
congratulations mrs peel you have been a worthy opponent you have tracked us down you are within an ace of winning
he's a great doctor  a great man 
he could have been a great man  a good man and a fine doctor but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back  and always gray  gray to hound him to his death
you're overexcited mistress cameron
i'm cold as ice
but gray's only a cab driver  a resurrection man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again
if he were only that the man's evil himself some day you'll know him as macfarlane knows him  for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him that brought him close to gray he roistered with him and drank with him aye and gray even brought him to my door and my love there is all that between them and more  burke and hare and knox 
but that's long since  gray can't threaten him with that
gray has no need to threaten you remember the trial?
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums it was a famous case
and did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against burke?
this isn't a game
aye
that porter was gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it  who took my last paltry savings to hire gray 
listen to me fettes i'm one part befuddled with drink one part overheels in love with macfarlane and one part fey you're a lowlander fettes and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight
i've heard of it
he's not home
where can i find him?
you don't went to find him your news will keep until i tell him
but i must tell him  he must know of it please  tell me where he is
there's no standing between a fool and his folly if you must babble your news to him he's at the fisherman's tryst it's the inn at pennycuik you can use macfarlane's horse and gig to get there he'll welcome the ride back
at pennycuik  i know the inn  i can be there in an hour
quite right but we still make the rules
excuse me dr macfarlane 
but doctor i only wanted to speak to you 
dr macfarlane 
i'm afraid i'll have to give up medicine dr macfarlane
you're made for a doctor young man
i'm afraid i have to sir  you see my father is vicar at thrums  it's a small parish  not much of a living 
you're too good a man fettes  i'll not let you quit  i'll make an assistant of you  that'll pay your keep and your tuition too 
i thought only the best students were made assistants
well? and are you not a good student?
but richardson?
only one guys checked in?
rules are made to be broken
you know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
i don't think i can go on sir
what the devil do you mean?  you have your lodgings a certain stipend  i thought i had arranged everything for you 
and that's why you don't want to be a doctor fettes?
but this woman  and her son 
dr macfarlane  you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday  the lady with the little girl?
i remember her
she came again today  she wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate  she feels you are her only hope
it was about last night i wanted to talk to you  about the operation on the little marsh girl
you're a man of the world fettes you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink
people too
but i  well you see sir i met mrs marsh and told her
really fettes you irk me with your lack of understanding
but you did promise
look here fettes  not i nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation  i would have to study the matter  have we any "subjects"?
wilmont used up the last spinal section
you see it is completely out of the question
yes i suppose so
every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one
well 
gray killed her
then who wins?
we can't be sure of that
i wouldn't do that fettes  i wouldn't report it
i don't know that  neither do you  this subject may have been an epileptic  thrown a fit  fallen out of bed  cracked her skull and killed herself  there is everything explained  the bruise on her head 
i can't believe that
but i didn't ask him to kill
here is where you must watch closely gentleman  closely  it is the very heart of the matter 
she's unconscious
i just saw gray  what was he laughing at?
he has his own idea of a joke perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs
i've just been to see mrs marsh georgina is doing splendidly  the incision has healed  clean and fine  but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk
close we're so hushhush even we know nothing about it  now let's see there's coconut cake date and walnut; i recommend the rum baba 
when she's ready you bring her to me  i'll show her how
dr macfarlane i wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people
i suppose one must pass through this purgatory to the heaven of being a good doctor
you can't  can't  stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses let the child stand and walk  her spine's all right  i know it's all right
but she must want to stand  she must want to walk
fettes the more things are wrong the more we must act as if everything were right you must do with joseph as you did with the street singer  complete dissection  a proper entry in the book 
no
what do you mean fettes?
i'll have no more to do with it i'll not put my neck into the noose not even for your sake dr macfarlane
what's that you say?
hmmm 
the little girl  she couldn't walk far  the muscles are too weak  but she did stand and she took a step or two
i know it  i know it  the moment i was rid of him 
what?
see that fettes?
a burial party  poor people  it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely
glencorse  that's a lonely cemetery fettes not a soul around for miles
they'll be thinking of that too
tosh  fettes  it's not their grief i'm worrying about  i'm talking of our own end 
you've no thought of going there?
did you think gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  i've had some practice in the art
my number two special assignments she's 
you couldn't do that doctor
i pass up no opportunities i've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows  we'll need subjects to demonstrate come along
no
where shall we put it? in the back?
this is not a woman
it was a woman when we put her in
are you a doctor too?
not yet
what you really want to ask me is about my back isn't it  about where it hurts?
why yes
how curious 
hear him?
the white horse  the horse that is going to greet me when he sees me
why do you want the white horse to bid you "goodday"?
he was a nice horse
of course  i don't have friends that's because i can't walk  i try to make myself used to it
aye but i still wonder how much
i want it 
don't you want to find the white horse georgina?  you can't find him from a wheelchair  you have to walk and run to find him
i thought this was a school day
you'll not need that again georgina
father will be your controller steed here will show you the ropes
he'll not leave the grave  not since wednesday last when we buried the lad
not much danger here ma'am i wouldn't think  right here in the heart of edinburgh
they're uncommon bold the grave robbers  and the daft doctors who drive them on
i'm by way of being a medical myself
a doctor?
come toddy  come  sit down here with me
don't call me that confounded name
mr fettes and i have professional matters to discuss
i will not have you use that name to me
you're a teacher eh?  maybe you're afraid to be a doctor toddy
welcome to mobile hq weather's turning quite nasty sir august was blown to smithereens along with half of banffshire  the ministry's worried
afraid of what?
afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be
i am the best man for the job
you?  why?  since when have you become the protector of little children?
i'm not concerned about the child toddy  it's you i'm thinking of i'd like to see you prove that a lot of things i know haven't hurt toddy macfarlane any
i'll not do it gray
oh yes you will  you'll do it to oblige fettes and myself
no
it might be an interesting case
toddy hates me
would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
don't call me that confounded name i tell you
now that wasn't a friendly thing i heard toddy  not at all friendly
that has nothing to do with it we've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection  it's better for the students  that's all there is to it
you know what you want and don't want  so that's an end of business between us  but we'll still be friends toddy  i'll be dropping by to see you and meg once in a while  for auld lang syne you know
oh it's you gray well come in sit down have a glass with me
you know something about the human body gray
i've had some experience
then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together so that it works like that whip of yours you know that don't you?
i've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man
i set those blocks together patched the muscles i put the nerves where they should be  i did it and i did it right  and she won't walk 
yeah
london the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence if you can control the weather you control the world
oh it's the bit of a girl fettes was talking about
you can't build life like you put together blocks toddy
what are you talking about? i am an anatomist i know the body i know how it works
and you're a fool toddy  and no doctor it's only the dead ones that you know
i am a doctor i teach medicine
like knox taught you? like i taught you? in cellars and graveyards? did knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
the heart pumps it
did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
the nerve centers  the brain 
but what makes a thought start?
i resign
in the brain i tell you i know
i am a doctor  a good doctor i could make her walk but she won't  she won't 
why should i be afraid of you? what are you holding over me?
i'll tell you what toddy it's because i ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood it's because you were afraid to face it  and you're still afraid
aye toddy there is something in what you say
there is much in what i say gray and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house my school and from me
what are you going here? have i not told you 
i brought you something tonight macfarlane  an interesting specimen  in very good condition
i've ordered nothing from you
this is a gift
you need treatment mrs peel  you can't resign
i take no gifts from you
this is a gift you'll not return
get out of here
wait toddy that's not hospitable i want to discuss business
gray i must rid myself of you  you've become a cancer  a malignant evil cancer  rotting my mind
so toddy you've made me a disease eh?
surely you are not threatening an old friend toddy
have another glass of something good toddy
i've drunk enough tonight
you're getting old gray and it's a hard life driving a cab through these wet and windy streets of edinburgh 
what are you trying to do to me?
i have other means of sustenance
what i was going to say is this  wouldn't you be more comfortable at leith in a neat little house?
would you bribe me to leave you be?
i would make you rich
it wouldn't be half so much fun for me toddy as to have you come here and beg 
well then  i beg you  i beseech you 
but why gray? why?
because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more toddy you're a pleasure to me
a pleasure to torment me?
i presume you shall  this won't be my last visit here
we want to help
i want to speak to you alone  i saw something  i heard
what did you hear?
you're welcome to my little nest joseph  is it not? that's right  you have something to say to  me  something very private
yes
can anyone hear what we say?
only brother
you say you've come here on your own account?  no one knows you are here?
i have made you give me money but you smile aren't you angry?
you and i should work together
you mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? dig them up?
i thought i was a widow my husband  the only man i ever loved  is dead for the rest of my life i have to live with that
no digging joseph the churchyards are too well guarded we will "burke" them
burke them?
you are lately come to scotland joseph?
i come from lisbon
"the ruffian dogs the hellish pair  the villain burke the meager hare "
i never heard that song but what did they do?
but where did they get those people?
"a goodday to you madame tosspot and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? come with me to my house and i'll make you my guest you shall have quarts to drink if you like"  ah how he cozened them
we could do that but when he had them there then what?
i don't understand the song tell me plain how they did it
the death of peter peel was a great loss to us all 
was the paralysis immediate?
no doctor  she seemed to get better then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back 
how long after that was the paralysis complete?
nearly a year
any attacks of pain since?
yes doctor
is her pain sporadic or constant?
it comes at intervals  they used to be months apart  but they've been growing more frequent   much more frequent
child seems to take to the lad what sort of an accident was it ma'am?
a carriage overturned  my husband was killed and georgina was hurt
peter peel was a first class agent a senior operative 'x' department special operations he was engaged in top secret research top priority  government approved
how long ago?
but can anything be done for her?
believe me madame if i were only a doctor i would undertake this operation at once  but i'm more dominie than doctor  i've a school to run
but doctor surely in a case like this  a child  a little child who can never walk or run 
i regret it ma'am but i have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own
there's nothing i can say for one small child?
i'm sorry doctor  georgina's a good child  a brave child  you saw how she was during the operation  but if she can't move she can't move
but she must be able to move everything is in place
she would if she could
and why not?  he's a good lad  bright and able
the institute  the funding 
aye  he's a good lad  that's why i ask you macfarlane
you think it'll spoil the boy eh? was i not assistant to knox?
aye 
you're daft  what's gray to me he's only a man from whom i buy what i need when i need it  the rest is forgotten
you may deny the devil toddy but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead
nonsense  you're a fey creature with mad ideas  but you have a wildness that holds me to you lass
crony indeed
fettes  where is fettes?
you're not going to gray
you've been with gray again
who?
i hate that picture
where are they?
can i get you something? a glass of water? a transfusion?
where are they? last chance
around or whatever the hell you're doing here  what are you doing here?
i'm looking for my friends
how many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
you sent them i had no choice
it was one thing her dad rejected you but when she did you lost it
you're wrong
the other side of the street  the guy with the videocamera  don't look  put her in the car  stay this side
this is an official matter mrs peel no need to take it personally where are you going?
was that it? well ok
what's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace and i'll be seeing her again soon only what will i say? that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? that he's down here laughing?
tell her we'll get him
we won't
check and mate
two down two to go
"down?" wait don't tell me
you think i'm crazy
lauren's father's involved he bought the cops fancy cars i don't know what else it's a company called delt i think lauren found out
what do they do that they had to kill her?
to find out who killed my husband
i was hoping you'd find out
leonard dutton erlich they don't matter i want the king
we're getting there because in his socalled construction job tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "the hole"
the strip joint?
where is it? this place?
i think we should get some support?
that was a fucking hollow point
think maybe knives do?
keep that thing away from me
fuck what do you want?
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment
a scar on the arm of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car
you killed her i saw it
sssshhh she's resting
where the fuck did you come from?
you lied at my trial
i don't know you man
hey i said what i saw two kids arguing a guy and a girl
you said you saw me with this i never held it until today
one chance to tell the truth tommy who is the man with the scar? he planted this in my car
wrong answer
about your next assignment mrs peel 
what did they give you?
they showed me pictures what he did to her evidence said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes"
what did they give you?
we're going to play a little game called "who's got the scar"
what scar? what fucking scar?
you're him you're corvis we fried your ass you're dead man
fucking zombie
the scar
i heard you were looking for this
you're the guy killed dutton
ahem as i was saying perhaps another macaroon 
fuck me
not my arm what you fucking want?
i want lauren i want my life back i want to know why
the scar which of you has it?
are you out of your fucking mind? we're going to die
how can you die if you're already dead?
you're him corvis
i was a friend of your sister's
i know her friends
yeah no kidding
good luck  peter  emma
your father gave them to both of you
and he's right over there by the way  what did you do to your face?
someone else did it
you're a friend of the guy who killed her aren't you? you almost sound like him
he didn't kill her
how do you know?
i know everything about your sister i'll prove it to you
daisy how did you know?
i told you i knew your sister
you killed that cop dutton
you
i know who you are  that's why you paint your face to hide
i'm not hiding i'm right here
i've been shot and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt but what you're doing now does i don't know why
my dad was right he said you'd ruin her life
from the bonfire over there look at it
no why are you haunting me?
this is where it happened right over here
are you ok?
when lauren was missing the police came to our house they said they were looking for her right?  but i know now they had her and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you
no
a slight miscalculation  my face was burned beyond recognition fortunately my research into plastics came in handy 
erin it's not your fault
it's all my fault oh god i wish i were dead
no you don't
this tree here's where it happened
 took everything i ever cared about left me with nothing
so you're going to kill him?
you know what lauren and i were fighting about that night? she had a secret wouldn't tell me
my father
all i knew she was pulling away it made me crazy
i wish i could hate him but i can't he said he'd never hurt either of us and i know it's true and i'm going back
dr darling peter  all you 
it's ok it's ok
it's not i can't take it
erin who?
 it connects you to me
in the woods you said you had nothing but you wouldn't and i wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go please at least not right away
i thought we had an understanding i thought we understood that discretion is paramount
yeah we do
erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet i've got reporters asking me how much he made i've got the entire force looking at this case now
i know
you know
an unholy trinity 
tommy leonard the eyewitness in the corvis case
some hooker phoned it in there was a riot at his apartment yesterday
guy dressed for halloween?
they botched the execution
could say that
fucking crow
how about sign of a big black bird?
cause if you're losing your mind i got a right to know
just don't believe everything you see
doubt is a motherfucker
are you hit?
you killed my husband
maybe we had a case of that here  get me my kit
do you believe in ghosts nathan? because there's a ghost threatening us
you mean alex
because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident
an accident nathan
i watched her grow up just like you i know how her mind worked she kept snooping around because she was worried about you what you'd gotten yourself into so stop blaming me and blame yourself
i do every day
anything wrong?
what's with your friend there?
she's sick  actually she never had mai tais before
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
but you you've had them
if you had a license i bet i'd have seen it by now how old are you? fifteen?
you want me to walk a straight line?
i want you to bend over
look can i just call a cab?
why are there so many?
i want to take this to lauren she'd want it
honey i just can't
stay in the car i'll only take a second
erin i know you think she's been talking to you
too many cooks 
erin
what were you yelling about?
this guy said he was a friend of lauren's he had like paint all over his face
are you ok?
what is it?
what? what is it?
lauren called me that when we were little daisy no one knew but us
honey it's doesn't mean anything it's not a message
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren
it still doesn't mean
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
i think i dropped an earring
you're in with them
it's not what you think
you killed her
no
stay away from me stay away
they killed her because she found out
about you
sweetheart
i would never hurt you or lauren never believe me
but i found you all the clues led me here 
i don't believe you
please come inside
you should see it professor barnhardt you should go out and see it for yourself
thanks  i'm enjoying it right here
the whole city has stopped people are running around like ants
what about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? have they all arrived?
i talked to most of them this morning they were all very curious about the meeting
good did you speak to our friend mr carpenter?
he'll be there at 8:30
tell me hilda  does all this frighten you  does it make you feel insecure?
of course i planned that too
yes sir  it certainly does
you wrote this?
it was a clumsy way to introduce myself  but i understand you're a difficult man to see  i thought you'd have the solution by this time
yes  that will reproduce the first order terms but what about the effect of the other terms?
almost negligible with variation of parameters this is the answer
how can you be so sure? have you tested this theory?
i find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another  i understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship
as though unsure of what he's heard) yes  yes i have
you have faith professor barnhardt
it isn't faith that makes good science mr klaatu its curiosity  sit down please i have several thousand questions to ask you
but  why?
i would like to explain something of my mission here
that was my first question
it was my intention to discuss this officially  with all the nations of the earth  but i was not allowed the opportunity i have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society  we know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy we also know that you are experimenting with rockets
yes  that is true
in the hands of a mature civilization these would not be considered weapons of aggression but in the hands of your people  we've observed your aggressive tendencies and we don't trust you with such power
if you mean that you are afraid of us
we want to be sure you don't make  let us say  an unfortunate mistake we know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children you see we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years  we discarded instruments like this many centuries ago  so long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves  with your primitive tanks and planes  we were unconcerned but soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships  and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets that of course we cannot tolerate
these other planets  do they have peace and security?
we had our atomic wars  thousands of years ago  after that we fought with bows and arrows then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution  that aggression leads to chaos
we scientists understand this even we primitive scientists  what exactly is the nature of your mission mr klaatu?
you disappoint me emma  can't you guess?  for you it was all for you 
i came here to warn you that by threatening danger your planet faces danger  very grave danger i am prepared however to offer a solution
would you care to be more specific?
i gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful
i come to you as a last resort  and i confess that my patience is wearing thin  must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
what  what sort of action do you mean?
would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists i am calling together? perhaps you could explain your mission to them and they in turn could present it to their various peoples
it is not enough to have men of science we scientists are too easily ignored  or misunderstood we must get important men from every field educators  philosophers  church leaders  men of vision and imagination  the finest minds in the world
i leave that in your hands
you'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
no  not at all
'our revels now are ended'
what about your personal safety in the meantime? what about the army  and the police?
my name is carpenter and i'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house
i'm afraid i can't offer you any real protection i have no influence in cases of interplanetary conspiracy
i'm sure i'll be quite safe until the meeting
one thing mr klaatu suppose this group should reject your proposals what is the alternative?
such power exists?
the people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this they must understand what is at stake  you mentioned a demonstration of force
yes
would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
yes  of course
think of this as your second wedding feast 
something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation something that would affect the entire planet
that can easily be arranged
i wouldn't want you to harm anybody  or destroy anything
why don't you leave it to me? i'll think of something
maybe a little demonstration
bet he is mom bet he's out looking for that space man
can i help you look for the space man? can i?  i know what he looks like he's got a square head  and three great big eyes
hi mom
did you have a nice day dear?
come on bobby time to go to bed
he got my gun  motherfucker was filming the whole time
i'm already married 
mom  why does mr carpenter have to go down to the police station?
we sure had fun today we saw the space ship and we went to see professor barnhardt  and
professor barnhardt
yeah sure mom do i have to go to school tomorrow?
of course dear
go to bed darling you can finish that in the morning
bobby  i think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of mr carpenter
gee why mom? he's my best friend and he's awful good in arithmetic he even helps professor barnhardt
did you and mr carpenter really go to see professor barnhardt?
mom  is there something wrong with mr carpenter?
you know i believe she's actually jealous
what do you mean dear?
i mean  on account of that policeman last night  you think he's a bank robber maybe? or a gangster?
bobby what are you doing up at this hour?
i couldn't go to sleep mom i had to tell you
tell me what?
i followed mr carpenter  right after you left  and gee mom where do you think he went? right into the space ship
now bobby just a minute
honest mom i saw him it just opened up and he walked right in and that great big iron man was moving around
bobby you've been dreaming again
now think back hard you didn't follow mr carpenter at all did you? you haven't even been out of the house
valentine listen to me 
yes i have
he gave these to you?
gee mom do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
oh boy  can i mom?
yes dear come on now  bobby your shoes are soaking
are you an fbi man?
bobby  who's the greatest man in america today?
gee  i don't know the space man i guess
well  professor barnhardt i guess he's the greatest scientist in the world
he lives here in washington doesn't he?
right bridesmaid now what have i left out? oh yes i know: the ring
sure right near where my mother works
where is that?
boy i'll bet he's strong i bet he could knock down a whole building
gee i'd like to get inside and see how it works what do you think makes it go?
well  atomic power i would imagine
i thought that was only for bombs
no it's for a lot of other things too
you think it can go faster than an f 36?
maybe four thousand miles an hour and outside the earth's atmosphere a good deal faster
gee how could they make a landing?
that's better i say isn't this where you came in? it's impenetrable by the way 
you think they'll ever find him?
i don't know bobby i'm inclined to doubt it
mr carpenter  what does velocity mean?
bobby  i have an idea let's go see professor barnhardt and find out how he talks
you're just kidding aren't you?
wouldn't you like to meet him?
well sure i would but   aw i'll bet you'd be scared
what does that mean?
it's a problem in celestial mechanics
bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer
you're mad
did all these people die in wars?
sure didn't you ever hear of arlington cemetery?
no  i'm afraid not
mr carpenter"  you don't seem to know about anything
i'll tell you bobby  i've been away for a long time very far away
is it different where you've been?  don't they have places like this?
go to the movies
all right
no foolin'? will you?
i've got some money my mother gave me two dollars
such as?
gee  those look like diamonds
some places that's what people use for money they're easy to carry  and they don't wear out
bet they're worth about a million dollars
would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
let's not say anything to my mother about this mr carpenter
why not bobby?
mrs benson  this is mr brady
we certainly did
aw gee  we didn't finish our story
we'll finish it tomorrow goodnight bobby
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
all you have to remember is first find the common denominator  then subtract
thanks mr carpenter
bobby  have you a flashlight?
what do you want it for mr carpenter?
and the lungs are the same as ours must mean a similar atmosphere  similar pressure  how old do you think he is?
oh i'd say fortyfive
he told me this morning when i examined him he's seventyeight
i don't believe it
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty
how does he explain that?
the result would be 
my name is harley  secretary to the president  i've been told that you speak our language  that your name is mr klaatu
just klaatu
the president asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened we all feel
i'm sure i don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise  had you been traveling long?
about five months  your months
you must have come a long way
naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from
it's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor
i'm afraid in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way
the present situation?
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale you've seen a few samples
i mean the reasons for my coming here
we're very curious about that too would you care to talk about it?
i'd be glad to  not now of course  with you alone
perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the president
this is not a personal matter mr harley it concerns all the people on your planet
i  i'm not sure i understand
i want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the earth
i'm afraid that would be a little awkward it's  it's completely without precedent and there are practical considerations  the time involved  the enormous distances
i traveled 250 million miles what about your united nations?
you know about the united nations?
like you care
who's there?
then what's stopping you?
we've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years that's how we learned your languages lately we've been getting your television also
you must have a rather strange impression of us
i'm sure you recognize from our broad casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world surely you would agree
i am not concerned mr harley with the internal affairs of your planet i consider that to be your business  not mine
i was only hoping to make you understand
my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth
perhaps if you could explain a little
we could call a special meeting of the general assembly but of course the un doesn't represent all of the nations
then why not a meeting of all the chiefs of state?
i will make that recommendation to the president  i must tell you in all honesty that i'm extremely dubious about the results
the missing piece of the jigsaw i tried to get you to give it to me as peter; i tried to steal it from you as dr darling as myself i'll be a bit less subtle  with this ring my plan will be complete
apparently i'm not as cynical about earth's people as you are
good afternoon  i'm glad to see you up and around
thank you have you any news?
i tried to make you understand the suspicions  the jealousies  the mistrust  surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power
it's not your government i'm thinking about it's your world
now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the president
i will not speak to any one nation or group of nations  i don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions
our problems are very complex mr klaatu you mustn't judge us too harshly
i can judge only by what i see
your impatience is quite understandable
how wagnerian  do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? that would have amused peter
i am impatient with stupidity my people have learned to live without it
before making any decisions i think i should get out among your people  become familiar with the basis for these strange unreasoning attitudes
we're all set i picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car and the radio's still busted so me can forget about the space man for today
there's only one thing  i haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with bobby  i don't suppose we could take him with us?
well we could
it was a wonderful day
you still haven't answered my question
you know how i feel tom i just want to think it over
the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow if i could tell him i was getting married  with two dependents
you're a good salesman  but i've got to think about it
speaking of peter there's more good news: you won't even have to change your last name you'll always be mrs peel
hello
you ready?
i will be in just a minute
the picture starts at eightfifty
i was talking to mr carpenter
oh tom that was awful
he's not there  but look what i found in his room
is it real?
i wonder if we ought to
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight
what are my choices?
you think it's all right for you to stay here?
i'm at bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond i thought we might have lunch together
tom  i've been trying to get you all afternoon
i've got some terrific news about your friend mr carpenter
what about him?
helen he's the man from the space ship  i had that diamond checked at three different places nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that after what bobby told us that's enough for me why is it nobody knows anything about him? why hasn't he got any money?
all right tom  it's true i know it's true
how do you know?
never mind about that  you've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody
are you crazy? after what happened today?
choices?
you don't understand you don't realize how important it is
important? of course it's important the point is we can do something about it
that's what i'm trying to tell you we mustn't do anything about it believe me tom i know what i'm talking about
he's a menace to the whole world it's our duty to turn him in
but he isn't a menace he told me what he came here for
he told you don't be silly honey  just because you like the guy  you realize what this'd mean for us? i'd be the biggest man in the country i could write my own ticket
is that what you're thinking about?
tom you mustn't   you don't know what you're doing it isn't just you and mr carpenter the rest of the world is involved
you'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers
i feel different right now
doctor peel i presume?
you wait and see you're going to marry a big hero
i don't know how to thank you
everyone seems so 
bobby's the only person i know who isn't  jittery
he has his homework to keep him occupied
he's a fine boy mrs benson
naturally i think so
mr carpenter  this is none of my business but  why did that detective come here last night?
excuse me i was just going up to my room
mr carpenter i  goodnight
i was about to throw in the towel
oh  hello
may i see you for a minute?
i  i was just going to lunch
i saw bobby this morning before he went to school
yes?
i want to know what he told you last night
i  i didn't really pay much attention  bobby has such an active imagination
what is it you want?
what happened?
just twelve
i had a spot of bother at the door
we'll be stuck here for a little while  about thirty minutes
we could try pushing the other buttons  i have a flashlight in my purse
why not?
you hold great hope for this meeting
it must be twelvethirty
where are you going now?
no wait a minute  there's someone else
who?
i'm sure barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting
where is the meeting going to be?
i shouldn't wonder not a woman inside boodles since 
it's only a few blocks to barnhardt's
i'm worried about gort i'm afraid of what he might do  if anything should happen to me
gort?  but he's a robot i mean  without you what could he do?
there's no limit to what he could do he could destroy the earth  if anything should happen to me you must go to gort you must give him this message: "klaatu barada nikto" please repeat that
"klaatu barada nikto"
hello
i  i thought you were
i was
you mean he has the power of life and death?
no  that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit
police  we'd like to ask you a few questions
1922 why the kippers?
this technique in certain cases can restimulate life for a limited period it's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people
but how  how long?
we'll miss you very much  bobby and i  he won't have anyone to play with
he'll have you  and tom
no that's all finished
i'm sorry
how dare you write on that blackboard  do you realize the professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
he'll catch on to it in no time now
how did you get in here? and what do you want?
we came to see professor barnhardt
red herring would have been too obvious don't you think?
well he's not here and he won't be back till this evening  i think you'd better leave now unruffled klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad he tears off the piece of paper and hands it to hilda
is it worth anything?
i have never seen such a stone will you please tell me where it came from?
that's what i wanted you to tell me
you sure about that?
would you like to sell it?
no  no thanks
the professor's secretary says she found you in barnhardt's room making marks on his blackboard
oh i see he was having trouble and you were helping him out
that's right
so what was all this  some sort of test?
i suppose you know that barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the army
in this case the secret wouldn't be worth much he doesn't know the answer himself
but i suppose you know the answer
your name's carpenter  that right?  any identification mr carpenter? driver's license  social security number?
no  i'm afraid not
well how do i know who you are?
okay  book him and get him fixed up  looks like everybody's goin' nuts
they would have killed this man?
people get hysterical enough they do anything  look mr carpenter  if you can't identify yourself i got to send you over to the army
how long will that take?
congratulations you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition doctor
may i suggest that you call the professor?
just passing through santa carla?
i don't like horror comics
how do you like santa carla?
yeah you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad huh?
we're fighters for truth justice and the american way
i don't like horror comics
think of this more as a survival manual there's our number on the back and pray that you never need to call us
all day
can't stand light?
whereas you are
salt sticks to the bottom of his feet
yeah
why not?
he's my brother
they wouldn't be out in the daytime
<u>i'll</u> have to drive
we don't ride with vampires
burn rubber does not mean <u>warp</u> <u>speed</u>
they're gaining on us
well we blew plan a
dyed in the wool but i can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules
time to activate plan b
we've been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time
santa carla has become a haven for the undead
all together?
okay  where's nosferatu?
the prince of darkness
the nightcrawler  the bloodsucker
should i run him through?
shut up
we unraveled in the face of the enemy
rules are made to be broken
they're looking at us
good
did you see that sucker burn?
man we totally annihilated his nightstalkin' ass
two down and two to go
<u>four</u> to go
whattaya mean?
those two we brought back with us the girl and the kid  i don't trust 'em  i say we terminate 'em while we can
death to all vampires
maximum bodycount
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
we are awesome monsterbashers
the meanest
we still going?
honda 250 huh?
that's right
c'mon star  climb on
i can't beat a triumph

are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
this is just our cover  we're dedicated to a higher purpose
i have nothin' to say  if you wanna contact my attorney
under the circumstances you may call me mrs peel
bad breath?  long fingernails?
get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart
i have something to tell you guys  not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire but now i'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one
that is very probable  what's your reasoning?
i wish they were vampires so i could nuke them in their hearts
he's not glowing
he's telling the truth  aren't you michael?
just so you know:  if you try to stop us or vampout in any way i'll stake you without thinking twice about it
what's that smell?
i thought they'd be in coffins
much better
oh no

no nanook  quiet
we don't have one yet  and we only have two and a half hours to come up with one
what happens in tow and a half hours?
of course not
david

i said <u>i'll take you there</u> nobody's going near star without me
don't go out there  stop him
and now that we've settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
lucy you're the only woman i ever knew didn't improve her situation by getting divorced
ouch my hair
i can't sleep with the closet door open either  not even a crack  your father doesn't mind though it could be wide open for all he cared  i think one of the reasons i divorced him was because he never believed in the horror of the <u>closet monster</u>
dad  don't sneak up on people like that
smells good  when do we eat?
i told max eight o'clock
max?  you men we're having company again?
'again'?  dad you haven't had company in this house since mom died eight years ago

well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen
nanook stop breathin' on me
oh no  now what?
what did you say?
vampires mom  everywhere you've got to tell the police the newspapers  the tv stations they'll listen to you  they'll believe you  you're a <u>mom</u>

this is not a joke  they know that we know about them  they're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark
stop it sam  stop it right now
but mom
steed we really must be 
not another word  i can't believe you're doing this  i'm going to see max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again

there's nothing wrong with max  i don't know why you don't 
ohmygod
mom
you've got a generous nature  i like that in a person  my name is max
lucy

i'm not looking for a tape  what i need is 
 a job
you can but i wish you wouldn't 
say hello to thorn
you're cute max
not impressed are you?
so i've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me
you seem like a terrific guy max and i'm grateful for the job
but i don't think it's what you really want to do is it?
i guess if i had my choice i'd like to do something that involves children  work with kids in some way  teenagers maybe  and santa carla seems to be full of them
yeah  runaways mostly  they come from all over  attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean  lucy listen i know i have no right to ask you this but don't look for another job just yet i mean besides being the best employee i have i think you're cute
is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
you're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding
that place is so absurd so out of date 
this looks terrific lucy
max  what's wrong?
i'm really sorry max
our batting average isn't very good is it?  so far we're zero for two
i don't understand sam  he's just not like this
boys sam's age need a good deal of discipline or they walk all over you
he doesn't walk all over me
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change
something the matter?
no no  just worrying about my boys  as usual
you know what i mean this car  and you nobody walks around like that milk?
let me tell you something about boys  they're like weeds  they grow best when they're ignored
i thought you said they needed discipline?
max what are you talking about?
will somebody please tell me what this is all about?
how about a little parmesan cheese on that?
does it burn?
i am?
but you passed the test
michael invited me in  never invite a vampire into your house it renders you powerless
are you following me?

clark did you notice anything strange about that dog?  just anything at all?  any little thing?
that night?
yeah
they call me in when they've reached a dead end freelance like yourself
what was he doing in the rec room?
well after i worked on him  thought i'd let him rest  left the room for a bit  when i came back he was gone
well where was he?  where did he go?
don't know  looked for him for a bit couldn't find him
how long were you with the dog? alone i mean?
what the hell you looking at me like that for?
was that dog the norwegian dog?
couldn't make much of it myself
i've asked him to try and locate the site  okay with you?
sure  you think there's a connection?
i have no choice why should you risk your life?
look i know it's hard to believe
so what's our problem?
 it could have gotten to somebody
anybody sick?
listen to me garry  please
don't you understand?  that thing didn't want to become a dog
damn you blair  you've already got everybody halfhysterical around here
you can't let anybody leave
whatever that norwegian dog was it it was capable of changing its form   when it attacked our dog it somehow was able to digest or absorb it and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly   this for instance isn't dog at all  it's imitation we got to it before it had time to finish or
finish what?
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea?
what you doin'?
nobody's getting in here  you can tell them all that
now why'd you go and
and i don't want any more food with sedatives in it  i know what you're up to  don't think i don't  and if anyone tries to get in here  i've got rope  i'll hang myself before it gets to me
too damn dangerous
 can't you see?  if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth nothing could stop it  nothing
look blair maybe you're right about this  but we've got to be rational we've got to talk this over  i'm unarmed and i'm coming in
how you doin' old boy?
i don't know who to trust
know what you mean blair  trust is a tough thing to come by these days just trust in the lord
no thanks
watch clark
what?
i've changed my mind i'd i'd like to come back inside i don't want to stay out here any more funny things i hear funny things out here
have you come across fuchs?
fuchs?  no it's not fuchs you must let me back in i won't harm anyone i promise

according to mother sir august owns half of the highlands a millionaire former head of special projects at the ministry now 
childs
let go of me
don't get near 'em  the plants they're alive  those things can imitate anything
we got to burn 'em
why didn't it imitate fuchs?  isn't that its number  to get more recruits
could have been anytime  anywhere
let's open it
let's open it  now
why you so damn anxious to let him in here
he's so close  maybe our best chance to blow him away
not so much eccentric more barking mad he has a wife called june and a daughter somewhere  julie
you catch anything he was saying?
i suppose well it's possible someone might have lifted it from me  but
that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt  now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
i said where?  where'd you go?
was dark find a light
lighten your load sucker  you ain't the judge and executioner around here

somebody's taken it  i can't find it
cut him loose of the line up by his shack
cut him loose?
what's happening?
torch it over there
the dogs?
macready
look i'm just guessing
 so it crashes and this guy whoever he is gets thrown out or walks out and ends up freezing
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined
yeah they dig him up and cart him back  he gets thawed out wakes up and scares the shit out of them and they get into one hell of a brawl
now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice huh?
i don't know how  because he's different than we are  because he's a space guy  what do you want from me anyway  go ask blair
i can get maybe another five or six feet out of it
where's the other half?
what we going to do?
torch them
but
what do we do about those three?
macready
any other vices?
what?
garry's missing
oh shit  well hang on
well who says i want you going with me?
 nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline
what are you doing?
we found your clothes  the ones you tried to burn
what clothes?
 ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up
palmer you and copper tie everyone down  real tight
so  i distract him while you snoop around? how?
what for?
you ain't tying me up
then i'll have to kill you
we should have jumped his ass
load of bullshit
spaceship of some kind
i think so
not the only one
the fire's got the temperature way up all over camp won't last long though
neither will we
ah brenda   mrs peel?
maybe we should try and fix the radio try and get some help
maybe we shouldn't
maybe we shouldn't make it
if you're worried about anything let's take that blood test of yours
screw regulations  four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there
my god what in hell happened here?
hey sweden
anything?
what are you doing?
could be important work  might as well bring it back
you should be dead  how do you feel?
well who's got access to it?
would that test have worked?
now hold him
i'm a real light sleeper childs
and if anyone tries to wake me
i guess you're okay
thank you
 guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us
nothing we can do about that
yes there is  i'd like to go up
strange
in this weather?
goes on like that quite awhile  what do you gentlemen make of it?
hold on damn it  we're getting nowhere if this bit of blair's about absorbing and imitating is true then that dog could have gotten to anybody
how long will it take you to prepare this?
a couple of hours
can there be some kind of test? to find out who's what?
i don't see how when i'm finished i return it right away
when was the last time you used it?
i'm getting worried about you  you ought to have a checkup
let's just not get worried about anything just now
you were very lucky  four shots to the heart i found you after i slipped away from sir august mother brought you here not me you should thank
after all this mess then
gotta be from the norwegian camp
how far's that?
'bout eighty kilos southwest
how many in their party?
right  why not?
hey man

we're a thousand miles from anybody else man  it's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better
couple seconds of an argentine disco station
i wasn't about to
put that down

look if you're going to keep bitching macready  palmer's offered to take him up
we're on fire
don't let up childs
you're not thinking of going after them are you?
get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles
you're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got
ah no one i give it to copper when he needs it
let's rush him  he's not going to blow us all up
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
pure nonsense  this won't prove a damn thing
looks good
how long's it been?
four
what's
oh i got you  not too long

copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight
no it ain't there  would i be asking if it were there?
sanchez?  hey who
do you have any czech girls working for you?
mother and dr darling have me under observation they think i tried to kill you
somebody definitely messed with it

he's dead
how we going to try and find out who's you know who's who?
where were the flashlights?
we've got to find fuchs  when we find him  we kill him
why?
why should they think that?
what if it doesn't come?
he might just wait us out
that thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes macready
this storm do that?
 hey somebody  open up it's me macready   come on damn it the towline snapped  been crawling around like a seal out here
we're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood

where was he trying to go?
what about childs?
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead

calm down and get in your position
maybe it ain't coming
then we go after him
you jerking off or just pissed?
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
frankly that's how i remember it
get your gear on
magnesium of some type or some kind of strange alloy  and those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it
so what do you make of it?
you know damn well what we both make of it
somebody else sure as hell thought so
we should sleep in shifts
what's happened?
macready that you?
yeah
it's the generator i think  no power
but that's absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but it's not my style
 made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back cut him loose
macready?
he's one of them
you hear that?
it's got into the pub  it's turned on the stereo
what?
it's in between us and them  how we going to get back?
it must have been hard leaving your work
now how did you get hurt?
i had an accident
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
what do you do on the towers?
on the towers?
ah no
don't tell me you're a mud carrier
 thousands and thousands of people  and sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories
and everyone looks like us?
she didn't want me to be a climber she wanted me to be a planner like her
how can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
what else can they do?
kalen do you have any idea where they take them?
that's possible sir august was convinced he'd met me before but i'd never met him another odd thing when it rained he said it was just as someone had promised
there's a place that might help we could try going there
where?
the hall of books
you have books?  kalen you've got to take me there  there might be history  records  something to help us find where the morlocks took 
no one ever comes here  my mother told me stories about it late at night  they tell all the children
what kind of stories?
i had a friend who came here once sort of a dare
what happened?
i think we should go on by ourselves
no
did he say who?
please just listen to me your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt  i'll find her
but you're only a mud carrier
 well you wanted to see it
this is it?
yes  just about here
right up your alley i would think you are from the past yes?
how did you know?
i can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for    800000 years perhaps  don't keep me in suspense  what year?
1899
i must say you look remarkably good  you don't want a book then?
an invitation to a 'formal picnic'?
what are you?
i'm the librarian  i've always been the librarian
i know you  you're an automaton of some sort that 
sir have you a name?
please we need your help  the morlocks have taken 
morlocks 
you know of them?
who doesn't know the morlocks?
do you know where they live?
oh yes they found our knowledge useful for a time  they used us much as your people did  then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts
i must say you look more your old self 
but you escaped
i was lucky  the others weren't
regenerating fission reactor you wouldn't understand  it's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity
we need your help
because you'll never die
excuse me?
so relic you want to open pandora's box do you?  see all the mysteries exposed?
yes
and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
when was his mother taken?
no
you mean my other self 
last night
send him away
what?
send him home  you don't want him to see it
my god i saw this
it frightens you
yes
so do we go on?
yes
aren't you a plucky little  ?
either way  may i ask: why you dress in that fashion?
it's what they want you to see
this is the way in?
yes are you sure you want to do this?
in for a penny in for a pound  do you know that saying?
machines?
yes
vox?
what's it all for?
the air the power
why did they built it?
colonel crabtree international satellite systems formerly of the ministry
alexander listen to me it was wrong to bring you  you're not going to find what you're looking for
what do you mean?
they raise them like cattle feed them until they're ready and then hunt them
no
this has to end
end?
vox 
takes a licking but keeps on ticking   for a while anyway
what can i do?  tell me what to do
nothing to do i'm afraid  i'm just a librarian after all  wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling  very byronic end though  i appreciate that  do you know byron?
elementary mrs peel trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade 
vox
i'm babbling  good to have someone to talk to for a change but you need to go  take her out of here   i don't have long
i won't leave you like this
go back to the light  you weren't made for this  i was i was made for this moment
i don't understand
now get out of my sight you hideous primate
i'll never forget this
i should hope not   alexander make them read my books  tell them who they are who they could be
what's your name?
alexander
what on earth?
well alexander as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions 
you came underground when the world was ending above  and you evolved some into the morlocks and others 
no we created the morlocks
created?
you wouldn't understand  we genetically engineered the morlock class to serve our needs
as slaves
and centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again we couldn't  our adaptation was too successful  we survived we endured for this
how do you control the morlocks?
we make them see what we wish
how?
any ideas?
and what of the eloi?
they survived above  became what they are
no they didn't survive only to be your food  you did that
i'm afraid your indignation is lost here  i have no more "human" response to the eloi then you would have to a carrot  it's just how we live now
but this is barbaric  have you completely lost all sense of 
and who are you alexander?  who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  this is the world now  i am fact
what?
go back to where you came from  or die here
why would you let me go back?
say i just come back again?
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society 
alexander yours is a world of brocade and velvet not tooth and claw  why would you come back to this?  to save a few cattle?  no
why?
we have lost the capacity to reproduce  but the species must continue
so you take their best
when a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool  we're breeding them for submission  soon they will be fully domesticated
you took her because she helped me
she won't remember you  none of them will  you will be forgotten that is how history works
a man can change his history
now will you go?
if i can only find the right door the lady or the tiger
is that written in his shoe?
no
that was a foolish thing to do
i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds
i know
i'm tired of running
but you've earned a reward for your valor  i think you should become you'll like it here  once you get used to the darkness
i don't think that's going to happen
and why not?
it's spectacular
thanks  old nell's my girl all right  al least when she decides to move stubborn beast
common knowledge mrs peel 
i've only read about them  and the new internals
now that's what i call plain crazy  internal combustion is just too dangerous all those little explosions never catch on
how do you keep the water temperature stable?
god  could have killed me  bad girl nell  how did you know to do that?
i just love mechanical things
well much obliged  i'm always forgetting the confounded brake  say if you wait until i get her up and running i'll give you a perambulation  tell you all about her
ahhh i'm afraid i've got a prior commitment
next time then  we perambulate here most every night
may i help you?
i  what are you?
for you mrs peel
i am the fifth avenue public library informational kiosk  vox registration ny114  may i help you?
the 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies  can i tell you more?
no  wait  the moon's falling out of orbit  that's not possible
well considering it is in fact happening i would assume it's possible  the retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies 
why is it  breaking up?
you're late
got here as soon as i could
dance with me
you know i can't
you promised me flowers
boy she's so popular all the sudden
but
what?
you promised me flowers tonight don't you even remember?
sorry i was distracted
well there's something new
i need to um talk to you
talk away professor
 orion's belt pointing to the earth  you see it over the rocks there?  sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels are you listening to me alex?
what?  yes  orion  good fortune  sailors
all right what is it now?
emma you know i have great admiration for you
not quite this is my field
admiration?  my my
i mean well affection
oh dammit i love you  i can't eat i can't sleep i can't think all i do is moon over you and  hum apparently
you know the moment is rather dying here
i know it's not a diamond but 
a moonstone
you're late
got here as soon as i could
dance with me
you know i can't
is there anything that isn't?
alex what is it?
holding you again
darling
i need to talk to you
all right
let's walk through the park
no let's walk through the city
alex what is it?
alex?
why do we have to race for heaven's sake?
the prospero project was started by my husband it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming in theory climate engineering is entirely feasible we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite a 'quick fix'
my god
you're so pale i hope you're not coming down with something
no i'm fine  i'm   wonderful  just walking down the street with you again
we took a walk three days ago
they are rare   orion's belt pointing to the earth 
the sailor's omen of good fortune the hunter watching over him on his travels
heavens look at that now
now i know you're ill  passing up the chance to explore some new gadget
alex people are staring
let them
filling in mother nature's blind spots  ?
 the point is i know it will work once the um numbers and such are in order
do you know you were humming?
i was not
somewhere around "d+2xy something something"
damned if i can keep her out of my equations
tonight's the night?
 one day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him the thick brow so lacking in imagination  the dim little eyes devoid of curiosity
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers
where's the challenge in that?
alex this is your first year as an associate professor  you might want to play things a little more conservatively
exactly there'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea propane gas mostly in small quantities it captures chlorine protects the ozone layer but it proved impractical too bulky 
look at them philby all alike everyone in an identical bowler hat  do you want your students to turn out like them?
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge
i don't  i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see
you may not like it but this is the world we live in alex  little grey men with little grey hats
in the future we'll be better
what?
emma actually likes chalk dust  says it smells like me
the most able inventor i know and you can't tie a simple fourin hand
that's how i knew we were destined to be together  when i met her parents for the first time i came right from class and i was covered in chalk  they sniffed and snorted but she just smiled  at that moment  i just knew  how did you know with molly?
she made the best shepherd's pie i ever tasted
but if someone miniaturized the process
do you have a romantic bone in your body?
alex really good luck tonight she's a fine girl and she's done wonderful things for you
oh?
all these clocks  how can you constantly be running late?
i've been working
i came by the house every day after the funeral  and then every week then every other month  then i stopped coming  did you even notice?
i'm sorry david
it hurt me alex  very much
it's my jamie's birthday today your godson  he's nine years old at his party he asked me if uncle alex was coming  i told him no then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore
for god's sake david 
that's what we were working on
there are some things i need to say to you  you may not like hearing them but i don't know if i'll ever get another chance 
you care for me  and you're concerned  and i have to start living my life again  i hear it from mrs watchit every day
but you won't listen  you won't see me you won't see anyone  what would you like me to tell jamie? that uncle alex is busy?  that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory 
hiding?
you know that's what it is  mrs watchit tells me you're here at all hours  day and night 
that's because i'm working  you remember that?  you used to care about your work
what happened to emma will never go away  it's part of you now and it always will be  but you have to learn to live with it
i live with it every minute of every day
i know that 
you don't know that  you couldn't possibly  if i'd only done this or that if i'd arrived ten minutes earlier or later  if we'd taken a different path or i hadn't fought the man for the ring  you have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night  consider every action you made  and every one of them wrong
three agents killed by bad weather
it wasn't your fault alex
wasn't it? i have a dream almost every night now  the lady and the tiger you remember that story?  in the dream i'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors behind every door save one is a tiger  i have to make the decision  which door conceals emma?  and i just stand there looking at the doors
alex nothing will ever change what happened but 
david i appreciate your concern i do  but i ask you to have faith in me  just for a little while longer  i'm working on something now  something extraordinary
what is it?
you wouldn't believe me
i would
i'll tell you what come by for dinner in a week and i'll show you
why don't you come to our house instead?
i can't do that 
 and by you mrs peel 
when's the last time you were outside this house    or this room?
i can't leave when i'm so close
there are trains leaving grand central every then minutes  a dozen liners leaving the harbor get on one of them  go to singapore scotland manchuria anywhere just away from here 
that's absurd 
you won't say that in a week
all right  i'll come for dinner and in the meantime you'll think about what we discussed?
good night david
and this would be my study  there was an elm tree outside the window then
this was my home
couldn't help but overhearing  two fine young people starting out on the road of life  i wish you the very best
what are you saying?
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 
thank you
i hope it's a happy journey for you both  and much as i hate to do this moved as i am by your protestations of love i'll be needing your money now
sir?
and your jewelry too  i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss
did you hear me lad?
you're up  you must be feeling better 
how long did you travel?
yes
is there a lot of illness?
his curiosity is amazing
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters?  no undiscovered twin?
kalen will tire you out if you let him  he's always been curious his father was firm with him but it's just his way
your husband is dead?
it's hard for me to imagine a better place  where i come from there's so much frenzy  day and night  it seems we're all running faster and faster   all in identical bowler hats
you're not from beyond the valley
we don't have anything like this or the machine where kalen found you  and i doubt they do beyond the valley now where do you come from?
you might find the truth rather hard to understand
oh that explains everything
i know it's hard to believe but it's true
that machine 
allowed me to travel from my time to yours
not that i know of  explanation?
how long ago?
why?
why not?
i might find the truth rather hard to understand? can you go back?
yes  or forward into the future i suppose i really should check on the machine see that it hasn't been damaged
i'll take you tomorrow you must have seen a lot on your journey
is he all right?
i'm going to sit with kalen  keep the fire burning if you can
i'll take you to your machine tomorrow
you seem fascinated by the stars
is that what you think?
you can see so many here
don't then have stars where you come from?
good night then
mara i had a strange dream last night  i was here walking through a forest very much like this and then
then you came to a desert and mountains
yes
and you saw a shape ahead of you
yes
we all have that dream
all of you?
do you always drive this fast?
every night
you share dreams?  that's incredible
this is magnificent
thank you
and this is your "work"?
the mud carriers
i can see kalen's point
want to be a high climber now do you?
what you need is an engineer  if you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights some basic block and tackle mechanism you could to this a lot more easily
it's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be beautiful
what lady disdain? are you yet breathing?
what's it all for?
i don't understand
i mean why do you do it?  what purpose does it serve?
it has no purpose  it's just beautiful does everything have a purpose where you come from?
most things  we're very high on purpose
it's always been this way here  we work on the towers all our lives when we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors
or mud carriers
and there's no shame to that  it's all the same here  everyone has an important job to do  we all work together and couldn't survive without each other
what are you?
i'm a planner  i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like
barely
how do you decide?
 it was a great city  the greatest city in the world
you liked it there
oh very much   i used to work somewhere in that direction i think  a huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature
learning was important?
oh very  learning commerce the arts  the whole place was buzzing all the time  night and day
did you have fires at night?
only to keep warm  for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night
it must have been safe
oh it was   most of the time
this must be the last straw
it sounds like a wonderful place to live
alexander?
those rocks over there they're the same this is central park
you know this?
this is where my journey started right here
you lost someone
yes
someone you loved very much
yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better
is it?
here's the one that broke the camel's back
you've welcomed me into your home into your lives  everyone has for the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much  i thank you for that
good  it looks fine  we had quite a ride together
it's undamaged?
yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape
so you can use it now?
yes i suppose so
go back to your own time?
alexander take my son away  take him back to your time  will you do that?
mara 
kalen
someone didn't want us to get to the party
mara?
mara  what  ?
it was different then
oh huzzah the master's home
do you have it?
don't torture me  do you have it?
i have it but don't you think for one moment i'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat  now go upstairs and change  i've laid out your green coat
now that's more like it  you look a proper gentlemen for once
then if emma turns me down will you marry me?
oh i'm already swooning
i do care but i'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s 
he said he was her cousin  i told him where she works  they were just here
steed  
sir mr philby is here
here?
yes sir he 
all right mrs watchit  you can go
may i get you some 
dr philby dr hartdegen  i received the most extraordinary letter last week  from a parent we are always pleased to receive letters from parents  they are our employers after all  this gentleman's son is in your class dr hartdegen
i see
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "applied mathematics and engineering" am i correct?
well just as i thought  surely it's all been a terrible mistake this parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics
imagine that
where am i?
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum
well perhaps i have "deviated" the tiniest bit
might i ask why?
sir that curriculum is forty years out of date  the students today are looking toward the new century  they want to be challenged and inspired not spoonfed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times  they want to explore
and roosters
no dr hartdegen they are not just chickens and roosters  they are science  perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you  perhaps they don't "challenge" you 
no sir 
animal husbandry is science dr hartdegen  i have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years  i have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns social behavior and breeding  empirical exacting quantifiable records
with respect sir would we have the telegraph without fantasy? would we have radium and xrays without someone first dreaming we could?
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation a careful evolutionary process not chalkboard parlortricks
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists i'm so sorry i struck you mrs peel please forgive me i thought you were someone else 
my equations are not parlortricks
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical "durations"  even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point?
yes sir
and hungry i'd say  you had such a long journey
i did
"eloi"?
what are your people called?
well i guess you'd call us new yorkers
we had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago his name was moren  do you know him?
no
was i?
he said he traveled for two months
oh very different  but not entirely i mean we have lots of um trees and such  but not everywhere  and more roads  and buildings
why?
to live in  there's a lot of us beyond the valley
new yorkers
i am the oldest
no i mean someone considerably older  your father perhaps?
my father has gone to a better place
i'm sorry i didn't mean to
good morning alexander  feeling up to some work?
i expect that's for you to know and me to find out 
where do they take them?
we don't know
we have to go after them find where  
alexander i know you're trying to help  but they don't come back
what do you mean?
they've gone to a better place
you know that's not true
we choose to believe it
this is out life alexander  it's a hard life but it is how we have always lived
then it's time to change that 
you followed me
you won't even try?
my fowl have polluted the yard
sir if i may 
if i might explain sir 
you supported his application dr philby  you are his senior advisor  i depend upon you to restrain his excesses  any repetition of the behavior i witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both
yes sir
how did you get hurt?
kalen
i found you  i saved your life you were bleeding all over the place
what did you do at night?
orders
we'll see about that
i want to see your home  will you take me?
kalen right now you need to go up to bed  you're exhausting alexander
kalen it's all right i'm here 
they're here  they're inside the house  
no you're safe 
they're inside 
hello mrs watchit  you're looking in the pink
i wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
i don't know what to tell you sir he's been gone this whole week
to kill me?
and you've no idea where he went?
sir?
i think i might be  but there'll be some changes made  i run a tight house
i have no doubt of that  i'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it  goodnight mrs watchit
you ok?
i'm fine
[beat] listen i hate to bother you
then don't
but what about starks?
what about starks?
i could save you the trouble
should we be
should we be what? trying to change him any way we can? [beat] yes
don't get all worked up justin i expected some common sense on your part and clearly i was expecting too much [beat] just open the drawer
we never should have done this to him
well your condition's pretty serious
[beat] so they say [off becker's steady gaze] what?
i'm just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable?
you said you couldn't remember killing officer harrison correct?
[beat] you don't believe me do you?
he's recovering on the third floor
no trouble
are you kidding me? he's not psychotic
i don't know better all i know is that you left me in there
in where?
we were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to
that wasn't a fucking restraint
relax
don't act like i don't know what's real [beat] i'm not the one that's crazy here
you're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition
i didn't dream it i may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream becker sits down in a chair halfshrouded in the light
i had a patient a few years ago his name was ted casey
describe him
because you always obey orders 
i don't give a shit about your patient
we are not birds of a feather
long live the organization for the organized
hello william i understand you've been asking for me almost every hour i would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about
that's too bad
it is but when it comes down to it you just have to patient with them they'd rather have their vacation too so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the new year
they make it hard for you to get away with your business huh?
and what's that?
my business?
yes
yes  ?
getting away with things like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison
i'll say a prayer for you in church today starks maybe the gods can pick up where the medicine left off
you sure you know where to find one?
i've managed to every sunday of my life [beat] some of us are god fearing men starks
and what does that mean?
becker how do you sleep at night?
who are you?
i think you know your eyes say you do
[beat] you're his son?
no i'm not his son i'm him [beat] what? you look like you've seen a ghost you can come here and touch me old man i'm the real thing
and do you trust me?
you died starks years ago in the hospital
i know [beat] you killed me didn't you?
no i didn't i swear i didn't i probably helped push you to kill yourself but i didn't do it
i don't know how you died the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer
i didn't say i remembered killing him i just repeated some words to get myself back in there
i know [beat] i knew that when you came out
how?
of people like you people i was just trying to help they couldn't get worse so i thought with medication they might get
medication? what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
it was part of the treatment i intendedi didn't know what the effects would be
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out?
the three of you weren't regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
how did you come to know their names?
you just told me the last time i was with you was when i was in the jacket i'm in it right now dr becker
i don't understand
i'm in it as we speak [beat] you're haunting yourself right now [beat] i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does you didn't make history like you wanted to huh dr becker it turned out different didn't it?
i didn't put you in alpine grove
do i know you from somewhere?
that's right goddamn you're the spitting image i didn't know he had a son
did you know my father?
mmm  what are you doing?
my father used to talk about you
look here i don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me
that's too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
i didn't [beat] did you have anything to do with his death?
he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head someone had to have given him it
we're late
i wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have
it's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about
what should they be looking for?
keeping a stiff upper lip?
where? [beat] it's becker isn't it? he's doing stuff isn't he?
you look like you've lost some weight are you eating?
you done with your small talk?
sure
this is really happening isn't it?
[beat] what do you need me to do?
i need to get this letter to someone
i can't take you out of here in your condition
and i can't stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight it's already been decided
no it hasn't
but you did suspect me
i'm sorry i can't tell you more about your father's death mr starks our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the alpine grove's staff changed and i'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then
his body was found on january 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died?
no i don't i'm sorry i wish i knew more
what about dr thomas becker or dr loel lorenson? there was also a dr gries i think
well dr lorenson is still here at the hospital if she was here at the time your father was then i'm sure she'd be of more help to you
what about dr becker and mr gries?
get your fucking hands off my daughter
mom he just fixed our car
i'm sorry? your face looks awfully familiar i just can't quite place it
mom this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway the guy you yelled at for no good reason
not for a moment
jackie go play in the snow
why?
come on mom don't fall asleep
you two ok?
your mom take anything before this happened?
yeah but i don't know what
[beat] what's your name?
but i like it i guess
hey can you reach the gas pedal?
you're just gonna walk?
you're playing games
what're those?
dog tags [off her blank look] they've got your name and date of birth for identification
what for?
i think i can remember what's on them
what'd you do? snoop all over the place? you had no right you had no right to go through anything
[beat] i know it doesn't make sense it doesn't even make sense to me
jackie i'm william starks i can prove it
what? now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
no i don't have anything to show you i'm here from a mental hospital
stop it stop it jackie covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes starks' eyes plead right back
aren't we all mrs peel?
i'm sorry for upsetting you [beat] but i'm not lying to you
you can't be william starks he's dead
[beat] what?
william starks is dead [beat] i've been to his grave
[beat] what?
i looked it up
i gave you my dog tags
no you didn't they found william starks' body dead in the snow
how'd he die?
i don't know but he did die starks falters under the news jackie looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up
tall shorthaired scary eyes  second guy with him wasshorter with a wrestler's build  and he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me
i thought you played by the rules
i know what this isi picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought i'm just fucked up enough to fall for this but the thing is i know what i'm doing when i drink i just usually don't care right now i do though and i want you out now
it's december 25th 1993 today
i'm telling you i don't care what time you think you're in you're not william starks [beat] i don't believe in many things but i believe in death and it doesn't give back what it takes so whoever you arei did a nice thing you've made me regret it enough already so please just leave
i'll leave but look at me look at my face jackie i'm not lying i met you and your mother i told you then that i'd lost my memory [beat] there was no one for miles around so i know you know there's no way i could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around
the jacket that's what they call it right?
yeah
but no one knew until after
[beat] you bled to death
what?
do you really believe me?
i thought you didn't
[softly] i want to trust you should i trust you?
yes
then we need to figure out what happened to you it's the only thing we can do
i know
alpine grove still exists i looked it up on the net we should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you
i didn't kill officer harrison
i know
how? did they figure it out after i died?
i don't believe a thing she just said
me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene?
i'm playing to win
i have no idea
you think lorenson kills you?
maybe i don't know seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died
let's see if they have an address for becker i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with
why?
how long do we have?
i don't know
what about captain medley? he never told them what happened to you over there his testimonythat coward wanted them to think you were crazy
of course it makes me mad it makes me more than mad just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him but what's it gonna do for me to find them now? i can't fix everything in three days
you've got to get yourself out of that place they're going to kill you if you don't
winning isn't everything
i might not be able to
me too
you're sure?
they're not here
they're not
what? what are you thinking?
i don't know maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream how can you have a street with no cars on it?
i don't know but this isn't a dream i'm real and so is where we are
then why isn't there anyone around?
of course he will [beat] what day of the week is it?
please don't tell me it's how you play the game
they've got lives to be grateful for
william you're not making sense
that's all you got from him? that bastard helped take your life away from you
no he didn't
if everything hadn't happened the way it has then i wouldn't be here right now sitting in a car with you touching your face
where are we going?
what's happening to me? why am i getting so much weaker?
lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there i need something to persuade her that i was there get me something to take to her
what?
when we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother? do you remember your address?
no after you
you gotta stop thinking like that
then where are you going?
i've been ok
good how's your mom?
[beat] you be good to yourself jackie
i think so
it's ok it's ok relax it's just a cut we can get it fixed but we need to get you to the hospital now how'd you get that?
how you doin'?
just a little when we were looking up information about william's father how did he help?
it's complicated but [looking at starks] in a way your father let me know how i'd get through to him
you don't trust me?
how?
he just saidthat i'd shock eugene and then things would change for him
i don't understand
because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups
and if i didn't want to come?
i guess i'd ask you why
because i don't think i'm crazy
you were convicted of the crime
that conviction doesn't convince me of anything until i know that i did it i'm not going to accept that i did
you may never remember at all [beat] your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged
i told mother i took care of you
why what would you do?
i could try tomake it stop
no i don't want it to
you should be careful you could be killed if they found you out here
my god you look exactly like him
i never knew my father did you?
yeah i did [beat] he was my most memorable patient
at the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things
what case?
how'd he get it?
you lied
[beat] i don't know
but dr morgan said you were around when my father was
well do you think dr becker would have any idea?
how do you know about dr becker?
so maybe dr becker would know [beat] but as i'm sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities
it's important for you to know who your father was isn't it?
exactly
well [beat] let me know how your search turns out
you'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition
what do you mean?
drat someone wants to implicate you in this affair mrs peel any idea who?
you have no idea what's going on
no i do that's what i'm saying to you
you don't understand
then help me understand you know you're not alone a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms what you have might well be a syndrome and if so it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously
i don't know [frustrated] remember?
come on tell me what you do know
[beat] i've seen a time that's not this time and i'm only able to see it when i'm in the jacket
well what time is it?
ok fine tell me about it tell me about the future 2004 what does it look like?
it doesn't look all that different
he had a videocamera?  where is she? quickly
no idea who no idea why 
the future doesn't look different?
no not for people like me [beat] not in the places i come from
what about the world?
[beat] like who? like mackenzie maybe?
why don't you help me?
because i don't have time
why not?
i'm about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that?
because of the future i know what's going to happen
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all children's things 
how do you know about eugene?
some part of you suspects  even if you don't know for sure  that what i'm saying is true
i don't know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
i know i know it all save your strength i already know everything you're going to say [beat] you're in the jacket right now aren't you?
howhow do you know?
you told me this was how it happened
i did?
whowho kills me?
you're going to be ok william we just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you
can i get some paper and something to write with
 or grownups who still like to be children
i'm not gonna let that happen
you still don't believe me do you?
i do believe you
william i can't indulge these delusions even when you're in this state
he's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does he has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly
who told you this?
i don't know when it'll happen but soon i think you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up
what are you talking about?
you know how to get there?
sure it's an easy address a little far out there but easy enough
quite any childhood friends? enemies?
that's kingsley old bastard hears us i'm sure he just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk i know i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue literally [beat] you're the cop killer right?
yeah guess so how'd you know?
i tried to kill my wife
don't you go to jail for that?
yeah well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy
what were you talking about the other day?
i wasn't talking about anything
i know you need one when it's really cold
[cutting in] mackenzie listen to me listen i'm going to die
mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with it means you're sane on some level
very well i have a friend who might be of assistance he's at the ministry we'd better be careful
[gravely] no i mean in four days i'm supposed to die
[beat] how do you know?
oh no you're pretty young your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think
it's gonna be sticky
'cause lorenson's got her claws in it now when she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me women
so what am i supposed to do?
geez how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
mackenzie [beat] what if we are crazy?
[shrugging] what if we are? there're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself [beat] everyone does it don't they? even becker that roller coaster car pops more pills than all of ward 3
becker does? are you sure?
his name's jones 'invisible' jones
you ever been to jail?
it's worse than war it's worse than anywhere you've ever been
hey mister you need a ride?
where are you going?
can you drive?
sure
if you're deaf read my lipsi don't need a psycho following me today
[beat] i'm not deaf
in case you hadn't figured it's christmas eve you're never gonna get a cab here
all right [beat] you got somewhere you need to go mister?
why's he called 'invisible'?
i'm not sure
i'm not sure
you don't have anywhere to stay?
well where are you from?
i'm not sure [beat] i don't really know
of course you don't know
why "of course"?
because in my life it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to it'd be too simple i probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that
well how'd you get here?
[beat] i was dropped off
aren't you coming?
no
well don't you somewhere? stuff? belongings?
great that was our last option what am i going to do with you?
nothing [getting up] thanks for bringing me this far
where are you going? you'll freeze out there you don't even have a coat
i'll manage
no you won't you'll die of cold out there and then i'll have to feel guilty and i've already got more guilt than i know what to do with [beat] do you want something to drink?
[beat] yeah i'm fine
what's this?
i only lit it because it was so cold in here i'm sorry if
we must hurry mrs peel 
you want a drink?
this is pretty good considering
so you're a waitress right? i meanfrom the uniform you were wearing
yup that's me
you like it?
[beat] i do it
[beat] why'd you stop?
shit happens and your life changes 'bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen [beat] so how come you don't know where you're coming from?
well good for you
[beat] why?
hurry?  what for?  i'm just now 
you don't think that's crazy?
this is a great song
but hey who can forget those words? the man just wants simple and good things for his woman  that she be warm and happy how hard can that be to remember?
they told me i joined the army when i was seventeen that's when my father died and before that it was apparently just me and him since i was born 'cause my mom split
so you never knew your mother?
i guess not but as of now i never knew either
i'm sorry
yeah [beat] how about you?
never knew my father i grew up with my mother actually i grew up around my mother she was great though i mean the way she was with her friends she was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us [beat] she died young
how?
hey that's great you guys got it all wrapped up but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  it gives us somethin' to do
there's a reception this evening colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend
i'm sorry
yeah me too [softly] every day for the last ten years
damnit thelma don't holler like that  haven't i told you i can't stand it when you holler in the morning
hon
what
have a good day at work today
uhhuh
hon?
what?
you want anything special for dinner?
what's that you're wearing?
no thelma i don't give a shit what we have for dinner  i may not even make it home for dinner  you know how fridays are
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night  you'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend
'bye honey  i won't wait up
 only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night
darryl
what?
honey?
yes baby?
do you think you could ever shoot someone?
what?
it's called black leather
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
i could shoot your cousin eddie
why?
because he's an inconsiderate asshole
i'm asking you seriously sarah a stranger?
i don't know honey  i guess it would depend
on what?
well maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids  i'm sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children
yeah i could too  but i don't know why i'm even asking you this it's just we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie i don't know  i keep hearing words  impossible  inconceivable  if just one person would say
honey  nothing's impossible  you just don't shoot someone like that for no reason  maybe he was askin' for it  anyway somebody's husband probably got ol' harlan
what is it?
that's what everybody says  only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night could you shoot eddie in the face?  at point blank range?
in the leg
who's the nut?
that's thelma dickinson's husband
alright  she did good  didn't she?
we spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a miss louise sawyer  do you know her too?
umm yes  she was driving
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city  he also says that at that time he met a man  he identified you through a series of mug shots  he also told us that you and mrs dickinson seemed "close" is that true?
did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the law?
now that you mention it they might have been a little bit jumpy
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaw's
how do you know i took it?  how do you know they didn't just give it to me?
could you identify 'em if ya saw 'em again?
hal i've told you about twenty times yes i could identify 'em but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this
well you're not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure?
if waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature then nothin' will and i could've told you that harlan puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot i'm just surprised it didn't happen before now
who do you think did it?
has anybody asked his wife?  she's the one i hope did it
lena just cut the bullshit will ya?  do have any ideas or don't ya? i been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night and i still got to go file a report before i can go home in time to get back up again
well if i had to guess i'd say it was some ol' gal some ol' gal's husband  but it wasn't either one of those two  the tall one the redhead she left me a huge tip
you didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
it's a nightclub not a drivein hal  i don't follow the customers to the parking lot
i've been better
you girls are in some hot water
we're both fine
good  you wanna tell me what happened?
hey
how are things goin' out there?
weird  got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'
you're still with us though  you're somewhere on the face of the earth?
you're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone
you first
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident?
no
you know certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind things like incarceration cavity search life imprisonment death by electrocution that sort of thing so come out alive?  i don't know let us think about that
all we know is there were two women in a green tbird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot going real fast  we're trying to get a make on the car but nothin' yet  so far we got nothin'
well you'd best get something even if they didn't do it it times out that they most likely witnessed it  i want somebody to at least talk to 'em  put out an apb with a description and see what we get back
alright
is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
that's certainly possible
why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this
i have no problem with that
trubshaw again? what now?
i swear to god she wouldn't tell me one thing  christ  you oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em
tell us about him
this is serious son  a man is dead
is this the guy you saw them with?
armed robber
what kind of gun was it?
a 38
we're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in  someone will be here until we find them
good god
now for one thing you violated your parole two days out  and you know judge hainey  he hates this sort of thing  once he gets wind of this he's gonna blow sky high  and then when he finds out that you're a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery well i think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight don't you?
they're playing your song mrs peel
it's just not working like this  we gotta do something  it'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals but jesus hal this is makin' us look bad  i don't know maybe they're not movin'  maybe that little creep lied
he's got nothin' to gain by lyin'  nothin' at all  he already got all their money  i just don't know what we're dealin' with here anyway it went out again last night on nationwide teletype  let's just wait it out a little longer  she said she was gonna call back  let's just sit tight
we don't have a whole lotta choice do we?  i can't figure out if they're real smart or just really really lucky
hey  don't let them shoot those girls  this is too much  they got guns pointed at 'em
i'm sorry to bother you i know you're real busy right now but how many times max?  how many times has that woman gotta be fucked over? you could lift one finger and save her ass and you won't even do that?

whose place is this again?
it's bob's the day manager's  he's gettin' a divorce so his wife's gettin' this place so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys
a fine night mrs peel 
i've never had the chance to go out of town without darryl
how come he let you go?
'cause i didn't ask him
aw shit thelma he's gonna kill you
how much longer is it gonna be?  i'm hungry
another hour of so  we've got enough food for a month
i'll never make it can't we stop just for a few minutes
we've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is thelma
i haven't seen a place like this since i left texas
thelma
still a bit chilly 
tell me somethin'  is this my vacation or isn't it?  i mean god you're as bad as darryl
i just haven't seen you like this in a while  i'm used to seeing you more sedate
alright  i changed my mind  i'll have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side please
jeez louise that wasn't very nice
can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
so what if he was?  it's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded that's all
maybe
so jimmy still hasn't called yet?
givin' him a taste of his own medicine  asshole
i'm sorry louise  i know you're all upset  it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house i guess  i wonder if darryl's home yet
english weather you know after all we've been through i should say we deserve a long holiday 
i wonder if jimmy's gotten back
why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
exactly
thelma i'm gonna hit the little girls' room and then we gotta hit the road
oh my god
get the car
jesus christ  louise you shot him
shit  i i which way?
louise  where are we going?
shouldn't we go to the cops?  i mean i think we should tell the police
have you any place in mind?
tell them what?  what thelma? what do you think we should tell them?
i don't know  just tell 'em what happened
which part?
all of it  that he tried to rape me
we gotta be inconspicuous  do you know what that means?
yes
we have to think this through  we have to be smart  now is not the time to panic  if we panic now we're done for  nobody saw it nobody knows it was us  we're still okay  now all we have to do is just figure out our next move
our next move?  i'll say one thing louise  this is some vacation  i sure am having a good time  this is real fun
if you weren't so concerned with having a good time we wouldn't be here right now
just what is that supposed to mean?
i don't recall siberia being this warm steed
it means shut up thelma
we're gonna go to the next town and stop  we'll get a motel room  i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money  we're gonna need money  thelma  how much money do you have with you?
i'm cash poor
oh i don't know  i'm just nervous i gotta figure out what to do
well when you figure it out wake me up
what do you mean?
why are you actin' like this?
you could help me try and figure it out  i gotta figure out what to do and you could try and help me
i suggested we go to the police but you didn't like that; so frankly louise i'm all out of ideas
well what's the big rush thelma? if we just give 'em some time they'll come to us  oh christ i'm just not ready to go to jail yet  why don't you go out to the pool or something and i'll figure it out
it's the latest thing mrs peel
give me the keys
you're not touchin' that car
my stuff's in the trunk  god  you care more about that car than you do about most people
did you finish thinking?
don't get mad louise but where are we going?
oklahoma city  jimmy's gonna wire me some money and then
you talked to him?  is he mad?  did you tell him?
no i didn't tell him  and that's something we gotta get straight darryl's been callin' mad as a hornet makin' all kinds of noise when you talk to him you cannot say anything about this  you gotta make sure everything sounds normal
i called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home  i don't know what he's got to be mad about  i'm the one who should be mad
i've been tellin' you that for the last ten years
our little paradise  just made for two?
do you think darryl's having an affair?
i don't think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair
but you think he fools around
thelma i'm going to mexico  i think i can make it in two and a half days but i'm going to have to haul ass  are you up to this?  i mean i have to know  this isn't a game  i'm in deep shit  i gotta know what you're gonna do
i i don't know  i don't know what you're askin' me
call him?
call him  don't tell him anything tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night
will i be?
louise this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride and i thought since
it's probably not a good idea
our chaperon
i wish we could've brought him with us
what did darryl say?
i just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride  did you see his butt?  darryl doesn't have a cute butt  you could park a car in the shadow of his ass
i'm sorry  i'm just not in the mood for company right now  here  take this map  i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city  i think we should stay off the interstates  we're too conspicuous
well it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas then cut over to
i don't want to go that way  find a way that we don't have to go through texas
wait  what?  you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you don't want to go through texas?
you know how i feel about texas we're not going that way
i know louise but we're running for our lives  don't you think you could make an exception just this once?  i mean look at the map the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas
thelma  i'm not gonna talk about this  now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will  you understand?
ah  sun tan lotion any shops nearby?
he's got a lot to be proud of
louise and darryl don't get along
that's puttin' it mildly
she thinks he's a pig
yup  that's him goin'  i love to watch him go
i don't care what you say about him the boy has got it bad
he's always got it bad as long as i'm running in the other direction don't be fooled he's no different than any other guy  he knows how to chase and that's it  once he's caught you he don't know what to do  so he runs away
so what are you gonna tell him?
nothing  i'm not gonna tell him a thing  the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is
i didn't ask him to come  it's like i said thelma he just loves the chase
it's your crime scene now  you can do what you want
your mission is simple find out how and why these agents died
well boy he's got his work cut out for him now don't he?
put a lid on it thelma  it's hard enough as it is  just let me get this part over with  now stay here and guard the money  if there's any problem i'm in room 115
how do i look?
you're a vision louise a goddamn vision of loveliness you always are
what happened to your hair?
what's wrong with you?
nothing  why?  do i seem different?
yes now that you mention it  you seem crazy  like you're on drugs
well i'm not on drugs  but i might be crazy
oh thelma  oh no
think of it as special assignment mrs peel with a twist you're our chief suspect
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about   this is just a whole 'nother ball game
thelma please get a hold of yourself  you're making a spectacle
you know louise you're supposed to be my best friend  you could at least be a little bit happy for me you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting
i'm sorry  i am happy  i'm very happy for you  i'm glad you had a good time  it's about time  where is he now?
taking a shower
eightyeight dollars ain't gonna make a dent baby girl
don't worry about it  you want anything?
drive  drive away
i'm sorry  well we need the money now we have it
oh shit thelma  shit  shit shit
where's mother?
now you get a grip louise  just drive us to goddamn mexico will ya
okay  shit thelma  what'd you do? i mean what did you say?
holy shit
for the first time in my life i wish this car wasn't green
are you sure we should be driving like this?  in broad daylight and everything?
no we shouldn't but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime
oooooweee  you shoulda seen me like i'd been doin' it all my life nobody would ever believe it
you think you've found your calling?
you're disturbed
so what's the plan thelma?  you just gonna stay drunk?
you don't believe him?
try to
ugh  why do they have to do that?
thelma
yeah
i want you to call darryl
what for?
to find out if he knows anything if you think he does you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped
jeez louise tapped the phone?  you think so?
oh come on  murder one and armed robbery thelma
murder one  god louise can't we even say it was selfdefense?
emma in wonderland welcome mrs peel  we've been expecting you we hope you'll enjoy your stay with us decontamination is almost complete
but it wasn't  we got away  we were walkin' away
they don't know that  it was just you and me there  i'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him  i mean it's almost the truth
it won't work
why not?
besides what do we say about the robbery?  no excuse for that  no such thing as justifiable robbery
fill her up  there's a phone right over there
that jd kid is a little shit
how'd they find out we're going to mexico thelma how they know that?
i i
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up  i asked him not to tell  i didn't think he would tell anybody
decontamination  ?
just stop talkin' to people thelma stop bein' so open  we're fugitives now  let's behave that way
louise?  where are we?
just past boise city
idaho?
oklahoma thelma  we're crossing into new mexico
now what?
now what what?
whaddo we do?
oh i don't know thelma  i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays  maybe we could have children with the prison guards
can i ask you kind of a weird question?
talk to the pipe mrs peel that usually helps don't worry about me being invisible other than that i'm perfectly normal
yeah
of all the things in the world that scare you what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
you mean now or before?
before
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs
what little dogs?
you know those little dogs you see people with?
like a chihuahua?
those too but you know those little hairy ones?  those flatfaced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
oh yeah  you mean peekapoos
i see
yeah  those  that always put the fear of god in me  what about you?
well to be honest the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin' to get to me
i can see that
i mean look how different he looks just since high school  it's bad enough i have to get old but doin' it with darryl around is only gonna make it worse  i mean i don't think he's gonna be very nice about it
well now maybe you won't have to
this is so beautiful
gosh  it sure is
i always wanted to travel  i just never got the opportunity
look  look who it is thelma  i'll be darned  what's he doin' way out here
oh christ  i hate this guy
ah here we are steed asked me to play a hunch:  valentine peel
what?
nothing  it's not funny

just the look on his face when you   it's not funny
boy he wasn't expectin' that
thelma
i don't want to talk about it thelma i'm not kidding  don't you even
i'm warning you thelma  you better drop it right now  i don't want to talk about it
peter's brother?  but

i don't know  shit  let's just play it by ear  he may not know he may just give me a ticket
i told you to slow down  hell officer i told her to slow down
i am really sorry about this

louise are we still going to mexico?
watch the news?
now let's see  eton cambridge  research into robotics and plastics overtaken by peter's work on the physics of climate change 
well i figure if you take a state policeman shoot up his car take his gun and lock him in the trunk it's best to just get on out of the state if you can
i don't want to see any more beef jerky  i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window it's drivin' me crazy  the whole car smells like it
it's good  it's what the pioneers ate
and i don't want any more wild turkey either  it's burning a hole in my stomach
okay okay i've got some tequila you want some tequila?
you do?
yeah you want it?
shit  i'm gettin' tired
i think i've really fucked up  i think i've got us in a situation where we could both get killed  why didn't we just go straight to the police
you know why  you already said
i know all this
what'd i say again?
nobody would believe us  we'd still get in trouble  we'd still have our lives ruined  and you know what else?
what?
that guy was hurtin' me  and if you hadn't come out when you did he'd a hurt me a lot worse  and probably nothin' woulda happened to him 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night  and they woulda made out like i asked for it  and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now  at least now i'm havin' fun  and i'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead i'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me  and if i haven't i wanna take this time to thank you louise  thank you for savin' my ass
i said all that?
no louise you said the first part i said all the rest
louise?
yes thelma?
you're not gonna give up on me are ya?
what do you mean?
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother inlaw was under surveillance?
you're not gonna make some deal with that guy are you?  i mean i just wanna know
no thelma  i'm not gonna make any deals
thelma that is not an option
but i don't know something's crossed over in me and i can't go back  i mean i just couldn't live
he said they're charging us with murder
eeuww
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive
louise do you think we should change cars get another car?
sure you know how to hotwire a car?
no
surveillance? by whom?
you awake?
you could call it that  my eyes are open
me too  i feel awake
good
we'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea mamasita
we can change our names
we can live in a hacienda
i wanna get a job  i wanna work at club med
yes  yes  now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
it'd have to be pretty good
father she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr darling
we should head a little further in there's not that many roads in this state  i want to try to hit mexico somewhere not so close to new mexico  they probably wanna kill us in new mexico

let me guess:  wonderland weather
it must be great with a wife like that
each day is better than the next  have you ever been you know in love with someone?
nah

mary again
look i admit it was brief but it was definitely love crushes don't last twelve years
whatever happened to mary?
i told you her family moved to miami
i mean since then
i don't know
very good mrs peel 
well why don't you look her up?
yeah right
why not?
because i guarantee she's married and has a couple kids girls like mary don't stay single
what if you're wrong? you just said she's the only girl you ever loved what have you got to lose by calling her?
i did try calling her  a few years ago she wasn't listed
so that was it? one bump in the road and you gave up?
i also called unsolved mysteries
you're kidding? what did they say?
they told me they don't help out stalkers  look maybe they're right it's been a long time
i shall need a small plane
i don't know about this dom
relax this guy owes me a big one a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume  like we haven't all done that anyway they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tearjerker letter that ended up on my desk
his mother?
yeah i guess he still lives with her seemed like a sweet lady  got diabetes or something  so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence
and you think he could find out her number for me?
that's it i'm making an oath i'll never procrastinate about anything again life is too fucking short
hey look on the bright side 
what's that dom? what's the bright side?
well at least now you know
what's so funny?
you're not venturing alone surely
wait a second i never told you that
maybe you're right i should look on the bright side i mean i've still got my health  i'm out of here i've got to get up at six am to move my boss's brother into his apartment
what? on your day off? do you even know the guy?
never met him
jesus ted you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine
mary's a babe
what?
my mary  she's not in japan she's single and she's got no rugrats she does have a little gambling problem she plays the football cards a bit too much but she's a babe a surgeon babe
huh? but why did healy?
no you mean?
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns 
uhhuh
the lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up
well then you've got to call her man
you are one lucky sonofabitch you know that?
i am?
didn't they tell you? that hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak you got a fucking horseshoe up your ass man

we know one thing that suspect was not mrs peel
okay sounds like you're all set just clean the pipes and it's a go
hm?
you know clean the pipes
pipes? what are you talking about?
think about it: after you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed are you nervous?
why's that?
wrong it's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more that'll fuck with your head that stuff will
huh
the most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load that's a medical fact and it's because you're no longer trying to get laid you're actually thinking like a girl they love that
jesus christ you're right
unsolved mystery  she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
joey never told you we went out did he?

hey love will make you do fuckedup things

no i mean
 there's this one kid we call him mongo on account of he's a mongoloid he got out of his cage once and 
 he's in a cage?
well it's more of an enclosure really
they keep him confined? that's bullshit
your research into climate engineering was stateoftheart your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming  had they succeeded we need your expertise
that's what i said so i went out and got him a leash you know one of those clothesline runners for the backyard he's got plenty of room out there to dig the kid's really blossomed now i can take him to ball games movies  you know happy stuff

all you want is a phone number?
well i know you're busy
don't play games with me ted
i don't know maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a labrador
i don't buy it
ted i'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip now i want you to level with me: did you knock this skirt up?
who knows? if dr darling is right you should watch out
no
she's blackmailing you right?
no
you want her dead don't you?
you can't be serious
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
i'm not a stalker she's a friend of mine
sure she is that's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years oh you're good ted you're a real piece of work
look let's forget it let's forget the whole thing
i get one hundred a day plus expenses
why?
i've got some very very good news for you my friend
i think your life's about to change
so you found mary?
right there in liberty city and you were right she's really something
so she hasn't changed?
that i couldn't say let me ask you something: was she a little bigboned in high school?
no not at all
mary's a little chubby huh?
but you know you shit out a bunch of kids you're going to put on a few pounds
so she's married?
something went wrong system malfunction explosion mrs peel had a narrow escape suspected sabotage nothing proven file still open
nope never been
huh?
four kids three different guys
three different guys?
well i'm guessing there's a black kid two whites and a midget
oh my
hyperactive little fuckers too tough to keep up with in a wheelchair i bet
don't look so shocked it's been a long time i bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years haven't you?
it's just that mary i wouldn't have thought
thanks healy good work
still doesn't better safe than sorry  she was in a dangerous game steed high stakes she may prove to be a risk  if she is there's only one solution  termination
ted? don't you want the name of the housing project?
uh that's okay
what are you doing?
miami?
yeah this insurance business is too slow for me i'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai
jai alai?
look uh i've been thinking about everything you told me
good good
well i think you're right i should look her up
rollerpig? are you nuts?
anyone particular in mind?
but you said she was a sparkplug?
all the same i still want to call her i know it sounds crazy  mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life  but i don't know maybe i can help her out  the poor thing's had it tough  she's in a wheelchair for godsakes
it's a goddamn bunion it'll heal
okay tell you what: i'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from japan
japan? what's she doing in japan?
mary's a mailorder bride?
hey hey hey
you fucked me man? why would you do that?
what do you mean 'why'?
look you asked me to follow your girl around and i did and i started to like her and then i realized i just couldn't in good conscience do it
nah why should you?
we had a lead to wonderland weather but we got there too late someone tipped them off 
do what?
turn her over to a stalker
what? you're calling me a stalker?
oh christ poor dog
you're a sick man you know that?
yeah well fuck you you just can't stand the fact that it was my turn
your turn?
well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water jesus christ just because she found out about you why'd you have to take me down with you?
i don't know what you're talking about
i'm talking about the letter asshole
too late anyway today's escapade was only for starters this is no ordinary weather it's manmade a kind of weather bomb
are you telling me you didn't send mary a letter outlining our deal?
pleasure to meet you patrick
mainly i work out of boston
boston huh? did you get your degree up there?
yes yes i did get my degree up there
harvard?
you bet
did you study under kim greene?
among others
kim and i are close friends
this man  did you see him?
well i'll tell her i ran into you
really? but he's been married for twenty years  they've got six kids
have you been to  let's see  santiago chile?
absolutely i was there twice last year which building is yours?
do you know the soccer stadium?
did you build the estadio olympico?
no just down the street the amigo tower
i'm sorry i'm not familiar with it what style?
you know i really should take your card
okay pat take it easy  don't do anything stupid
you're accusing mrs peel of killing her own husband?
whoa whoa  i don't know what you're talking about
that stalker ted got to you right? you're working for him aren't you you little shit?
you what?
i'm a phony  just like you man
what do you mean?
i mean i'm a fucking fraud i'm no architect don't be a putz  who's been to santiago twice in a year?  estadio olimpico  please
but but you knew people at harvard
i knew shit the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else  my real name's norm i deliver pizzas
so then in '94 i went back to dade community college for a semester and when the walmart cashier job fell through i hooked up with the pizza barn
and you met mary how?
pity i was growing fond of mrs peel unfortunately 
just dumb luck i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown  that was it for me i went home that night shaved my beard and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back
how'd you manage that one?
friend baseball bat
nice
oh yeah the plan was going along just fine until you showed up
hey hey hey i'm not the one who started telling baldfaced lies about the competition  that's crossing the line
what line? the day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war
future wife? get real man  you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes
that stalkin' sonofabitch
how many is that?
guilty until proven innocent?
four
that seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch  you sure it won't kill him?
holy shit
hey this is a pretty nice place
you little fuck
what?
i swear i didn't tell her nothing you probably did it yourself you piece of shit
oh that makes a lot of sense why would i rat myself out?
like i'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
you were following us?
i was hoping you could tell me
oh sully
thanks for picking me up
no prob i could use the company i've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight
i know how you feel  i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours you know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state
that must make it tough
sucks so what's up? you some kind of salesman or something?
nah i'm i'm nothing
oh well i am
hm?
a salesman  that's what i am i mean i'm gonna be anyway i'm starting my own company  video sales  just as soon as i get enough seed money
you're getting yourself into terrible trouble my son weather's turning very nasty  and so am i
'that right? good for you
yeah you wouldn't believe my idea  it's a home run you ever hear of eightminute abs?
the exercise tape? sure i've seen it on tv
i see where you're going
think about it you walk into a video store and you see eightminute abs and right next to it you see seven minute abs  which one you gonna spring for?
i'd go with the seven
bingo especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work out
how do you guarantee that?
well it's the company motto: 'if you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute'
no it should be 'a hockey player with great pecs'
i'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own if i'm right mrs peel is innocent and you have a mole
i can live with those reflections
i'm sick of these caloriecountin' pansies give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty six holes and still has enough energy to take me and warren out to a ballgame
jeez i don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that
yeah and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to katmandu
what's that supposed to mean?
it means you're too hard on guys
no i'm not
yeah steve steve was all right for awhile
i don't know it was complicated he's in san francisco i'm in miami  besides magda's psychic dog hated him
is that old crab still with you? mary you said you were putting her up for a month  it's been a year and a half
where?
what? steve seemed to put up with warren
have you been up all night again?
bet your ass i have it's an important job neighborhood watch is
neighborhood watch? is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
these ain't strangers they're neighbors this only picks up signals in a halfmile radius
meaning?
meaning these are the people you live amongst you got a right to know if they're creeps for instance did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
you picked that up on the scanner we gotta move
magda puffy barks at everybody
that's because there's a lot of bad people out there hey puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing  he was a fucking asswipe  but you had to find out for yourself didn't you?
i don't even watch tv
in your operation
jesus mary you gotta hear this  some cop's staking out this broad's apartment
so who's the lucky guy?
name's patrick i met him at the driving range
good lookin'?
what's he like?
i don't know he's kind of a mook
what's a mook?
you know a mookalone a schlep
then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
come on magda  it's like that movie harold and maude
are you alright young man?
i don't watch the new ones
this one's almost thirty years old it's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love
the point is love isn't about money or social standing or age it's about connecting with someone having things in common kindred spirits
sure  uh magda why don't you get some more cheese and crackers?
bundt cake?
hey hey what did you say pat's last name was?
i'm buying bananas tonight
why?
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex i think you're gonna need one tonight
don't bet on it last time i had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker
cocky little bastard i hope he was a baddy
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies
knock it off pollyanna just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be
love? come on i wouldn't call it love
an old flame?
you vicious bitch how do you sleep at night?
holy shit
magda
oh hi hon just straightening up
where's puffy?
pat's an architect too
i feel sure of it
pat does projects all over the world
what's up doc?
you don't think they're too big?
he's a nice guy isn't he?
not long at all but i really like him  okay i know he's a little different tucker but that's what i like about him he's a guy a real guy he dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts too and that's okay with me
that's what you've been looking for  a farter?
i've been looking for a guy  not one of these south beach pussies
i thought so anyway i hope you don't think i'm being meddlesome i just think you should be careful with this guy
no no no tucker thank you
i mean let's face it mary you're beautiful you've got money you trust people  i'm just saying there's a lot of psychos out there
i'm alice mother said you'd be on your way mrs peel with you?
can i pour you one?
what's up?
i think you'd better sit down
tucker i appreciate you doing all this but i'm really strapped for time here and 
what?
i can't believe this is happening i'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour
magda's right i'm so lucky to have you in my life
don't get all gooey on me now you'll give me a big head  the important thing doctor is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off
uh well not exactly you see i exaggerated a little there
name's norm i live up in pompano with my folks
you with mother or father?
oh yeah fine
hey you're limping did you just hurt yourself?

which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do mr president we're tracking 26 ships inbound to cuba there's no sign they're changing course the closest ships the gagarin and the kimovsk will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow
we've been hailing the groznyy for the last hour mr secretary the groznyy refuses to stop
what are you doing?
carrying out our mission mr secretary if you don't mind we're very busy right now we need to be able to do our jobs
i was at harrow 
yes captain you may proceed clear your guns
starshells
i believe the president made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission
with all due respect mr secretary we were not firing on the ship firing on a ship means attacking the ship we were not attacking the ship we were firing over it
this was not the president's intention when he gave that order what if the soviets don't see the distention? what if they make the same mistake i just did?  there will be no firing anything near any soviet ships without my express permission is that understood admiral?
yes sir
this private assurance represents the word of the highest authority?
yes
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
with the caveat that it is not made public in any way shape or form  and we must have an answer tomorrow at the latest i cannot stress this point enough
bangbang  you're dead
tomorrow
good
jesus christ guys what the hell's khruschev thinking?
did you have any indication of this from georgi? any possible warning or sense of motivation?
he's right jack taylor is saying we may have some time we've got to use it
so if there are alternatives that make sense  and i'm not saying there are  we need 'em need 'em fast
what about the allies? congress? i think we may need to start letting key people know and they're all scattered across the country for the campaign we're going to need to get the un staff in and warmed up jesus i don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours
as if dealing with the russians wasn't hard enough we gotta worry about our own house
there's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product
lying bastard lied to my face
sure  but i would like to ask you something  you got a problem with me?
one shot  for emergencies
we're split down the middle if i held a vote i think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two
i want a consensus bobby consensus either air strike or blockade something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it i need it by saturday make it happen
well i'm not
goddamn stevenson jesus peace at any price you'd think nobody learned anything from world war two
somebody had to say it i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser
we have to pull him he's not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the un zorin will eat him alive
we're going to have to stop a ship eventually show the quarantine's got teeth or we'll prove mccone right
he gets it but he's pissed
we were just debating who had it worse us or george washington and his guys
he didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons
that's not playing by the rules
how does a guy get a rep like that?
who gives a shit about the midterms now? the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us
the other thing is
i know cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs
they're going to be pressing for a military solution soon we can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here
i'll do it
it's too politicized with you in there anyway they need to be able to stick their necks out
jack i'm as conniving as they come but a sneak attack is just wrong
what happened to speak when spoken to?
jesus
rules are made to be broken
rescind the order can all the chiefs put nitze gilpatric and the undersecretaries in charge
adlai's too weak we have to convince jack to pull him get mccloy in there
you can't take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble
oh still sore about this
my father 
adlai can handle zorin he knows the inning and the score
where've you been? we've been trying to find you all morning
helen and i went out for breakfast excom's not supposed to convene til eight
if you say so
we're getting everyone together as fast as we can
what does the letter say?
and?
and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey
the jupiters are obsolete they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway 
all right so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look okay? you happy? so now what?
so now you've got to talk him out of it and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution
we gave so much to get here i don't know sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for?
slow down smell that?
smoke
you said  one shot
yeah?
hey mac you're up bright and early
what's it about?
helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families
what did you think of lippman's column this morning?
you gotta stop 'em we know it's jack and bobby's idea  they leaked it to lippman the military guys are going ape and they're not alone
then they should speak up
christ ken you know it's not that easy
yes it is
jack and bobby are good men but it takes a certain character moral toughness to stand up to 
aren't you forgetting about something?
 you listen to me nobody nobody talks about my friends that way you're fucking here right now because of the kennedys they may be wrong they make mistakes but they're not weak the weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds
the sun came up today
yeah
every day the sun comes up says something about us
i am instructed to tell you that the american government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed if this solution were raised at the un by ambassador zorin he would find a favorable reply from ambassador stevenson
so i understand you correctly if the missiles in cuba were dismantled returned to the soviet union and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade cuba?
that is correct
this is from the highest authority?
yes from the highest authority there are two conditions the un must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles
and the second condition?
you are and it's behind you
john how much time?
max
we have high confidence in the expanded air strike option  the problem mr president is that it's a shortterm solution khruschev can send more missiles next month the chiefs and i believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of oplan 316
an invasion
is this the chiefs' recommendation?
how long until the army is ready?
guess we can't blame khruschev for a few patriotic farmers and the ships?
still heading for cuba
 i have the authority i am the commanderinchief of the united states and i say when we go to war
we are not at war sir not until we're at defcon 1
i think she really likes you  where's mrs peel?
so which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? how do we work with them if there's been a hardline coup?
then we have no choice  general issue the warning orders to our forces they will be prepared to execute the air strikes monday morning and the followon invasion according to the schedule thereafter i'll need the official release orders on my desk sunday night
does this attack on our plane represent a definitive intentional escalation on the part of the soviets?
don't forget mrs higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about kevin you need to do something about this
when are you going to be home?
i don't know helen i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow leave the tv on sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off
what's happened?
nothing nothing you don't know about tomorrow's the big day just have the car ready to go if i call or if the civil defense warning comes on
what happens to you? i'm not leaving without you
if you're home it means either jack and bobby have finally figured out what a con man you are and fired you or 
what's happening?
 we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president i think we've won
i saw you out there you want him to call you back need you
how's my favorite president?
busy but you've got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections? you need me
well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
pretending there isn't a problem won't fix it he can clear the air on anglo american relations
forget it scotty
debbie's marrying rick
it's tuesday you said to call when do i get my 45 minutes?
tell you what we're in connecticut tomorrow for ribicoff i'll get you up front with him during the flight
kenny what happened? they didn't let me up front said the president was on the phone the whole time
he was
yeah? who was he talking to? acheson? come on o'donnell everyone's wondering what's going on what's acheson doing in town? and don't give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks acheson's mr cold war
why don't you ask him yourself? you can have him on the way home
there are major rail disruptions in the south two airborne divisions are on alert that exercise is an invasion
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
secretary of defense
dean rusk
if you found me steppin' on your crime scene  it might piss you off too  what about the report?
does cole know about this?
hey sport you winning?
i guess you won't be coming home tonight
get back out there kid remember to hit 'em hard
what about you? where are you going?
i was eating that
no you weren't
so what've we got today?
still think cuba isn't important?
should be here any minute
no choice this is going to cost lives any way we go do nothing and it could be 80 million of ours we have to get rid of those missiles
i'm totally blown away you're getting married it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex
okay kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into impress us and do it fast  you're in charge of keeping this quiet if word gets out before we know what we're going to do there'll be panic and it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them
call me irish but i don't believe in cooler heads prevailing
acheson's scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone
let's get out of here
have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
you don't show for chicago everyone'll know there's something going on
i don't care cancel it
i'm not calling and canceling on daly you call and cancel on daly
you're scared to cancel on daly
we have to try the blockades it probably won't work it may just be delaying the inevitable but we can't just go to war without trying not to
look at that guy what a hunk
you'd worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support
i don't like what's happening
in the morning i'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room mcnamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon keep an eye on things there
all right 'cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships shots being fired across bows
i know i know
what about these lowlevel flights? they're starting in what? an hour? do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
we need those flights we have to know when those missiles become operational because when they do we need to destroy them
i'm your political advisor and i'm giving you political analysis here this is a setup the chiefs want to go in it's the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs they have to go in and they have to do it right it's that simple
how does a man get to a place where he can say 'throw those lives away' so easily?
that's going to be tough you know how these guys are about their chains of command
debbie i don't believe it i'm so excited
we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships but it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles
he's right we can't rescind defcon 2 the soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them
what's that?
i don't want to listen to this again
if we made a trade we'd be giving in to extortion and nato would never trust us again we'll get clobbered in world opinion
it's a goddman trial balloon trial is the operative word here
jesus christ o'donnell you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution
didn't know adlai had it in him too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52
hello?
i've got to move what do you have kenny?
bobbie what are you talking about?
they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
you're sure
don't take it to court but we've got good circumstantial evidence  walter agrees my gut's telling me khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message
we give them something we tell them we'll remove the missiles from turkey say six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage we also tell them if they go public about it we deny it and the deal is off
moving the line stroke of genius
you must think i'm blind and stupid i've already gotten the birds and bees from bobby the president doesn't have to doublebarrel me
listen to me goddamn it we're talking about a possible nuclear war you dropped the ball on bay of pigs 
 you sonofabitch goddamn it i didn't drop 
at least it will expose whether khruschev has been overthrown we'll know what we're dealing with
dangle a settlement tie us down in negotiations we come up short
he still thinks i'm going with him i'm going to break the news to him tomorrow
why else would they approach us in this way? it's deniable the soviets have done nothing but lie to us this could be more of the same
that may be why khruschev's introducing this guy we've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels so he brings in an honest broker
my specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not khruschev last night's letter was  the evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup and khruschev was replaced overnight
it's transparent the press'll be all over it
bob bet you had a late night
bob?
bob is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
captain force the sub to the surface for inspection
mr president we're receiving reports that the ships are stopping
captain belay that order  bob where's that coming from
he's not gonna be happy and your parents can't be too thrilled either
just a second mr president
hey
hey nice tie
yeah
you're my hero carl
heroes ain't supposed to shake i'm shakin' man look at me
anyone stops us going in we're with the bowenhamilton textile company we have rug samples

easy cowboy no vendettas on my ship now: remember what i told you about nam? watch the grass watch the trees watch the shit house be on your toes and if we get committed don't hesitate to empty that sucker

the owl told him about leo that's incredible i guess we just broke the back of this investigation didn't we? evidence doesn't get any harder than that  not for my money is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court?
he also said "listen to the water"
listen to the water listen to the owl he also said don't trust the fucking cookie monster

jimmy didn't do it ray i checked it out you can stop taggin' my sister

well it is it is that too
that's a big comfort to me
i could be too
how so?
save you from a big mistake with that other guy
five thousand dollars
yeah most likely
was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
can i walk you out?she turns back to him a smile
i thought he'd never leave
everybody's got to be somewhere
what if captain dawson had come with me?
it would have been really embarrassing
how did you know this was my car?
simple deduction it's fast it's pretty sleek and stylishit's your colormatches your lipstick
that's all
seventyfive hundred
i beg your pardon
no i beg yours but i don't think you're right on that
why not?
i saw one
you saw a mig 21?
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive
where did you see that?
it's what?
lieutenant i have a top secret clearance the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you
not in this case charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g?
not interested
yes ma'am
where were you?
he was in a 4g negative dive and you were on his six?
if you were directly above him how did you see him?
two
two miles
the what?
it never came up
you let me make a fool of myself
you seemed determined to do that anyway why didn't you tell me you were a famous mig insulter? maverick would it have made a difference?
what?
maybe you don't care about that either  prettiest suspect i've had in awhile
okay ten thousand plus a ge toaster oven a litton microwave a cuisinart
no
what would?
what would you say too fasttoo quick
and far too aggressive
well what you needwhat you have to keep looking forwhat you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you who can match you move for move then you've got something  i'm sorry
for what?
that stuff about the mig i was out of line
apology acknowledged
is that all? charlie what else do you want?
um you
i'm marrying debbie
there you go with those moves again
too aggressive?
i don't mix with the boys i work here let's keep it professional
i'm special
yes i'll give you that
i can't
i thought there was something that night in the club
lieutenant
evan or maverick
maverickyou know the rules of engagement
michelin tires brand new a set of sears best metric tools
the what?
some one comes up hot on your six what do you do?
what are you talking about?
you turn into him check him out identify friend or foe
i'm not your foe charlie and if he's harmless you disengage
harmless
uh hum
what if he's not?
and probably never again it's nothing personal it's justi know a lot of pilots maybe i'm immune
don't worry i'm a new strain and i don't give up everything i've ever wanted i've had to work like hell for well how about it?
thanks dad  cole go away
how about what?
how about anything anything you want to do
hard to argue with that isn't it
a date coffee a drinka walk in the park
what about the plane?
what plane
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpitplay with the levers and things maverick well get used to it
used to what?
i'm different
let's make it at eight
he's gonna hurt you debbie he'll never be true to you the way i would
make what?
anything
why'd you do that?
it dies we live
you're an animal
that's true what are you?
no
it's not suffering anymore
you're horrible
you're not cause you eat frozen meatballs?    things die every time you breathe you kill millions of tiny organisms every time you eat something had to die
rick i want to talk to you
you don't have to kill it
somebody does it's more honest this way you do your own dirty work
you ever think about killing another human being?
does it bother you?
you know what really scares me? living too long losing my hair and my teethand my guts and my wind and my brainssitting in a room with my hands in my lap watching daytime tv
you don't believe any of this you don't think you'll ever die
that's it of course when i'm up there and doing it i'm cheating it every second i'm subverting all lawsgravitywhatever i'm skating the edge of it
what he said"there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result"
all you've got is one life i guess it's worth about the same to every body you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous you can look ahead maybe ten seconds that's your whole future that's as far as it goes but imagine what those seconds are worth
what if you kill yourself? think of everything you'll miss maverick there is lots of stuff i don't know about  fine wine great art the opera i guess if i live long enough i'll get to it if i don't i'll never miss it
i don't want any trouble
are you really that brave?
i watched my mother die cancer she had a long time to think about it they say you reach an agreement with death come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here i didn't see that she was very bravebraver than i am you go up there there isn't time to think if you make a mistake you're just a smudge on the ground simplifies funeral arrangements
it's just as i thought
you're totally insane
come on
where?
you want to go ballistic?
i always wanted to fly ever since i first saw a jet i wanted to fly jets then i wanted f14's then i wanted to fly off carriers then i wanted top gun
and now?
and now i want you
oh come on just a little
you always get what you want?
i want it understood
anything
no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk by anyone
why?
foodand youmy f14
in that order?
well noinverse order
i'm still second best
you ever fly an f14? 
i'm ready to make you another deal
danger?
 yeah
doesn't it ever bother you?
lucky charm
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross
just good luck
where'd you get it
they say you're alright
i'm fine
this is it then
ooh be still my heart
what?
the dark side the price you pay for all the fun you're having you knew about it of course didn't you?
he was a friend of mine a good guygreat guy it was my fault
that's not what i hear
i was flyingmy responsibility
that's what you get flight pay for
maybe i shouldn't take it
why? you act like you didn't know one day this would happen
not to me
where are we?
what would you call her?
great car
where are we? you know where we are it's called the beach it's where life first crawled up out of the sea i come here sometimes when i feel like crawling back in
you don't have to do this
do what show you a good time?
i'm not good company i should be alone
no
what do you want?
i want it back
what?
you look way out there out past the date line west becomes east all things change you cross the linetoday becomes yesterdayor tomorrow i forget which
that's what i want
the best
you don't believe that
hardly ever
only when you're depressed then it passes
it does
what do you do when you come here?
i sit i think i play games
what kind of games?
how do you play reality
it's strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play
strip reality how do you play that?
i love that car
it's like strip poker only without the bluffing  one person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off
you're crazy  that's a pretty silly game
want to play the game?
how does it go?
you say the truth  go ahead don't be afraid you want to win the game don'tcha?
what truth?
goose is dead
true
now?
take something off
i'll trade you my porsche for debbie an even swap
off me or off you?
what does it mean?
you didn't mean it you didn't think you'd do anything to take it back
that's three
one more
looks like a tie
who's gonna win?
you weren't gonna say goodbye?
i was later
long distance? i wouldn't do that to you i'd at least talk to you
the car for debbie?
i didn't want to see you i mean i didbut i didn't
i know exactly what you mean
how could you?
i've got a gift just like you do my gift is i just know what people mean even if they can't say it it helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots like what you just said was "i'm embarrassed i feel i've done something wrong that i've failed and i don't think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting intelligent woman like yourself" that about it?
and i'm gonna sneak off and be by myself for awhile like until i can think of a new careerhotel management or something
big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer
hey i never said i was a fighter piloti never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm i can find contentment in a good book i don't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire sometimesi just get happy being with the right man
i hope you find him
well?
well what?
i mean it the car is yours dump debbie
you got your f14 you got top gun you got your migsyou're our new top gun instructornow what?

it's a mig 21 they don't have radar missiles
let's hope you're right
what is he doing?
that's missile lock
he better be kidding

what do you mean? it doesn't get to look much better than that?
maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message  burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe  it could be to humiliate them just burning them up no proper funeral it's like condemning them to hell
cole when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
what are you doing?

mav's a great flyer but

the girl with the purple fingernails?
coogan spent half the night looking for her he said he was gonna kill the sonofabitch who ruined his sister

i think i can work it out on my own
you like to work alone i've heard that about you
i've heard of you too you were in 124 with bargamian
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet jester at what point did you call off the fight?
just below ten thousand
i've tried to change her mind
i don't know what to tell you skip
he's seat of the pants completely unpredictable  nothing by the book all over the sky but i don't know skip he's really got something
walked right into it
he just won't engage he can't do it skipper he can't get back on the horse
it's only been a week keep sending him up
i've seen this before
so have i
who's the hell is that?
three guesses
ah the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat
it's not her mind you need to change it's disneyland head in there
speaking of feet fuel's down to 40  we're gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station
iforgot something
what the hell you doing?
helping him in
you won?
it was bad
bad?
you didn't help
morning coogan
he's a good pilot
but how can i do that?
was going  now you are
you just did an incredibly brave thing what you should have done was land your plane you don't own that plane the taxpayers do i should ream you out for it but it just doesn't work with you you're a hell of a flyer you are maybe too good you never really stepped in it yet so this is your chance i'm gonna send you up against the best they are better than you maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see finally where discipline and teamwork fit it maverick hasn't really heard anything but topgun he snaps out of it
sir?
that is all tell me about the mig some other time
yes sir
considering the company you're in that's a pretty arrogant attitude
yes sir
maverick where'd you get that call sign?
ahhh runs in the family sir
you're father was marvin mitchell
thanks for the advise sir
yes sir
i had him in view i was peeling over the egg into a dive he saw me when i moved in for the kill there wasn't any danger
why?
we weren't below for more than ten seconds there was no danger i had the shot i took it
i wasn't thinking i just did it
snapshotmissed him
twenty years' experience i couldn't shake you you may be a great flyer i mean that
i lost
i can take care of myself
talent is no holy shield von richtofen was killed by a farm boy instincts are not enough do it our way we've worked these things out the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive    why do you have to do everything the hard way?
so he's playing hard ball well two can play that game  go after him stop at nothing you hear me?
it's my own way it works for me i don't care about the rest of that stuff
then why are you here?
for the same reason you are
oh you mean the thrill
how do you feel?
all right
goose is dead
he wasmy responsibilitymy rio
skipper sorry to bother you
no bother
i'll come with you
some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise
i called your house
my wife's house
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "cnc" course not completed no explanation required theoretically it doesn't hurt your career but people always wonder about things like that
or
or you can quit
i don't know
it's no disgrace kid that spin was hell it would wreck anyone's confidence you could be a good pilot again someday
you think i should quit?
sometimes it's luck but in this case he earned it i served with your old man
i know
well tell the asshole to shut up
vf 51 the oriskany you remind me of him you're just like he was only betterand worse
i'm nothing like him
you may not think so but you are
he was by the book all the way
they waved him off he thought he knew better he hit the ramp
i never heard that
not something they tell dependents
how can i go on? i feel so responsible
kid the plain fact isyou are i'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass technically they absolved you you and i know what really happened you pushed it you are responsible and you'll always carry that you know what i'll carry it too i should have taken you out of that cockpit i guess i'm a hopeless romantic i always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death it's no tradeoff it's not one for one what you learned isn't worth his death it couldn't be but maybe there is some value in it i know it's the first thing i've ever seen that's really gotten to you now the question is what will you do with it if it gets you out of flight statusso you don't kill yourself or anybody elsethat's good that's one good thing you were an accident waiting to happen
you think i shouldn't fly
right  hey shut up okay sir
i didn't say that that's up to you i think that if you do if you choose to come back you'll be a better pilot a better man
would you take me back? would they?
what's wrong with this one?
where's yours?
over there man
welcome to mars
what to the rebels want?
so where to?
the last resort
first time on mars?
cole my god boy what are you doing here? what happened?
yeahwell actually nosort of
tell me something; are all psychics uh?
freaks?'fraid so man  goes with the territory
what happened to them?
well there it is; the last resort  sure you wanna go in?
why not?
i know a much better place down the block  the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down
lemme ask you a question  ever fuck a mutant?
what happened to number five?
need a ride?
the bachelor party's upstairs they made me get naked they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down
shut up and drive
and if you wanna breathe you gotta but his air
but maybe you can change all that
how could you do this?  you're a mutant
what do you want?
don't bother looking  it's in your skull
who are you?
never mind  wet a towel and wrap it around your head  that'll muffle the signal
how'd you find me?
nice to have you back with us mr brubaker
take hold of yourself what room are they in?
thank you
would you like the same suite?
hmm  it seems you left something in our safe
get it please
i'll go encode your room key
there you go mr brubaker  suite 610 in the east wing
well my boy you're a hero
fuck you
you see quaid none of my people could get close to kuato  the fucking mutants could always sniff us out  so hauser and i sat down and invented you: the perfect mole
he's lying  hauser turned against you
1002
that's what we wanted you to think the fact is hauser volunteered to become doug quaid it was the only way to fool the psychics
get your story straight  this idiot's been trying to kill me since i went to rekall  you don't kill somebody you're trying to plant
he wasn't in on it  you set him off by going to rekall
so why am i still alive?
the guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form hauserall of that was set up by us
sorry  too perfect
well cohaagen i have to hand it to youthis is the best mindfuck yet
don't take my word for it quaid someone you trust wants to talk to you
the guy's a fucking asshole
come on cohaagen  you got what you want  give these people air
all right i'll go up there and take care of this myself  you look awful son go find yourself some clothes
what are you afraid of?  turn it on
impossible  once the reaction starts it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet  mars will go into global meltdownthat's why the aliens never turned it on
do you expect me to believe you?
i didn't want it to end this way  i wanted hauser back  but nooo  you had to be quaid
i am quaid
what the fuck is going on down there?
i'm trying to neutralize a traitor
if i wanted him dead you moron i wouldn't have dumped him on earth
we can't let him run around  he knows too much
lori says he can't remember jack shit
cole?
that's now  in an hour he could have total recall
richter do you know why i'm such a happy person?
no sir
he had help  from our side sir
i know that
but i thought
who told you to think?  i don't give you enough information to think  you do what you're told  that's what you do
now let's get down to business  kuato wants what's in quaid's head  and he might be able to get it cause they say he's psychic  now i have a little plan to keep this from happening  do you think you can play along?
yes sir
stop fighting and get out
cole we've got to talk
they've got quaid  they're protecting him
perfectget out of sector g  now don't think  do it
i say we throw the switch and see what happens
kill him
bob?
what is it?
i'm with an very important client
what the fuck is going on here?  you can't install a simple goddamn double implant?
listen to me  he's been going on and on about mars  he's really been there
use your head you dumb bitch  he's acting out the secret agent role from his ego trip
there wasn't a fire  there'll be nothing for you to do
finally realized rick's a jerk huh?
i'm afraid that's not possible
why not?
oh shitoh shit
okay this is what we're gonna do renata cover up any memory he has of us or rekall
i'll do what i can  it's getting messy in there
ernie dump him in a cab  around the corner  tiffany you help him  i'll destroy his file and refund his money  and if anybody comes askingwe've never heard of douglas quaid
good evening  doug  i'm dr lull
twoheaded monsters?

ya know doc you could have folled me
amazing  where are we?
you're strapped into an implant chair and i'm monitoring you at a psychoprobe console
oh i get it; i'm dreaming  and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me
not exactly  what you're experiencing is a freeform delusion based on our memory tapes  but you're inventing it yourself as you go along
well if this is my delusion who invited you?
i've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure  i'm sorry to tell you this mr quaid but you've suffered a schizoid embolism we can't snap you out of your fantasy i've been sent in to try to talk you down
how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
think about it  your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure everything after thatthe chases the trip to mars your suite here at the hiltonthese are all elements of your rekall holiday  and ego trip: you paid to be a secret agent
bullshit  it's all coincidence
cole listen to me i've got to tell you
what about the girl?  brunette athletic sleazy and demure; just like you specified  is that a coincidence?
she's real  i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall
mr quaid can you hear yourself? "she's real because you dreamed her?"
you open it
suppose i dothen what?
what is it?
mr cohaagen wants to see you right away

honey do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning
just think about it
sweetheart we've been through this a million times  you'd hate it on mars it's dry; it's ugly; it's boring  i mean really a revolution could break out there any minute
cohaagen says it's just a few extremists
but a fabulous cook
and you believe him?
doug maybe we should take a trip
lori move
wellwhat do you say?
sweethearti know it's hard being in a new town but let's at least give it a chance here  okay?
you are somebody  you're the man i love
what are you doing?
muggers?  doug are you all right? what happened?
harry from workhe was the boss
take it easy  tell me exactly what happened?  why would "spies" want to kill you?
what are we having?
i don't know  it had something to do with mars
mars?  you've never even been to mars
i know it sounds crazy but i went to this rekall place after work and
you went to those brain butchers?
let me finish
what did they do to you?  tell me
i got a trip to mars
oh god doug
forget rekall will you  these men were going to kill me
doug nobody tried to kill you
it's either meatloaf swiss steak or charred flesh i won't know till it's finished
you call this a paranoid delusion?
not talk  i said talk
i'm not your wife
the hell you're not
i swear to godi never saw you before six weeks ago  our marriage is just a memory implant  agghh
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
it was implanted by the agency
and falling in love?
implanted
our friends my job eight years together i suppose all this was implanted too?
don't worry it's supposed to do this
the job's real  but the agency set it up
ok then  if i'm not me then who the hell am i?
but dougthere's something i want you to know  you're the best assignment i ever hand  really
i'm honored
you sure you don't wanna?  for old time's sake  if you don't trust me you can tie me up
i didn't know you were so kinky
clever girl
dougyou wouldn't shoot me would you?  after all we've been through?
i suppose you're not here either
i love you
want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower it's really gonna be fun
right  that's why you tried to kill me
nooo  i would never do anything to hurt you  i want you to come back to me
then i can pull this trigger and it won't matter
dougbob mcclane
nice to meet you
now help me out here doug  you were interested in a memory of
mars
right  mars
that a problem?
to be perfectly honest with you doug if outer space is your thing i think you'd be much happier  with one of our saturn cruiseseverybody raves about 'em
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me
i'm not interested in saturn  i said mars
let's seethe basic mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninetynine credits  that's for two full weeks of memories complete in every detail  a longer trip'll run you a little more cause you need a deeper implant
what's in the two week package?
first of all doug when you go rekall you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the hilton; plus all the major sights:  mount pyramid the grand canals and of course  venusville
how real does it seem?
as real as any memory in your head
come on don't bullshit me
i'm telling you doug your brain won't know the difference  guaranteed or your money back
what about the guy you lobotomizeddid he get a refund?
all right
you're going to have a bachelor party?
smart move  now while you fill out the questionnaire i'll familiarize you with some of our options
no options
i give up
you  you're the same  no matter where you go there you are always the same old you  let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself  i know it sounds wild but it's the latest thing in travel we call it an "ego trip"
i'm not interested in that
secret agenthow much is that?
go on
they'll be here any minute  they'll kill you all
what's he talking about?
i love you
of course i'm a traditional guy it's a traditional event  well what do you think?
ooo whatcha been feeding that thing?
blondes
i thought cohaagen tortured you to death
i guess he didn't
what?
i don't remember you
what are you talking about?
what did you get amnesia?how'd you get here?
hauser left me a note
hauser?  you're hauser
this isn't homicide school
it looks awful
hauser you're lost your mind
i didn't lose it  cohaagen stole it he found out that hauser switched sidesso he turned him into somebody else  me
this is too weird
then he dumped me on earth with a wife and a lousy job and 
she wasn't really my wife
oh she isn't really your wife  how stupid of meshe was hauser's wife
forget i said wife
no let's forget everything  i've had it with you and your goddamn lies
why would i lie to you?
because you're still working for cohaagen
yes but looks are deceiving  not in this case however
don't be ridiculous
you never loved me hauser  you just used me to get inside
i think you better leave
melina hauser sent me to do something
i'm not falling for it
he said there's enough in here to nail cohaagen for good
i said get out
i thought you didn't like me
so you dropped by to apologize?
now what?
are you going to have women at your party?
by the wayever heard of a company names rekall?
i used to model for 'em why?
not bad for a hooker
the first settlers are buried here they worked themselves to death but cohaagen ended up with all the money he built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks
what can i do?
kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were hauser
like what?
all sorts of things  you might even remember you loved me
i don't need kuato for that
he's lying
no sweetheart it's a stag party does stay home
are you all right?  are you still you?
where are you going?
the reactor
what reactor?
the one in the mine
where's this "reactor" come from?
aliens built it
you sure about this?
cohaagen knows it makes air  but the bastard won't turn it on
the whole core of mars is ice  the reactor melts it and releases oxygen
i'm not talking about does i'm talking about hookers
what's wrong?
i just has a terrible thoughtwhat is this is all a dream?
this is the suitcase you gave me
i gave you?
wait
what?
who are you?
we were buddies in the agency back on mars  you asked me to find you if you disappeared  so here i am goodbye
rhonda  rhonda lebeck  she's getting some kind of strange readings on her things
or a big mother slug maybe?
oh those why do you ask?

what's under the ground?  we're not getting up on the roof  earth shelter's the best  known that since i was a kid
let's go you two  we're headed for the mountains
that's fine  we've got some new things to teach them
stop fooling around i need to talk
jesus christ we're only going nine miles  be there in two hours tops

well we'll ask around  let you know if we hear of anything
thanks  god i hope they're not screwed up  i might have to bag the whole semester anyway sorry to bother you
jesus christthink it smells like that 'cause it's dead?
i don't see any eyesmust be totally subterraneanand those tentacles
i think they shoot right outta its mouth hook you and pull you right in  good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else
well at least the bastard can't climb  pardon my french
there's nothing like them in the fossil record i'm sureokay so they predate the fossil record  that'd make them a couple of billion years oldand we've just never seen one till now  right
what's the matter?
i might have an idea
we're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death
i'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here
well i'm scared but i'm not sorry
you know up the jeep trail
well we can take my truck then
oh my god
he'll never make it  they're gonna get him
we're not going over there right?
sonow what?
my parents are from poland  i can help with the eastern european angle
i don't know i just feel scared
where the hell are they?  hope they didn't wise up
hi guys  burt loaned me his camera
howdy rhonda
you're really leaving huh?
you bet  you gonna be staying up here?
you didn't cook breakfast?
did it yesterday  franks and beans
noit was eggs  i did eggs
how many cows does it take to make a stampede?  is it like three or more?  is there a minimum speed?
if there was one nearby i'd probably ask him
about what?
i keep thinking if we were but half serious about money we should quit being hired hands and
handymen earl  we're handymen
goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year
you're gonna get us hung up
uhdigging that waterhole for nestor
burt and heather's place is closer let's do their kitchen today  do nestor tomorrow
who the hell's that?  that's not what's his namethe grad student?
nah it's september  must be the new one
you know if you wanted we could take a look at those seismographs for her
what the hell do we know about seismographs?
the wedding my parents your family our friends my job the future our relationship the caterers my gown your tuxedo our honeymoon the apartment my shower your bachelor party
nothing  but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her
why?
goddamnit valentine you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z
well sure
tammy lynn baxter
don't matter  they're all the same: dead weight  can't make a decision can't walk because of their shoes can't work because of their fingernails  make my skin crawl
well i'm a victim of circumstance
catch it later pham  gotta get over to nestor's
why don't his parents ever take him to vegas with them?
so what if we just did ittoday pack up  drive straight down to bixby  get serious
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union sweetheart everything's gonna be all right
we could  we could  but we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious  it's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place
so?  that car wash pays good and they're always looking
car wash?  that's got no future if we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that
well <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash  you're the one's gotta have a plan
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet  i was up for going to bixby  i was getting excited
in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection  we gotta better ourselves"  you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here?  you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right <u>now</u>?
uh oh it's nancy  she wants another load of firewood
she's got us  now listen the plan is: we have done our last job in perfection
we did it  we faced temptation and we did not bend
so long cactus
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
jeez look at that guy
one job i'd never take is working around electricity
you're full of shit
reckon he hated perfection more than us?  you suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
if he did why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger
oh sure he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  come on sombody must've chased him up there
well whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place
probably up a pole starving itself to death
okay the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way  we don't stop till we hit the carwash not even to pee
that feels so great
oh jesus
brother we decided to leave this place just one day too late you know?
those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road  hey  where are you guys?  people gotta use this road you know you on a booze break or what?
jesus  i don't <u>believe</u> this
you're hung up again
fuck you
it must've grabbed us  that's why the truck stalledout
slick as snot and i'm not lying
fifteen lousy bucks
pham we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners  they better be fast
good
relax  a snake thing like that couldn't move too quick
you want the rifle or the smith?
that means we're gonna be out here like in the dark
car's gone  we just missed them that's all
here's the planwe don't <u>even</u> stop  ride like hell  tonight we keep right on going  we'll walk the horses
that <u>is</u> the plani mean goddamn it  what the hell are those things?  how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon?
shut up  they got wind of something they don't like
what the hell are they?
this is one big mother
hey rhonda you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
um that's very relaxing
pham van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks
here's the plan: we'll get aa flatbed i guess with a big winch figure a five ton anyway
we'll take your word for it
prairie dog burrow
god the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones
i don't know  if this one's any faster than that other one
wellhaven't seen a sign for hours  maybe it's long gone
maybe it is  why don't you take a little stroll and see?
son of a bitch
son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch  been waiting there all this time  how the hell's it even know we're still here?
well twentyfour more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness
you know i hate to be crude but i'm gonna have to take care of some business here
well folks what's the plan?
don't he have a home to go to?
run for it?  running's not a plan running is what you do when the plan fails  you're not even trying to come up with a plan
you go north i'll go south
you're right don't matter where they come from
i'm gonna kick his ass
shut it up  shut the little bastard up
how the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
just about too damn long  bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway
you better not have too much joy
wait a minutethe cat  could we take the cat?
jesus  it's slower than hell
butwe could pull something  we could i don't know drag a car behind it
a car huh?  like a big armored car?  need something bigger tougherour truck maybeor hell that old semi trailer
its tires are flat
doesn't matter  the cat can pull <u>any</u>thing
wellall <u>right</u>  we just roll on out of here
<u>i'm</u> making the run to the cat
like hell you are
get real  i'm faster than you
you're polish?
wouldn't think of it because tomorrow  we're going to the chapel and we're
<u>i'm</u> best at driving the cat
watch your ass shithead

hi i'm rhonda  rhonda lebeck i'm up here for the semester
yeah geography
listen got a question for you  do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
around here?  why would they?
well i'm supposed monitor these seismographs  you know they measure vibrations
yeah vibrations in the ground
darn it
you okay?
think it's still following us?
your mother's not dead
ready?
rhonda's got an idea about that
you paying attention?  this oughta hurt like hell
what's it doing?
yeah they're confused  they can feel our vibrations but they can't find us
what?  since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?
look the situation hasn't changed we still have to get to solid rock there must be <u>some</u> way
listen they only respond to vibration right?  couldn't we distract them somehow?
i think the ground's getting closer  i think we do it  we're gonna save our asses here
wait  how are you going to know they're all following it?
have a good time don't make it too late
it worked  there they go
i brought it to the coroner
from chinatown which is right up the street from the morgue where did you go with the body? what did you do with it?
you're fishing you don't know shit
we had to lick his boots clean
he was your snitch
our own colombian connection for three years three years of ball breaking detective work and we put a lotta bad guys behind bars
demerol? what the fuck is your problem man? you wanna die?
where're we goin'?
thataboy hospital
anything you say ma'am have a fun shower use soap
i don' need a hospital i feel fine
the photo on the left shows the bullet that killed jimmy chin true?
true
and the one on the right is the bullet you testfired from shu's gun?
you would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
or this  is this a significant difference?
forensic ballistics isn't an exact science is it?
it most certainly is
isn't there a ten to fifteenpercent margin of error?
absolutely not no more than seven percent
don't turn on the lights sugar  i'll lead you around
ms vin's sister
i have to talk to your brother
gimme back my bottle
don't hurt him
where's the nearest hospital?
objection your honor the fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial
i will allow the witness to testify with the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of mr kim's modus operandi
 with objection
your honor that's not fair  
objection
in 9th  for a month
my folks are
how wonderful a seeing eye hooker
i move that the witness's testimony be stricken he has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution he's 
good morning mr dowd do you think you might be up to crossexamining mr ortega this morning?
well then does the defense have any witnesses?
 then you don't wish to call any witnesses mr dowd?
you can't come back here anything happens to you i'm liable
i'm a lawyer the firm is thinking about renovating everything dates back to the sixties
i noticed
look i'm a lawyer and 
 i don't care who you are you could've been killed every man and woman in here has done hard prison time and we look out for each other
"we"?
i can't trust you
"art's supplies" is founded on trust mister 
dowd eddie dowd
what "everything"? you shot a corpse i don't give a shit about that  
let's snuff this lowlife
hey  the fact you popped jimmy chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated jury'll sympathize  dude was banging your wife right?
clyde you wait here  glenn got a minute?
i had a minute before the mapp hearing  but i couldn't get you on the phone eddie
no it's not the only issue there's another issue for the jury what about entrapment?
we don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak judge brandeis said it best: entrapment is a "dirty business"
haven't heard that one before ed  but i guess i'll be hearing it again
c'mon i knew it was you
come now did you see the gun?
i can describe it
oh really?
it was silver with a stubby barrel snubnosed i think they call it it wasn't automatic it had one of those cylinders
you can't remember that  
i can see the hammer still it was cocked
how can you remember that?
i didn't take my eyes off it
not the whole time of course i 
exactly what information led you to arrest my client just twoandahalf hours after the shooting took place?
let go of me
we had a description of the suspect
we had information bearing on mr kim's desire to gain admission into the joe boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang
you're implying that i planted a gun?
not at all 
kim's prints were all over it  he admitted it was his gun f'r godsake
you see that? you wanna be like that?
no no
we have a full caseload rog
right i forgot we're pledged to protect every midlevel drug dealer in the tristate area  it's an awesome responsibility
i don't venerate drug dealers roger to the contrary
debbie i'm telling you i didn't do anything hardly
of course
through use of informants eavesdropping unreasonable search and seizure
right you're right
it's just i leave behind friends family a coupla good job offers in chicago and in three dizzying weeks i've helped acquit a coke dealer a speed dealer 
i specialize roger
 an angel dust dealer 
i'm not a kid anymore i can't be all over the map 
 a speed manufacturer 
so go take your job on wall street
don't tell me where to work i moved to new york to work for edward dowd but i can't believe that edward dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little 
the marriage is off now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life
ten years is a long time
where?
kim got busted at 19 for burglary at 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young chinese gang lord the prosecution claimed kim did it to get into "the joe boys"?
chinatown street gang
kim denied it but he admitted the gun was his and he got life seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years til the incident with duane lindeman
at the trial you said you were at your apartment that night alone
so what would we claim? he stabbed duane lindeman in selfdefense?
i feel like i've been mugged guy scared the shit out of me you made your point eddie i'm relieved we're not taking the case
we're taking the other case
what other case?
i don't want that i want to be with you
some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists the mayor pressures the cops the cops pressure the rival gang  the joe boys the joes give up shu kai kim  the schmuck kid from korea who's been pestering 'em to get in
you really think that's what happened?
 easy as that huh?
easy? no we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried to reopen the sucker
when did you start working for the goddam da?
eddie what's a dd5?
a complaint followup form
 listen: "november 5 1980 cecil stipe walked into 5th precinct says he witnessed chin shooting saw suspect's picture in post says shu kai kim wrong man"
that dd5
what the lunatic who 
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment
do you have to do that?
shoulda told the one about shu being the bastard child of mother theresa
his name is chuckie roeder but something's very weird
they're just frightened fuckedup losers that prison fucked up worse
i didn't ask for a closing argument
there's no one else to talk to the tattoos were phony
 yeah?
so an upstanding member of the aryan warriors wouldn't paint them on they take those teardrops seriously  they're badges of courage of honor only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them
i feel much better now
uh eddie? the um ballistics guy george? he called and  his tests show that shu's gun fired the bullet that killed jimmy chin
i don't believe you
a fucking wheelchair?
eddie dowd
goddam it the little punk bests me again i get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
1530 rivington street
 what?
chuckie's address i sneaked a peek at the rolodex
so what're we gonna do?
what do you mean?
well i mean roeder's gone now a dead end believe me i'm sorry too but
but what?
see? and these are not just ordinary partygoers  there are professionals in this crowd  i didn't want any of them you you're what i want understand?
i've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list it's an even ten who say shu's gun killed jimmy chin
that's why i hate experts
eddie it's one thing to compare clyde gruner to jesus christ it's even okay to claim that shu kai kim is just slightly holier than the pope as long as you don't really believe it
hey  you believe what you want shu kai kim is innocent
 eddie
you're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend  i don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns
but roeder's dead ballistics says it's shu we don't have one witness  unless we put cecil stipe on the stand
i'm not that desperate
i am eddie  we've got nothing
i've got a meeting in chinatown
you goin' to the escort service?
yes
let's get a cab
eddie  it's art esparza
what's art esparza?
i think he hired shu to kill jimmy chin it wasn't a chinatown gang hit  jimmy chin and art's wife were lovers she just about told me
you phoned up art esparza's wife?
 what?
they could've been brothers it's why the eyewitnesses picked shu
"the killer wasn't chinese" cecil stipe was right 
jesus
how long did it take badalato to drive jimmy chin's body from chinatown to the morgue?
great now what do you want to do about it?
you're the police expert in chinatown gangs?
for ten years now
do you speak cantonese mandarin or both?
pardon which dialect do you speak?
they're chinamen who speak english we call them informants
murder witness
you're doing a murder case?
stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward kitty y'oughta start looking for the others
lemme guess some corporate vp's banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder
beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors
let's get naked
just which constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle pcp?
forget it you've blown your chance to participate in this case kitty
start looking into the joe boys  who assigned the hits in 1980 what rank generally did the hits  your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use
i embellished
"dowd also reports that his team of private investigators"?
i embroidered
"are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin"?
so there goes your theory about the joes giving up shu to protect their trigger man
i've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the tristate area no one's heard of chuckie roeder
a fucking wheelchair?
are you okay?
i didn't put him in a wheelchair reynard did he can get around without one  it's all in my report
 find him?
the joe boys in 1980
i haven't thanked you for your work kitty you're doing good work
i'm a professional eddie getting paid is all the thanks i require
i haven't paid you
got any booze in the house?
you don't drink "booze"
you do
eddie this is silly are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and 
yeah
eddie a guilty client's not the end of the world
eddie go home get some sleep
i don't need sleep
i need sleep some of us are mere mortals
my mother find you?
that's right
figures
want to tell me what went down here?
racist asshole came at me
exactly what happened then?
this has been quite a night here's a thought why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
i killed the motherfucker
an aryan warrior with black teardrops painted on his face
but why would a guy would do that? paint black teardrops on his face?
i guess he wanted you to think he was somebody he wasn't
but why?
maybe because someone's afraid
afraid of what?
i don't know the truth maybe
 about what?
about chinatown what went down
if i were you i'd worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party
what went down?
you tell me man
no you tell me shu
how can i tell you what i don't know
you can't so tell me what you do know  say it
i don't know shit man goddammit 
no
i'm dying out there
quite a bit you didn't tell me
i didn't need to know that a man i'm defending on a gangmurder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs?
ilene why would i want to do that? i trust rick
it was selfdefense
 how could i help you?
when you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid where's our bond? i'm going back to my cell and wait to die so tell me: where's our bond?
'lo cecil
seecil
oh come on cecil
i did two tours in 'nam
are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot jimmy chin was not the man the cops arrested?
they ggot the wrong gguy
when the da hears i filed the writ he'll send someone here maybe claiming to be a journalist that person will ask you lots of questions just be truthful cecil okay? to all of us?
of course you do i trusted my ex mel too cousin i can only talk from experience what do you think they do at these parties have tea and play scrabble?
you told the desk sergeant you were certain mr kim wasn't the killer?  you left your telephone number?
yyes sir
did the police make any attempt to phone you to follow up?
no ssir
i'd llike to answer the question
edward t dowd
of course you know dean rabin one of my assistant das dean generally handles nuisance cases like the what's the man's name?
shu kai kim
you won't remember this but in '72 i was one of several prosecutors assigned to the black pantherpolice shootout  we had a whole team and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt  so what've you been up to since then?
this and that
ilene rick promised
my staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers i said that can't be the same edward dowd
it's in the area of narcotics mr reynard that the government tramples on the fourth amendment
i'm sorry if i've ruined your day mr reynard but my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and 
back in the seventies i spent years putting away gangsters in a colombian syndicate called "the ochoa" these guys are very dangerous ed when i hear that a smalltime dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys i see red
now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in society's side or you want to walk into any restaurant in chinatown and get free dumplings
are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
yes but that's not the issue what's on your wish list ed? pleading kim out to first degree man on both homicides with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? come on what're you looking for here?
what am i looking for? you're the one talking deal
friday's the dropdead date on the offer
please don't bullshit me mr reynard you've got witness problems you've got proof problems
you got any better ideas?
are you sure this is a good idea?
i see: he'd walk out next month
that's right
we reconvict your man's looking at 25 years on two counts served consecutively so what i'd like to ask ed is: are you joking?
i never joke about waiving a client's sixth amendment right to trial
you're pissing me off again ed
but now you've strayed from your area of expertise  dope  into street assassins a subject on which you're dangerously ignorant
but i'm a quick study tell your deputy da  rabin?  that i'll see him in court
i'll prosecute anyone who fucks up if that makes me look racist it's a tradeoff i'll live with ed
isn't it a fact that the "six other asian men" in the lineup were all of the classic mongoloid type whereas shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean?
objection the witness is not an expert in racial classification
look you heard what those hookers said they were supposed to go to a bachelor party
isn't it a standard trick to pack a lineup with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
isn't it unusual for a man who's just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment?
you don't speak any chinese dialects? then you get your intelligence from snitches?
to the best of your recollection were you sober when you performed the tests?
your honor that's trial by ambush
we just discovered him your honor his appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case he is an inmate at ossining correctional and 
 objection your honor this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with
the witness is recalcitrant your honor  i had to personally make a body attachment this morning  it took two marshalls to drag him here
the great personal sacrifices endured by mr reynard have no bearing on the legal issues your honor  
your honor i know as much about these gangs as anyone; i'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked i assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime 
that doesn't mean it was rick's party
 alleged crime 
 can't mr dowd find his own expert witness your honor?
yes mr dowd
didn't this investigation with its attendant publicity catapult you into the office you now hold?
did you do any handson work or did you just supervise from on high?
mr dowd i was personally involved with all phases  and principals  of the investigation
lou sklaroff vin badalato dave montell
in those days they often worked as a team
i don't think i know that name
 but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation
let's go
i can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact
i didn't say he was an informant but since you mentioned it wasn't esparza your primary informant?
isn't it true that without esparza you had no investigation?
i think you're a dangerous man mr dowd
no
you read eddie's chase manhattan bombing summation in the leftist law anthology?
my skiptrace turned up two cecil stipes one's in butte montana other's at riverhead veterans psychiatric
i'll take odds on cecil number two
you getting this?
 every word
look girls  i'll stay behind and hold them off the rest of you break for it
it's okay it was always like that
shouldn't one of us?
what do you want?
what were you why were you at shu's trial this afternoon?
i followed you here from court
i knew jimmy chin the boy who was shot okay?
and you were at the trial to to see that justice was done?
then it was your idea to have chuckie roeder scare eddie off the case?
 why don't you ask chuckie?
look mister 
ilene are you crazy?
 roger 
mr ortega you've known the defendant at ossining correctional for how long?
five years
mr ortega what is "la compania"?
a cubano army basically inside and outside prisons
and its purpose?
fighting the aryan warriors and the black guerrillas basically
for control of the prison drug trade?
do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
yeah we do some of that
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year
"name rank and serial" mr ortega let's not hide behind the fifth
i'm a soldado in the gwing regiment
and what does a soldado  a soldier  do?
a soldado he runs messages and materiel between the regiments
"materiel"? what do you mean by that?
cigarettes candy bars  pcp crack
if a member of the aryan brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
a soldado he takes care of it
by "takes care of" you mean "kills"
mr ortega what is shu kai kim's rank within la compania?
why is cole here?
soldado
isn't it unusual for an asian to be accepted into a cuban prison gang?
shu's the only one i know of
and why was an exception made?
chinatown sounded pretty cold
you're a llawyer?  i i haven't had my meds or mmy vital signs ttaken yet i
mr stipe a young man named jimmy chin was shot to death eight years ago in chinatown do you remember talking to the police?
i think what eddie wants to say is 
cia?
telephone  i suppose you don't know the phone company killed kennedy because he was trying to bbreak it up  and they'll never let that happen they control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end and 
a strange wang right in my palm
the phone company was broken up
cooper the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads do you honestly think cole's practice of word association works?
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association the world is a hologram albert
yes it's a great big psychedelic circus ride isn't it cooper?
albert
you said "teresa banks" so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
yes either right now or right when i thought of it the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again because it is only a feeling i am powerless to stop it and another thing albert when the next murder happens you will help me solve it
let's test it for the record will the next victim be a man or a woman?
a woman
what color hair will she have?
what kind of job? i'm a housewife
blonde
tell me some other things about her
she's in high school she's sexually active she's on drugs she's crying out for some help
you're describing half the high school girls in america  what is she doing right now?
no no go away
i'm glad you let me talk to you you used to not let me talk to you
go away i am not talking to you
see what we can do to donna?
that's not important i will tell you what is important the fan will soon be starting
who are you? who are you really?
mind if i ride along with you?
i hope ilene's all right
no

they left an hour ago pink nuts
there was only one job teresa took the job her friend took a hike never saw her again
did you ever see teresa take cocaine?
no
do you take cocaine irene?
he's with me  anything you would like to tell us about teresa banks that would help us out?
i've thought about that i think her death is what you would call a "freak accident"
you know i never told anybody but once for about three days just before her time teresa's arm went completely dead
what do you mean?
her left arm it was numb she said she couldn't use it said it had no feeling probably from the drugs she was taking  i just thought i ought to tell you
that was really something  that dancing girl  what did it mean?
that's it prick lips
code if you work with gordon you learn that right away
sort of shorthand
shorthand really?
we're heading into a difficult situation
how do you figure?
lil was wearing a sour face
what do you mean?
oh the uncle is missing
not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison
so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime
what are you
right which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation let me ask you something stanley did you notice anything about the dress?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight
gordon said you were good the tailored dress is our code for drugs did you notice what was pinned to it?
a blue rose
what did gordon's tie mean?
what? that's just gordon's bad taste
why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
he talks loud and he loves his code
i see he does talk loud
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation
i've had it numb nuts how much money you got?
solved the whiteman case with this
that's what i heard
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this and no one had a machine like this
that's good
yes it is good  what do you think is in these other drawers?
i don't know sam
maybe later we could take a look
crushed skull probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age
there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand
accidental?
why?
what is it?
geez agent desmond it's threethirty in the morning where are we going to sleep?
we're not you and i are going to get some food
agent desmond it's
it's late sam
i doubt it was drugs more likely a problem with a nerve i could recheck the arm for injuries but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland
i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park
are you speaking to me in a code?
no sam i'm speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say
she lived alone
this is bad public relations i was planning to do a lot of business with you but now i'm going to have to go elsewhere
you better dust this place sam
take a look at this
my guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring but we should do a blowup of this anyway
i couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer you did think that didn't you agent desmond?
he's not the murderer  but he's a bozo
when he says "discussion" how do you take that agent desmond?
one thing that has been troubling me that lamp at the diner do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
faulty wiring
esthetics are subjective aren't they agent desmond?  i'm sam stanley if you ever need me
thanks sam for the good work you have a good eye for detail
give him the works
if i am going to get through math today you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick
you didn't do your homework?
noooo
okay this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week you remember the
don't tell me now tell me right before the test i won't be able to remember long enough
you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen

mr abraham

abrams yes how are you today?
you are being in luck customers in same hotel i let you have them at cutrate price for 45 minutes
i'm fine
good  you ever been inside a hospital?
yes
why did he go to see mary rooney?
she's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the doctors
what did he find?
nothing
how good's your intelligence?
very good
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr thompson?
sold 45 minutes no problem
he was accused of jury tampering
accused not indicted he resigned the firm divorced nineteen seventy galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy eight since then he's been on his own four cases before the circuit court he lost them all he drinks
four cases in three years
the man's an ambulance chaser
tell me about this case
this is a nuisance suit he's looking for small change he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court
no  we don't want this case in court
neither does he that's where he loses this man's scared to death to go to court we only have to call his bluff
i want to settle this thing and be done with it i don't want the archdiocese exposed
no absolutely and we're going to see that it is not
not one minute longer or milt will come for you
so what i want to do is stop it here i'm going to make him an offer i want to do it myself i want it to come from me
if we were to go to trial would we win the case?
well of course it's always dangerous
i know that answer if we went to trial would we win?
it's a generous offer mr galvin  nothing can make the woman well but we try to compensate to make a gesture
how did you settle on the amount?
we thought it was just
you thought it was just
yes
because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount two hundred ten thousand that would mean i keep seventy
so larry how have you been?
that was our insurance company's recommendation
nothing that we can do can make that woman well
and no one will know the truth
what is the truth?
what are you doing here?
here's your mail call mrs doneghy
yes get her on the phone
that was a dr david gruber's office
gruber
he wants to testify?
i hate her i hate her guts the bitch
it looks that way
you know what that would mean?
to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he'll testify?
this is going to drive the ante up
that's the call that i'm waiting for
what does it mean?
they want to settle  it means a lot of money
you are aware of the penalties for perjury?
it's a crime
yes  it is a crime a serious crime
larry you and your wife got problems?
i wouldn't do it
you would not?
no
in fact you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury you've just sworn to that isn't that right?
yes
just now
yes
sworn before god you would tell the truth?
yes
now i'd like to ask you something: four years ago when you were working as a nurse are you aware that drs towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed?
is that all the coke in the place?
i
and wasn't that an oath? these are your initials here: kc when you signed this chart you took an oath no less important than that which you took today  isn't that right?  isn't that right?
i yes
then please which is correct? you've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? which is the lie when were you lying?
i
they lied
'they lied' indeed when did they lie? and do you know what a lie is?
i do yes
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
that's not my handwriting
two heads
that's it
you've just said you signed it
yes i yes i signed it yes but i i didn't write that figure
you didn't write that figure and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? this is a why? why would you do that?
i thought i would need it
and why please tell us would you think that?
dr thompson just so the jury knows you never treated deborah ann kaye is that correct?
that is correct i was engaged to render an opinion
engaged to render an opinion for a price is that correct? you're being paid to be here today?
just as you are sir
you want to share it?
are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor?
no i am not it's quite common in new york state
i'm sure it is but this is massachusetts doctor certified in internal medicine?
no
neurology?
no
orthopedics?
i'm just an md
do you know dr robert towler?
i know of him
naw two on a quaalude bad luck
how is that?
through through his book
what book is that?
meth methodology and technique
of anesthesiology?
'methodology and techniques of anesthesiology' yes
how old are you?
i am seventyfour years old
uhhuh still practice a lot of medicine?
i'm on the staff of
my marriage is the worst all crap a big pile of shit
yes we've heard that doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? isn't that right? you you're available for that? when you're paid to be there?
sir yes when a thing is wrong as in this case i am available i am seventyfour years old i am not boardcertified
i have been practicing medicine for fortysix years and i know when an injustice has been done
i did
ed concannon
objection we've
to get her heartbeat back?
we've touched on this his own witness has said
almost nine minutes causing brain damage
objection
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while
your honor bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars
huh
mr concannon?
nothing further your honor
objection this is ri expect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right
no further questions
thank you your honor we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana us 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code: 'the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed' and your honor having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the xerox form
the document is disallowed the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form  it's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original
thank you your honor further: ms costello is a rebuttal witness as a 'surprise witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here
no actually she was referred to me she was dr hagman's patient
she hates me it's over you'll see as soon as you get married everything changes you sure you want to go through with it man?
whatever the 'truth' is let's hear that you were her doctor
yes
say it
i was her doctor
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy
i was one of a group of
answer affirmatively simply keep those answers to three words you weren't 'part of a group' you were her anesthesiologist isn't that right?
yes
you were there to help dr marx deliver her baby were you not?
anything special about the case?
guys i think i'd rather stay here
thank you when debby
dr towler who was in the operating room with you?
mary rooney the obstetrical nurse
what did these people do when her heart stopped?
we went to code blue
'code blue' what does that mean?
it's a common medical expression it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat dr marx cut an airway in her trachea to get her oxygen her and the baby ms nevins
why wasn't she getting oxygen?
well many reasons actually
tell me one?
c'mon larry be good for you
she'd aspirated vomitus into her mask
and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen
that's right
and what did your team do
well we
you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear isn't that what you did?
yes
a patient riddled with complications questionable information on her on her admitting form
we did everything we could
to save her and to save the baby is that
i just want to be alone
yes
you reached down into death now isn't that right?
my god we tried to save her you can't know you can't know
please sit down i told your wife i'm sorry that we have to meet out here i've got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers
that's all right
the archdiocese called up they said who was our attorney 'cause the case is coming to trial
i doubt we'll have to go to trial
we told them we didn't want it to come out this way
i completely understand
what is this going to cost?
lar sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean
you said you're gonna call me up you didn't call me up who do you think you are?  who do you think you are?
hold on a second
it's all right mickey
you ruined my life mister me and my wife and i am going to ruin yours  you don't have to go out there to see that girl we been going four years  four years my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they what what they did to her sister
i swear to you i wouldn't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case
what you thought? what you thought i'm a workingman i'm trying to get my wife out of town we hired you we're paying you i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred
i'm going to win this case mist mr doneghy i'm going to the jury with a solid case a famous doctor as an expert witness and i'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars
if i could accept the offer right now i would  they took it back
dr thompson?
i have some errands to run and then i thought we'd spend the evening
leon  meet us at 63rd and madison hair salon  ludwig's
you okay?
that's what i'd planned to
i'm going to take you to the home to see the girl
from what i've seen mr galvin you have a very good case
yes yes i think so i hope you'll be comfortable i'm putting you up at my
i made a reservation at
apartment  no no please you don't know who we're dealing with i please believe me they
what difference would
these people play very rough they don't want to lose this case there's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear i
dr thompson from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventysix
in your opinion what happened to deborah ann kaye?
yeah i guess so
cardiac arrest during delivery her heart stopped when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen you get brain damage that is why she's in the state she's in today
now dr towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes in your opinion is his estimate correct?
i didn't do too well for you
no you did fine
i'm afraid that's not true  will you want me to stay on till monday?
no no thank you doctor you go home
you know sometimes people can surprise you sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth
you sure you don't want me to stay on
are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
i in that small context i would have i would have to say 'no'
really?
then you're saying there's no negligence based on my question?
i given the limits of your question that's correct
the doctors were not negligent
they gave her the wrong anesthetic
why is that?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance she
that's what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
is that what a good doctor would do? how old are you please?
i am seventyfour years old
what the hell are you doing?
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
i am on the staff of
easthampton hospital for women excuse me what is that a joke? let me tell you something doctor those men at catherine laboure men who are known not only in this city but the world were trying to save a woman's life they were there and here you are four years later read some hospital report and say
she getting good care over there?
actually yes it's by no means bad i
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? you know what code blue means?
'code blue'
dr towler; page 406 'contraindications to general anesthetic ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic' does that sound familiar?
'practice and methodology in anaesthesia' general textbook on the subject is that correct?
i yes it is
i'm trying to slash my wrists
and you wrote that
yes
page 414 'if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask' is that what happened to deborah ann kaye? she aspirated into her mask?
she threw up in her mask yes but she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission
if she had eaten say one hour prior to admission the inducement of a general anesthetic the type you gave her would have been negligent?
negligent yes it would have been criminal but that was not the case
dr gruber
i appreciate  a man as busy as 
i read the hospital report on your client

i did
a single hour

why is that?
now have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the commonwealth a lot of time and bother
this is a complicated case your honor
i'm sure it is frank: and let me tell you something if we find it so complex how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  see my point? let's talk a minute frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
why?
you thirsty?
it's my fault he's dead because i left those drugs
my client can't walk your honor
that's it?  come on guys life is too short  you tell me if you're playing 'chicken' or you mean it  frank: i don't think i'm talking out of school but i just heard someone offer you two hundred grand and that's a lot of money and if i may say you haven't got the best of records
things change
that's true sometimes they change sometimes they don't now i remember back to when you were disbarred
i wasn't disbarred they dropped the pro
and it seems to me a fella's trying to come back he'd take this settlement and get a record for himself  i myself would take it and run like a thief
what is it?
thank you for seeing me
i need an extension for my case
you should have taken their offer especially if you were unprepared
are any of those right?
i had a witness disappear on me
that happens
i could subpoena him if i had a week
is the plaintiff ready?
ready your honor
do we have time this morning to  all right mr galvin you want to continue now or we can resume with dr thompson this afternoon
sustained yes the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records

you're all under arrest open up
jimmy  that's why the court exists the court doesn't exist to give them justice eh? but to give them a chance at justice
and are they going to get it?
they might yes that's the point is that they might you see the jury wants to believe they're all cynics sure because they want to believe i have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case i'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve and every one of them it's written on their face 'this is a sham there is no justice' but in their heart they're saying 'maybe maybe'
maybe what?

i do you want me to leave?
you do what you want you want to leave you want to go kill yourself?

who told you that?
well i have to admit my game's a little rusty but i love polo it's unrelenting a constant challenge to the senses really a beautiful experience
you told me so maybe you'd get some sympathy you came to the wrong place

dr towler
yes
you have a record of what happened in the operating room
yes that's correct
there are notations every thirty seconds
yes
of the procedures
yes the roving nurse
but those notations stop  fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kaye's
mrs?
we we were rather busy
fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped  and they resume seven minutes
as i've said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes  we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes?
we'd gone to 'code blue' we were administering electro
brain damage could have been it didn't necessarily take nine minutes it could have been caused in two
i'm separated
wait wait wait you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes?
yes
huh and why is that?
franky can't make it he had an appointment he forgot he's going to see you later i'm mickey morrissey we're supposed to get to know each other
how'm i doing so far?
stearns harrington you know who that is?
should i?
a huge law firm okay? they put him in the firm he's married everything's superb franky he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire some fuckin' place 'you must drop by with pat and me' okay?
yes
and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns harrington and he bought a dog and everything is rosy  then mr stearns he tried to fix a case
of course
i'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there could you undo a few buttons?
the big boy did?
that frank was working on yeah he thought franky needed some help so they bribed a juror so franky finds out he comes to me in tears he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint i told him 'franky wake up these people are sharks what do you think they got so rich from? doing good?' he can't be comforted he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they've disappointed him he's going to the judge to rat them out
huh
before he can get there here comes this federal marshal and franky's indicted for jury tampering they throw him in jail he's gonna be disbarred his life is over  jimmy gimme another drink  how are you?
me too
looks almost cold now don't it?
that won't start no more fires  we might's well go home
yeah  no sense stayin' out here
it's an enemy sneak attack  let's get outta here
wait a minute  wait a minute bombs don't unscrew
where'd she go?
it's no meteor that's for sure
we'd be the first to make contact with 'em  see?
we'd be in all the papers
hey how about that
hey there  open up
that explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move
madrid has just blacked out nothing more coming through
mister secretary  if they link up with those others near fresno
there's only one thing that will stop the martians  we've held back pre viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians  now there's no choice  the united nations has voted authority to the united states  the white house will confirm an order to use the atom bomb
then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles
where the hell is he?
hey you  better get outa here
i'm looking for some pacifictech professors
there's nobody left around here now
hurry up  jump in
you look kinda lost yourself
is that it over there?
did you see it come down?
yesi was fishing up in the hills
you must have caught plenty with all that tackle
oh  there were three of us  the others flew back in my plane  i don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater
what's the matter?
what's that fellow over there trying to do  dig it out?
you seem to know a lot about him
well i did a thesis on modern scien tists  working for my masters degree
did it do you any good?
why sure  i got it  do you have a match?
i'm sorry  i don't smoke
forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines  they had him on the cover of 'time'  you've got to rate to get that
aw he isn't that good
i do know himslightly
what's he like?
we'll spend an hour with "nymphos without pants"
well you certainly don't look like yourself in that getup  but i am happy to meet you anyway i'm sylvia van buren  i teach library science over at usc
i didn't know how to stop you
i might have recognized you without the beard  and you didn't wear glasses on the 'time' cover
they've all stopped at the same time
how does it happen cars are running?
the troops are certainly moving in here
didn't you have something to do with this?  i know you sent word to the sixth army command
i just told them the local situation colonel heffner's in full charge now
good to see you general  this is pastor collins director of civil defense  sheriff bogany head of the local forces  miss van buren
we can't go into town  everybody's getting out of there  i'll fly you over to pasadena
olivier's in that right?
can you handle one of these?
you'll hit something  can't you go higher?
i never noticed before  that's a cowboy tie
is that machine?
it's gone now
where are we?
i almost forget when i ate last  it looks so good you know mostly i get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants
don't you live at home?
no on the campus  i haven't any family
i come from a big one  nine of us all in minnesota except me
excuse me but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican
a big family must be funi imagine it makes you feel you belong to something
it doesmaybe that's why i feel kind of lost right now
we'll get safely out of here don't worry
but they seem to murder everything that moves
i've been as close to them as anyone but not close enough for real observation
i stayed right by the door  praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me  it was uncle matthew who found me
he liked you  i could bawl my head off
how long was i out?
nothing there now
it was  one of them
don't you love it when old friends stop by?
what was it like?
i couldn't see much in the dark  but it was one
maybe they aren't too sure we're here
they could be as curious about us as we are about them
they've blocked it
is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
yes with these suits  we've used them before on atomic tests odd looking aren't they?
very futuristic  yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut
i could wear it longer  but it's less trouble this way
my kid brother has one  you know why?
hey i'm starved let's go get something to eat we'll bring back food for everybody
yes   fits better in a football helmet
how'd you guess?
the rockies  you'd rather get back to that big family of yours in minnesota wouldn't you?
i probably wouldn't be able to get to them if i tried
you'll be all right with us  for as long as anybody's got
that's what knocked the phones out too
how could it happen to everybody's watch together?
that needle ain't pointing north
what is that gizmo?
i think that  gizmo  is a machine from another planet
i'm not really hungry
this martian blood  let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got
a forlorn hope  but there is a chance
it might give us time to search out some weakness in the martians
we know now that we can't beat their machines  but we can beat them  they are mortal beingsthe only question is whether we have time enough to do anything
gratzman  gratzman  did you get those biotics?
no  i thought you had them
i got a message for you  you're the guys from pacifictech ain't you?
right
it's about that meteor  they say it's a whopper  the district officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit thought you might be interested it's ten or twelve miles from here  over by linda rosa
are they sure it's a meteor?  it didn't come down like one
hey  i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid  i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze' at the bad guy what'd you dream about?
what the hell is that?
that's right  came down in kinda spurts didn't it?  you fellers'll have to figure it out  you're scientists  all i know  they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot
there's one  there's the other and we're right between them
so is the town i notice
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate
colonel  shooting's no good
it's always been a good persuader
general mann  i was told to expect you sir  i'm colonel heffner
that's their position?  you've certainly got them surrounded  i suppose they've neutralized all communications here
not all  radio is out  but our field phones are okay so far
we will sir
my gift to you
my orders are not to go into action unless they make a move out of there
that's because we want a chance to observe them  this is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them  what happens here will be a guide to all other operations the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops i'll get my report to washington  you've deployed your forces well
thank you sir  if they start anything we can blast them right off the earth
that probably dropped half way to pomonawhat do you think?
uncle matthewthis is dr clayton forrester  my uncle  dr matthew collins pastor of the community church
they don't do much of anything
they are living creatures out there
but they're not human  dr forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization 
let's go back inside uncle matthew
number three to donumber three to do
under the table
do to number threecome in
we're getting this under control won't need any more help  over
okay  send the tanker in but you stand by until that thing cools off over
i think somebody ought to check on it over
better'n a lion farm or a snake pit we won't have to feed it
must be somebody in there
who?  where d'you think they come from
maybe these are not men  not like us
what'll we say to 'em?
they'll understand us all right
i think you'll enjoy this table
i thought you'd killed freddy off
we did  bad mistake  the fans are clamoring for more so evil never dies right?  anyway a while back we got a call from wes  he's got this idea  and who better to resurrect freddy than his creator?

rex saved me
"as soon as the sun was up the witch made gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire  'we will bake cookies first' she said  'i have heated the oven and kneaded the dough  crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now' and she pushed gretel toward the oven the witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside"  dylan this is too violent  i don't know why you like these stupid old tales

you saw him didn't you dylan?
dylan where's the man?
whatwhat is that?
yes  it's a story  a story for a movie
you okay?
i'm fine
put it to you this way  you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula mister
everything went great i thought  we really got you didn't we?
in what a romantic comedy?
heather?  you doing okay?
holding my own  you know that guy who was calling me all the time?  he's started again  he's been putting stuff in my mail
must've read about the funeral  sick mother  that's the last thing you need right now i'm sure
darker  moreevil?
yeahhow'd you know?
anyway what i was calling about washave you seen any of the script by any chance?
wes won't show it until it's finished that's what he told me at least  i asked him at the funeral
when do you think it'll be done?
who was that?
whathappened?
i know what he's doing is bizarre but most of the time he seems so normal so well adjusted  i just can't believe it's him  i mean and not something outside influencing him  or is that how denial works?
you're not crazy by the way
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy  and jumping in
you didn't jump in
that's my memory  and it seemed absolutely real
seemed not was
it's in my family you know  my grandmother died in an institution
i've never mentioned it to him
freddy for all i know
i don't know
a man or a boy with a deep y'know freddy voice
six weeks of this and you're surprised you've got freddy in your dreams?  hell sonny bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere  even at mass
really?
absolutely  and how many times has letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  it gets under your skin if you let it
john saxon  do you have any idea what time it is?
john  it's heather  i need help
you got it  what's happening?
dylan's run away from the hospital  i don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house  but i think freddy's after him  i know it sounds crazy
you're right  that sounds crazy
holy
what's this?
i know how chase really died
what are you talking about?
fred krueger did it
heather langenkamp?
yes?
is chase porter your husband?
yes
i want to see the body
no you don't ma'am it's not necessary
studio b
how 'bout this?
hi  this is heather langenkamp
the car's no there yet?
no  ilisten i can't make it in today
i'm sorry i can't
listen dammit
yeah julie i'm sorry  i just thoughtthere was an earthquake i think  little one but
heather what is it?
i'll call the cops for you  you've got the number on the fridge right?
thanks  just give them the time he called  they're keeping a list supposedly  sorry  my nerves are so raw these days
no rex is not going to die  julie you know where the sewing stuff is don't you?
he look familiar?
no i don't think that at all  how is he?
i can tell you what the nightmares are about  they're about thisentity whatever you want to call it  it's old very old and it's taken different forms in different times  the only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for
what's that?
this is still a script we're talking about right?
then in this nightmare in progress does this thing have any weaknesses?
it can be captured sometimes
captured?  how?
like the genie in the bottle
you saying freddy's this ancient thing?
if freddy's loose i mean in your script where's he going to go?  another age?  another form?
what are you hiding?  why are you afraid
very
that's not what the dreams say he's doing
then what is he doing?
isn't there anyone that can stop him?
interestingly enough in the dreams there is one person  a gatekeeper so to speak  someone freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world  it's you heather
me?  why me?
dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense  you played nancy after all the first to humiliate and defeat him
that was nancy not me
dylan  and  chase  my god wes did you know?
heather it's just a movie a dream really
the way to stop him is to make another movie  and i swear to you i'll stay at my computer and keep writing until i finish the script  but when that time comes  you're gonna have to make a choice
now don't get into any trouble
choice?  what kind of choice?
i don't know if it has really  with the exception of one and three i've pretty much kept out of it  i'm working in television now  the hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy
now that you have a child is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
no not really  i
do you let your child watch your movies?
of course he is  freddy's dead and gone
and how about your costar in nightmare i  would you trust him alone with your child?
robert?  i
yes?
heather this is sara risher over at new line  how are you?
hey you guys
oh hi  i'm fine sara  my god a voice from the past
really  listen heather i won't take but a minute of your time  it's just that we have something to propose to you and wonder if you'd stop by the offices bob'd love to talk to you
uhsurewhen?
no time like the present  the car will bring you
now?
can i get you something to drink?
coffee'd be nice
sounds good  kim would you get heather and me a coffee?  how you like it hon?
black's fine
did we lose anybody?
how about this a trojan donkey
that low passed through last night may be a little bumpy out there
looks like weather
he would have loved this
your father?
all his years at sea he never stopped talking about these islands
i'd have liked to have said goodbye
he knows
you sound so sure
what?
do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars?
what are you going to do about it?
guilty
you may not like what you hear
i can take it
why did we begin this?
we were idealists
because we believed we could make an impact out here  self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing
i haven't forgotten
phil he's not looking inside  he's just striking out at the world
he has a lot of hurt inside him
what are they doing?
what can i do? i'm dead debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing
oh i was walkin' down lime street one day
hey  weigh  blow the man down
a pretty young maiden she happened my way
so to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale
weight  hey  blow the man down
she said "none the better you all go to hell"
everyone aboard young bill?
yes sir
we'll bear off to port and run down wind
raise the inner jib  raise the forestaysail
reach out and snort someone
why wasn't i made aware of this bill?
i didn't know sir
come in
skipper uh the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side
well that's all part of it
everyone out of the rigging now
carry on
yes sir
why didn't you drop any sail?
skipper called us out of the rigging
guess who's here? another surprise guest
but your instinct was to lose sail?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted
how old are you son?
fifteen
okay here's the duty  gieg weathers lapchick schucart: scrape and paint  corry and stricklin have the brass  robinson you're the galley slave  march you're on chain gang with barnes johnston solo on bilge detail
butler what'd i ever do to you?
it didn't go over 'til i turned her starboard
there's still a way
what do you mean?
make us proud
who?
where's mom?
i thought we'd find a store get you fixed up and then get you some lunch  that sound good?
why don't you go and try some of that on?
fine
when we were growing up i always felt like you would take care of things that everything would be okay  but you can't make this okay can you?
albatross?
yeah
rick march  who the hell are you?
gieg chuck
look meet us out front when you're through  if they try to take anything away from you like johnny quest up there just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat
debbie
what the "bowsprit affair"?
she isn't that old
what do you mean?
i walked in on my parents one time it was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and i thought that was kinda weird so i just walked in
that's what they get for not locking the door
yeah
where you going?
yeah that's right  you wanna come in and shake it for me?
if you're gonna cheat you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right
i cheated to get on the boat  all right?
she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her
my debbie?
i doctored my grades so i'd make the cut  i'm a moron okay?  you satisfied?
you're not a moron
they were gonna put me into special ed this year  i stole a copy of my transcript changed all the grades shit who am i kidding  i'll never pass the boards
bregitta  do you believe it?
believe what?
you okay?
ninetysix
congratulations
it's a ninetyone  it's an 'a'
i know
i don't know go up to her make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom
you know?  then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?
i just can't believe it
i couldn't have done it without you
feels different doesn't it?
what?
that we're going back  i don't want it to end  i don't want to be what i was when i left
what was that?
i've been getting ninetysixes my whole life  it's what they expect after all this i still haven't figured it out
figured what out?
who i am outside of this boat what the hell i'm doing here
you always were sneaky stan very sneaky
you know i never had friends like this
me either
you gonna jump?  or are you just having a last look?
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve
it's no my fault i was born first besides nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation so ease up on the sad sack stuff
it's not a vacation it's private school
i thought this was your dream come true
that's not why he's sending me
why then
i'm just not like you  ya know? i'm never going to go to yale  i'm never going to be "william"
rick marriage will be good for you it's done wonders for me
nobody says you have to be like me
he does
hey shut up will ya?
god damn it man  i think he broke my nose
yeah but how are you supposed to make the first move?
why'd you do it?
what's the difference?
you only hurt yourself you know?
can we talk?
everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father  because of you
true you're a lot handsomer now don't you have enough blood already?
well that's just typical isn't it?
is it true phil?
i gotta go
you weren't there you don't know what happened
sorry to here it
listen man i think i have a problem
we all have problems
you taking the order wouldn't have changed anything
they don't know that  we were the only one's on deck look there's nothing they can do to me right?  i'm a kid
but that's not the point
you won't miss a thing about being single the wild parties the different girls every night running around like a maniac god i miss that
honey did you know that the albatross was captured by the germans during world war ii?
no i didn't
it says she was originally schooner rigged but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine  i think square rigs look so much more romantic
do you have your ticket?
yes
passport?
goodbye mom  i'll be okay
what the hell is going on?
jesus
how ya doing?
that's an even trade a cotton ball for all my blood
fine
good
look i appreciate you know the concern and all but like he said i can take care of myself
i feel like i got you into this
forget it
i'm used to spending a lot of time alone  i guess that's what i thought it would be out here  but it's not is it?
i'm sorry i left you hanging up there
you think skipper and alice do it?
do what?
ya know "it"
nah that's okay my brother has to look up old people's asses all day long let's give him a break
no way
so what happened?
what'd you do?
my parents don't do it anymore
how do you know?  they might
where are you from any way?
depths of hell ohio  how 'bout you?
it was so real
who told you that?
my dad
thanks a lot that was the best you're next
it works?
that's how he died you know
who?
my brother  he fell out of the old beech tree  broke his neck  i was on a camp out  they started going at it throwin' things a real knock down  they didn't find him 'till the next morning  they didn't even know why he was up there
jesus you never told them?
what are they doing?
i can't go in there
hold her steady into the wind southwest by west
yes sir
ah northeast sir
nah not yet look you're my older brother i need some advice here what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
northeast sir
yes sir
you all right?
remember something sooner or later we all have to face it
uh huh
would you um say it's a big storm?
shouldn't we turn away?
what's on your mind?
well spit it out
can't do it
why not?
well the first month it's great the second month things calm down a little by the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month hopefully the football season starts
sir?
why do you think i'm sending him home?
the dolphin was a symptom
of what?
of a fight he can't win out here
i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is  what right did then have to show up here?
they have every right chuck
does phil know how you guys feel?
i don't know
chicken is a fool's game captain
oh it's er the guys from the beer convention we're bringing them to the party
so is violating international law
but you invited is aboard
stow away?
he left his passport in curacao it's being mailed to panama
why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
but the captain ordered you hard to starboard
twice
is that what you were trained to do?
no
then what do you think he was trying to do
you're late again rick
so when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training you thought he was making a mistake?
albatross?  doesn't inspire a lot of confidence
i'm francis boutillier  this is my son philip
your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until midoctober
as you can see there's a lot to do
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind
and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here
i'll be frank with you  this was his mother's idea  a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me
it will be more than that i can promise you
we'll do our best  you're welcome to say goodbye
i know sister but i have a very good excuse
well we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece
and of course we are
what is it we can do for you today?
what's wrong you don't like steak?
i should be eating with the crew
humor me  eat it anyway
spying?
i can take care of myself
oh really?
listen to me you thankless little prick  we're your parents so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully what the hell is it this captain? because i'll see him in a rowboat
there can be no excuse for tardiness
it has nothing to do with him
well what does it have to do with? us?
who is it philip?
i think you were too hard on weathers
you do?
i need to know what i'm working with; what their boundaries are their lives depend on it and for that matter so does yours  we've got to bring them together  make them a crew  we're as strong as our weakest link and i don't want to find that out the hard way  so i will challenge them and they will come together
yes sir
what?  what's happening?
you're officer of the watch george
sonofabitch
sister do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do why don't you give me a call i'm in the book
i guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be
what's that?
immortality
spirits have a way of bringing that out
and being sixteen
they're in a hurry to grow up  they don't know about consequences or responsibility  that's being sixteen too  i promise you one thing
what's that?
jesus  she's got guns
they think we're carrying cuban refugees  skipper they mean to board us
oh jesus oh jesus  man i knew we shouldn't have gone  i tried to tell you  i tried to tell you  you guys made me come  you made me come
get going rick you're late enough as it is
yeah well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't
that's enough
how the hell are we gonna get outta here?
we'll think of something
hell they even kicked me outa vo tech 'cause i couldn't read a slide rule
me too
jesus  what the hell happened to him
what's your problem?
why'd you jump?
because i felt like it  what do you care?
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
i couldn't do it
don't ever call me stupid
i'll read it  i mean i don't mind
if you've got "a broad" available i'll take her
how would you know?
trust me donut  i know
what?  come on
damn porkchop you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair
they tell you that?
it matters to me
i don't know
why man?
i don't
that's not a satisfactory answer
much have i traveled in realms of gold/ and many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ round many western islands have i been/ which bards in fealty to apollo hold/ oft of one wide expanse had i been told/ that deepbrowed homer ruled as his demesne
this isn't just a story  it's history made allegory  it is a philosophical handbook for life  it holds the secret of this very voyage
what?
the rust won't wait for you to read conrad goodall
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem mr lawford
well that was neighborly
what's wrong mr lawford
what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out
tie it off
what do you think?
we've got a problem
what's that?
terry left his passport in curacao we could hide him
if he's a cuban castro wears a dress
you gotta be kidding?  he's a human chum line
they're waving handkerchiefs or something
fuck off man  it's just a fish
you're the one who doesn't care phil
she's fucked  even if that story is true
maybe i did i don't remember
it hurts too much to care
about yourself?
how long you been standing there?
what are we supposed to talk about?
you've gotta be kidding?
but they don't speak english
phil  what are you doing?
fandango junior  i'm gonna do some limbo baby
no way phil  not like this
it's outta here
can you believe how perfect it fits?
i don't know  we gotta get 'im outta here before skipper sees him like this
you're a day late  we keep a schedule aboard ship  lives depend on it  hello philip
suicidal
do you have something to say?
no
no sir
do me a favor and tell bill once she's dogged down i want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear  lawford bill mike john and phil will stand the watch  everyone else hit the racks
i have arranged to host a good will cruise for the dutch students of the local school there
joy rapture
i'm not gonna kill it
oh these moments do try me
swing up son
what?
what's it going to be?
i'm sorry
what are you blubbering about?
don't look down  look in my eyes climb  we'll do it together
i can't
you climb damn it or so help me i'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there
are you hating this?  are you
i hate you you son of a bitch
wash it to the windows?
is it true that you forced robin weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic
he climbed when he was ready
sir were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew
no
what makes you so sure it was one?
i can't be sure
you really felt that your crew were up for the conditions
we'd come twelve thousand miles together through every kind of seas imaginable
except a "white squall"  with all due respect captain sheldrake they're only boys
they are much more than that sir
no we'll hit the son of a bitch head on
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier
for killing a dolphin
yes that's true
do you think this is funny?  some kind of joke?  you lost six people out there
yes
there are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the albatross  i have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking
i understand
how'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as francis boutillier?
it wasn't hard
i used to helm a school ship  a long time ago
it's gonna flash stevie we gotta get behind it
the families want your ticket turn it in we forget the whole thing  everybody goes home
 absolutely not
the papers are going to eat you alive  even if you beat it you'll never get another commission  they want someone to be accountable
and you didn't do anything about it?
if this young man had responded instantly to your command do you believe the ship might have been spared?
i don't know that anything could have prevented what happened
soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta"
don't mind him chucky  you're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline
easy for you to say
what's that supposed to mean?
that's franny she likes firemen
everybody knows why she went over tod  you jibed the boat
i was trying to get her up wind that's what you do when you're hit abeam  or maybe you're too stupid to know that
come in montgomery alabama
artie? that you artie?
yes ma'am what's on your almost perfect mind this evening?
how ya feelin' artie? i heard you wasn't doin' too well recent

gotta admit you guys are   two in four dozen
i forgot to show you this the gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life
i knew this would happen soon as that piece of filth got out of pee dee i knew there'd be trouble he's just got some kind of influence over her i can't decipher there's somethin' wild in lula i don't know where it comes from you gotta find 'em johnnie
he served his time for what he did another thing if lula went with him of her own volition  willingly that is  there ain't much can be done about it
i'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing i'll call marcello santos
now marietta i am goin' to help you and don't be gettin' carried away you don't want to be bringin' santos and his people into it
you're just jealous of santos cause he's sweet on me

oh johnnie farragut don't you trust your very own marietta?
ah everybody screws up some brian you're working for the toughest lt on the job saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building it's just bad luck you're family

nothin' honey  mama's just actin' strange
you ain't actin' mama
i still ain't sure what my daddy looks like
like you sweetheart you and your daddy got the same mouth eyes ears and nose only difference is your color hair is like mine
just come down john just 
my daddy ain't never killed nobody has he mama?
course he ain't never killed nobody why'd you say that pace?
heard grandpa santos and grandmama talkin'
and?
grandmama said how sailor murdered a man
why we sittin' here mama?
i'm scared mama
why honey?
case daddy don't like me what if he don't like that i don't got his color hair
hey baby
 he killed people 
hey my snakeskin jacket thanks baby did i ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
'bout fifty thousand times i got us a room at the cape fear and guess what? i hear powermad's at "the hurricane"
did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in? did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
i really did miss your mind while i was out at pee dee honey the rest of you too of course but the way your head works is god's own private mystery what was it you was thinkin'?
well i was thinkin' about smokin' actually my mama smokes marlboros now used to be she smoked kools? i stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade when i got old enough to buy my own i bought those now i've just about settled on mores as you probably noticed? they're longer
i guess i started smokin' when i was about six my mama was already dead from lung cancer
what brand'd she smoke?
camels same as me guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness
gee sailor i'm sorry honey i never would have guessed it
it's okay i hardly used to see them anyway i didn't have much parental guiding the public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin' he was a good ol' boy stood by me even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time
 you know what swayzak would do to the department if this got out? 
i'd stand by you sailor through anything
you're perfect for me too
you remind me of my daddy you know? mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies he had a long nose too like theirs did i ever tell you how he died?
in a fire as i recall
you have such a pretty long neck like a swan
sailor you are somethin' else honey when i was fifteen mama told me that pretty soon i'd be startin' to think about sex and i should talk to her before i did anything about it
but honey i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen
that's true uncle pooch wasn't really an uncle he was a business partner of my daddy's? and my mama never knew nothin' about me and him  that's for damn sure his real name was somethin' kind of european like pucinski but everyone just called him pooch he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away i always figured he was sweet on mama so when he cornered me one afternoon i was surprised more'n a little
you're terrible crude sometimes sailor you know?
i said you can be too crude sometimes? i don't think i care for it
 stephen this is bullshit 
sorry sugar go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed
uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch you know? where i was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin' that night with vicki and cherry ann the desoto sisters uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter
so how'd he finally nail you? right there in the kitchen?
he was short but powerful with hairy arms? anyway he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used we did it there on an old bed
'we' did it? whattaya mean? didn't he force you?
well sure but he was supergentle you know? i mean he raped me and all but i guess there's all different kinds of rapes i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didn't seem all that terrible it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich
and you never told nobody about it?
just you uncle pooch never acted strange or different after and he never did anything else to me i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry?
one hundred twenty decibels  head on collision of a '54 ford pickup and a '64 chevy station wagon no survivors balls of flame and grinding metal
uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in myrtle beach they still got way too much traffic there for my taste and another thing baby that government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space
yeah
it doesn't go like that
here she goes again
you okay honey?
that woman's laugh creeps me out i heard somethin' like that somewhere before sound'd like the wicked witch
just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me you ready to dance?
hell you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all
what you want to watch this trash for? ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain
that so?  you want to tell me what if any real thoughts you had lately?
what's that honey?
i'm sorry sweetie i forget some moments where all you been the last two years
twentythree months eighteen days is all don't need to make more'n it was  this couple's goin' on a date to hawaii the girl chose him over the other two guys
who asked you?
don't the reject guys get anythin'?
gift certificates to kentucky fried chicken
that don't seem fair
sailor?
yeah?
wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
you think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes peanut ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
oh you know exactly what i mean honey? it'd make the future so simple and nice
at pee dee all you think about is the future you know? gettin' out? and what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again
i just think about things as they come up i never been much of a planner
well look what we have here nice costume rent it?
musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time what did you do your mama find out?
i hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars not countin' what it cost us to get here and back this man's the best damn abortionist in the south
you tell the boy who knocked you up?
it was my cousin dell done it? his folks used to visit with us summers
what happened to him?
oh nothin' i never let on to mama about dell bein' the one i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? i didn't tell dell neither he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i didn't see the point somethin' terrible happened to him though six months ago
what's that peanut?
actin' funny how?
one time aunt rootie caught dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
hell peanut
i want to thank you for coming to my graduation stephen it was a great inspiration to me
are followin' him around
prob'ly the rain boys from outer space
the private eye cost aunt rootie over a thousand dollars? then a little while later dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind" nobody's seen him since
sound like ol' dell's more'n just a little confused peanut too bad he couldn't visit that ol' wizard of oz and get some good advice
too bad we all can't baby one thing about dell?
what's that?
when he was about seventeen he startin' losin' his hair
so?
he's twentyfour now? a year older than you? and must be 'bout bald
there's worse things that can happen to a man honey
doesn't work on you  see ya around little brother
let's go dancin' peanut i'm ready
we gotta be careful honey my mama's gonna have johnnie farragut on us like a duck on a june bug and he's one clever detective? you know how clever? he once told me that he could find an honest man in washington my toenails gotta dry first anyways sailor
one thing puzzles my mind sugar you're twenty years old  aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? puttin' a detective on us i'll tell ya lula well it's more'n me killin' bob ray lemon
maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much
sailor
you up for that?
i'd got to the far end of the world for you baby you know i would
that's an awful long way to go just to get some pussy
yeah i had my first taste on that trip to juarez at that age you still got a lot of energy
sorry baby when's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
not likely
she looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm  told me her name was irma
what'd you say to her?
when she got almost to the top step i stuck my hand between her legs from behind
oh baby what a bad boy you are
that's just what she said i had a boner with a capital "o" i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway i found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines she was a wild chick she was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides you know them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
you mean like pedal pushers?
she just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air i slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it
you're excitin' me honey what'd she do?
her face was halfpushed into the pillow and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said 'i won't suck you don't ask me to suck you'
poor baby she don't know what she missed what color hair she have?
i like what you've done with the place
i'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere i mean i don't want her to worry no more'n necessary
what do you mean by necessary? she's prob'ly already called the cops my parole officer her pi boyfriend johnnie farragut
i suppose so she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung but i don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this i guess this means you're breakin' parole then?
you guess? my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt portagee county
what'll it be like in california sailor do you think? i hear it don't rain much there
you got about six more big states to go before we find out
that don't smell like a more
it ain't it's part of the lessons of life i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape?
they sure do stink
yeah i guess but  and here's the lesson part  they ain't supposed to be so bad for you
been ripping off fire stations?
you ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour are you sugar? i mean here you are crossin' state lines with a anumber one certified murderer
manslaughterer honey not murderer don't exaggerate
okay manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned
life is a bitch and then you marry one
what kinda trash talk is that?
what it says on the bumper sticker up front on that pickup
that's disgustin' those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public is this biloxi yet?
almost i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat
got anyplace special in mind?
how about that one? the host of the old south hotel
my god an actual operating 8track
i hate hotel bedspreads they don't hardly never get washed and i don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt
come look at this
what's that honey?
there ain't no water in the swimmin' pool just a dead tree fell in prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'
it's huge this musta been a grand old place at one time
mississippi you can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big no
lula i learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show i heard on the radio how leeches is comin' back into style
got you a pack of mores again huh?
yeah it's a real problem for me sailor you know? when i went in that drugstore by the restaurant in biloxi? i saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in i'm not big on resistin' so what about a leech?
heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again just in old times you know when even barbers used 'em?
what you've never seen one before?
yeah well listen to this radio said back in the 1920s a italian doctor figured out that if say a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in say a barfight or somethin' they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks then put leeches on it
sailor? you expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
sailor ripley you stop you're makin' this shit up and i ain't gonna sit for it
honest lula i prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight but it's about what they said
we're about dry bones sweetheart we don't wanna have to push this "bird" into new orleans
i love it when your eyes get wild honey they light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em oh sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? i mean you pay attention and i swear you got the sweetest cock sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? like it's got a voice all it's own you get right on me
what lesson do get outta that story lula?
it's just another case sailor
what's that peanut?
huh?
what would your girlfriend think of that?
in the field museum once
ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? sometimes i think it would be the biggest thrill?
my god  it better be darlin' cause it'd be the last what time is it?
lula sometimes i gotta admit you come up with some weird thoughts
anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts sailor you tell me sailor who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
you got me peanut
you certain?
i ain't never met anyone come close to you sugar
recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the confederate soldier? leanin' against it and you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said 'you feel it beatin' in there lula? get used to it 'cause it belongs to you now' d'you recall that?
i do
i really do think it's the best night of my life
it works
we didn't do nothin' special i can remember just talked is all
talkin's good long as you got the other? i'm a big believer in talkin' case you ain't noticed
too bad they don't give an award for talkin' you'd win first prize especially with those tits
you think so baby? does my talkin' bother you honey?
no i like gettin' up around four am and talkin' bout wild animals though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream i kinda wish i didn't remember it up at pee dee i couldn't remember any of my dreams
what was this one?
the water was rollin' off me and i was dirty too like i hadn't had no bath in a long time so the sweat was black almost
boy sweetie this is weird okay
i know i kept walkin' i headed for your house only it wasn't your house really you let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me you kept askin' 'why'd you come to see me now? why now?' like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other
oh baby what an idea i'd always be happy to see you no matter what
people actually used to pay you for this?
sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin' stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over you know? anyways dreams ain't no odder than real life sometimes not by half
let's get outta here i suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place feelin' all that voodoo

why'd you come here brian?
you know lula i never told you what all i was doin' before i met you
i just figured you was out bein' mr cool
not exactly sugar one reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what i was doin' i tried to tell you this before
you're scarin' me baby
well there's a good side as well as a bad side to it the good side is i knew your daddy and i thought clyde was a good ol' guy
you knew my daddy?
yes i did i sure did the bad side of it is i did some drivin' for a man named marcello santos
oh shit
i quit workin' for 'im but just before i did i ended up one night at a house i don't know what it is they all think i saw that night but i was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames
god sailor that's the night my daddy died
i wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment i mean is this really gonna have to one of those big brother  little brother "you broke my gi joe and i'm still pissed" games?
i know sugar but while the place was burnin' before santos came out  i pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin' afterwards when i met you i always liked to think i mighta saved your life
that's some big secret you been carryin' sailor

live in exchange for sexual favors police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls all asians twelve to fifteen years old who have been living in the north houston warehouse with a vietnamese pimp since february the girls are being treated as victims said police sergeant amos milburn 'these are really just children' he said 'but they've been exposed to a lot already
i'll bet
the reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species said a senior government official but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles
damn
in the ganges near varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by hindus too poor to pay for cremation

yes
but where in the head? not the chin i hope
no in the brains what little i'm sure he has
you want me to shoot sailor in the brains with a gun

yes
wrong it's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head right toward the bridge of the nose lots and lots of irreparable damage
see i knew you had it all under control
hey
why didn't you send johnnie farragut?
maybe i did try new orleans first lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town
you give me your permission to kill johnnie farragut
santos no please santos
you're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?

i'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"
santos i can't

you fucker don't you ever touch lula  you fucker i'll kill you
so you got a 'roid going with jackson or what?
put your shoulders back

that's just another part of the price to pay
i got your message but you went right to johnnie didn't you? i can't trust you bitch  not for one minute naughty girl sailor and lula are headed west and guess what? there's no turning back i'm in a killing mood
no

sailor ripley can i talk to lula?
there's no way in hell you can speak to her and

whattya mean?
well johnnie told me you used to drive for clyde and santos
jesus it's too damn bright in here like a goddamn spotlight i'm goin' blind
so?
so maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire and you're gonna get burned baby and besides that you're shit d'you think i'd let my little girl go with shit like you? why you belong right here in one of these toilets
you're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from lula
oh don't worry 'bout that
oh look at this what do you want snakeskin?
just passin' through on my way to who knows where
sure i figured i'd see you sometime
hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me i really need to know
by who?
i think santos or marietta fortune
this?
heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter
you heard right
you really are one dumb asshole
life is unpredictable
does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and santos killed her daddy?  does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around  till he started snortin' the shit himself?  does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
i didn't see nothin'
yeah but i did and i told you all about it
is there a contract? we made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard
i know i remember
well?
i'm serious here
roll the hose
i ain't heard of nothin'
i'll tell you the problem you behind the wheel there's your fucking problem
that's pretty simplistic don't you think?
hey pal you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens
excuse me did you or did you not have a gun to his head?
what he means is it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes it lives in the mind
that's just how my brain works i guess
fascinating listen why don't you come out with us after the lecture there's a place on the hill i always get trip to take me
actually i just want to go home
he's fine he's narrating
what is it the stairs? christ i'll let you win next time
hey what are you guys doing here?
i like what you've done with it when's captain nemo moving in?
you all right professor tripp?
he's great come on let's blow before lo' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast
oh well that's just it she's been coming down here every half hour or so to sort of check on me if i'm not here she might call the police or something
hhhuh so we decoy her stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference
you snore
so i hear
no offense professor tripp but you look sorta crappy
it's the chancellor
you got a problem with drilling probie?
thank you
tripp
how are you crabtree?
i was explaining to antonia how a book comes to be published what you do as a writer what i do as an editor
emily?
your wife
oh we're picking her up downtown
do you know how many times i've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? particularly while i'm on my way to pittsburgh
lay off pittsburgh it's one of the great cities
if it can produce a miss sloviak you'll get no argument from me
no lt i don't have a problem with drilling but let's just have one drill not one for the company and one for me
she's a transvestite
you're stoned
she's still a transvestite
mm
it's fine it's done basically i'm just sort of tinkering with it
great i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend think that might be possible?
i don't know i'm sort of at a critical juncture
i thought you were tinkering
i just mean
you didn't actually purchase this car did you trip??
ready?
it was jerry nathan's he owed me money
he said something about being between things
trip??
she left me crabs
left you? who? emily?
this morning i found a note in the kitchen
i thought you were mrs gaskell's hobby tripp
piss off crabs i lost a wife today
is that just beer?
primarily although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia you missed a few bottles by the way
christ stephen let's wait for the hose team
i'm sure where is everyone?
he has a book
i know he started it fall semester
so is he any good?
no not yet he isn't
well i'm going to read it anyway
come on crabs don't do this he's one of my students for christ sake i'm not even sure if he's 
he is take my word for it
i think it's more complicated than that besides he's a little scattered he almost did something stupid tonight at least i think so anyway he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now
no sexual confusion there eh professor?
you okay?
he's a boxer a flyweight
huh uh a jockey his name's um curtis curtis hardapple
not curtis
vernon then vernon hardapple the scar's are from a  from a horse he fell during a race and got trampled
and now he's addicted to painkillers
he can't piss standing up anymore
he lives with his mother
and he had a younger brother who was a
groom named claudell and his mother blames vernon for his death
that was good
i waited i would have fucking waited
christ crabs what do you expect me to do? the kid's practically in a coma
tripp
yes
what's this guy's problem?
shit
wait here i'll be right back
tripp?
listen hannah i'm flattered really but right now i 
you stay there
honestly tripp do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
that's not what it's about brian the point is there was a kid in there and what if there'd been two? i went in because that's what i do it's my way it's dad's way it isn't everybody's way
gee i don't know crabs i don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room
sometimes we have to improvise
think hannah does james have any friends i mean besides you and me?
james? my james? what's happened?
nothing he's just been sort of i don't know kidnapped
kidnapped? by who?
his parents
good god let's go rescue him
good idea crabs only one problem i don't know where they live
ah wait a minute the university must know where he lives
dad's way? where did he tell you that? in a fucking seance?
it's a little late to call admissions
is it a little late to call the chancellor?
you know  based on what i've read  this is a very exciting piece of material this big parade
love it's love parade  and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? you skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines
i've been doing this a long time tripp i feel this kid in my bones
how bad is it for you?
bad enough and god knows i don't exactly fit the new corporate profile
which is?
so tell me about you and the chancellor
what's to tell?
so am i
look you are sorta making yourself fair game
jesus there must be two dozen windows on that thing how are we supposed to find his?
oh christ don't start on ol' gran or we'll leave you here
so modest
so sensitive
oh come on tripp cut the kid some slack
it's just ail that crap he spins out just once i'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth
crabtree
is he awake?
i'm afraid he's pretty worn out poor kid
shut up james
thanks for the insight
so what's the problem?
who do you think it is?
the chancellor's here? now?
i want to publish this i've got to i think they'll let me with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant
so  what do we do now?
find the jacket
oh huh exactly how do we do that?
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car
want some help with that?
let me get this straight jerry nathan owes you money so as collateral he gives you his car
brian look 
only now i'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly jerry's to give
so whose car is it?
my guess  vernon hardapple
the hood jumper?
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his
such as
'that's my car motherfucker'
uh huh so we find vernon we find the car we find the car
we find the jacket
there's only one problem tripp we don't know his real name we just made it up in fact we made the whole guy up
not now brian
christ tripp how did you know?
naturally you have copies
i have an alternate version of the first chapter
you'll be all right then look at carlyle when he lost his luggage
that was maccaulay
or hemingway when hadley lost all those stories
he was never able to reproduce them
kind of a sign you're saying
in a sense
the jacket tripp we need the jacket
had to take on another fire bare handed huh? had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie is that what happened? is it stephen?
came to my senses
ah well congratulations meanwhile what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?
walter gaskell isn't going to send james leer to jail crabs i know that
do you know he won't expel him?
no but i don't think that matters
me? what can i do?
you peeked didn't you?
how are you  is it joe?
jeff sorry i didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago
don't sweat it well 'night jeff
i had that fire he didn't listen
oh professor tripp? you know last semester what i said that time in office hours  i hope there's no hard feelings
no
i mean i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and  well  i was pretty bent in general
it's cool jeff really
i'll be somewhere else
you driving this car?
excuse me?
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500 you driving this car?
it's mine
bullshit it's mine motherfucker
he didn't listen? he was a fucking candidate he was your responsibility he shouldn't have been there in the first place stephen  you burned him
you must be mistaken
i passed out
you did
i've been doing that a lot lately
so i hear you've also been smoking a lot of marijuana i understand
do you think that's why i've been having these  spells?
how long have you been having them?
the last month maybe
how long have you been smoking marijuana?
spiro t agnew was vice president i believe
hey what are you doing here?
that's probably not the problem then what about your lifestyle any major changes recently?
i've been trying to finish a book
and your wife left you
is that in my chart?
i know
you need to see a doctor mr tripp an internist and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist as well
she told you about
her dog yes
look mr tripp you have a drug problem all right? on top of that you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected we pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine but another day or two and you might have lost the foot as for your spells i'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately
they're anxiety attacks? that's a little disappointing
just just wanted to say hello
better luck next time
so is my friend is sara still here?
no there's no one here
vernon
move away cupcake he's got a gun
who's got a gun?
you've got a gun motherfucker drop it
not true you're the only vernon i know actually i'm wrong i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin uk
it's just a souvenir they don't even make the caps anymore
bullshit i know a gun when i see one and that's a gun
well long as you're here you can help clean up a little i've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes
who the hell is that?
let me get this straight all that paper that went into the river that was the only copy?
'fraid so
hey vernon can i ask you a question?
boy or girl?
right well thanks for the lift
no sweat only do me a favor?
sure
hello?
grady it's sara thank god you're there you won't believe what's happened
c'mon  you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity  she sees me differently
you're selling dad's boat?
sara? hi it's grady
where are you grady? an elevator?
i'm in kinship listen sara there's some things we need to talk about
you're in kinship?
yes but that's not why i called
with emily?
what? no there's no one here i'm just just
reconcile with emily
goodbye grady
no sara you don't understand
yeah it's just another memory in my life right now and i got way too many of them
trust me i understand i just want to say something to you grady
yea?
it was my mother's she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school
it's very convincing
it's just for good luck some people carry rabbits' feet
are you and hannah seeing each other james?
no what gave you that idea?
relax james i'm not her father i just rent her a room
she likes old movies like i do that's all  besides she doesn't really know me she thinks she does but she doesn't maybe it's because she's mormon and i'm catholic
you're not like my other teachers professor tripp
i really should get back there's there's something i'm supposed to do
you're not like my other students james so what was the movie you two saw?
huh? oh son of fury with tyrone power and frances farmer
she went crazy frances farmer
so did gene tierney she's in it too
sounds like a good one
listen james about this afternoon in workshop i'm sorry i think i let things get a bit out of control
they really hated it i think they hated it more than any of the other ones
well
it doesn't matter it only took me an hour to write
really? that's remarkable
yeah? what have you got to do?  look at you look at your face all the things you must be thinking man you must really hate my guts well you know what? it's okay
you cold james?
a little
so what are you doing out here?
it's colder in there
actually i saw the greenhouse so i thought i thought i'd come out here and take a look at it you don't see one of those every day it looks like heaven
heaven?
james  don't leave just yet there's something i think you ought to see
i'll miss my bus
is that really it?
that's really it
look stephen maybe we can talk about this some other 
the one she wore on her wedding day?
go ahead
really?
they're glass the buttons
it's feels unreal like butterfly wings or something it must've cost dr gaskell a lot
i guess walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things
pretty good i'm friends with dr gaskell too
i guess you must be if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this
i'm sorry professor tripp maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her it just looks really lonely hanging there in a closet maybe i'm just a little sad
maybe i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight
it's okay stephen i 
you mean with your wife leaving you and all?  hannah mentioned something about it about a note
shit james you shot dr gaskell's dog
i had to didn't i?
couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
no he was crazy i didn't  he looked  i thought 
do you have a mirror? it's the best way to see if someone's breathing
professor tripp? can i ask you a question?
yea james
i don't know i'm still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband's dog
you?
i saw it
trust me james when the family pet's been assassinated the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman
does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
that's a big trunk it fits a tuba a suitcase a dead dog and a garment bag almost perfectly
that's just what they used to say in the ads come on crabtree i know you're holding
whose tuba is that anyway?
miss sloviak's
can i ask you something about her?
oh so is  is your friend crabtree  is he  gay?
looks like our old friend mr codeine that should take the pinch out of my ankle  have one
no thanks i'm fine without them
saw what?
this is so embarrassing you guys had to carry me out
mmhmmm knap sap
shit he must've left it back at thaw in the auditorium
thank you
i'm okay i just lost my balance
i put you on the floor
oh
huh? oh no this isn't emily's i just write in it
i guess there's probably a story behind that
want me to get that?
when dad died i saw another fire
he didn't give his name
who?
the guy on the phone
what'd he say?
he wanted to know if a grady tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 ford galaxie 500 with black interior
what'd you tell him?
yes
good james if the zodiac killer calls be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right
afraid so
that's a big book you're writing
everybody did
i think it's sort of writing itself at this point
wow hannah always swore you were working but 
but ?
nothing it's just that well it's been awhile since arsonist's daughter and some people  some of the kids in workshop  thought maybe you were
washed up?
blocked
professor tripp?
hm
how did i get here last night?
no one seems to know where you live james hannah thought you'd like my couch
you're her savior?  is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
i saw it before it got them i tried to yell but he asked me to look out for him and i didn't do it i let him die
and and before that did i do anything? anything bad?
how's that?
i got kicked out well not exactly kicked out i was asked to leave
i guess there's probably a story behind that
there is but it's not that interesting
so where have you been staying?
it's not so bad i know the night janitor and there's a broken locker i can put my stuff
but james i mean how long?
a couple weeks that's why that's why i had the gun for protection
jesus james you should've told someone
jesus you been carrying that around for twenty years? for christ's sake you were seven years old you think he could have heard you in there?
who?
isn't this?
i can't help myself i don't know what's the matter with me
she seemed to take it pretty well
don't be proud james we're in sewickley heights we could find you a nice golf course to barf on
i've got a thing about places like this i know what those houses are like i know what the people are like
humboldt county?
maybe
it's my father he gets it from his doctor
glaucoma?
i hate him so much sometimes stephen you don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on
colon cancer
it's a bit of a scandal my parents live in a small town
where's that?
carvel
carvel? where's carvel?
outside scranton
i never heard of it
it's a hellhole three motels and a mannequin factory my dad worked there for thirtyfive years
your father worked in a mannequin factory?
seitz plastics that's where he met my mom she was a fry cook in the cafeteria before that she'd been a dancer
maybe i do  what a fuckin' mess huh?  people can change brian
what kind of dancer?
whatever kind they wanted her to be
james leer are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
i'm telling you what i was told by my uncle and he should know he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt
didn't you say your mom went to catholic school?
when we fall we fall hard
i thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions
this is so nice it's like where andy hardy would live what's it called again?
kinship
kinship and what's here?
oh god stephen what's going on with you?
the one that left you?
someone jumped on your car with their butt
how can you tell?
want one they're incredible incredible
maybe she didn't come here
relax emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old and your hips are as slim as hers
it's not that it just reminded me of  you know  of what's in the car in the trunk
it feels really good here
i just wanted a little sip
i just wanted a little sip? tell me james exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy?
 stephen wait a minute i gotta talk to you it's adcox he's 
jesus  look james you appear to possess  like many an aspiring writer before you by the way  a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made however i think it's best if for the moment at least  we abstain
you're mad at me aren't you?
what?
you're mad because i shot your girlfriend's dog
okay james i wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog even though poe and i weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico that's no reason for him to take two in the chest still the fact remains that i'm the one who took you up into the chancellor's bedroom i'm the one who has to take the blame i don't know what the hell i was thinking
sure you do you were thinking: 'that's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat' you were thinking 'i can't let that kid get on the bus alone  he might never get on the bus again' you were thinking: 'i've got to find a way to distract this kid' so you did it was  in its way  a noble act
so why did you take me up there?
it's warm
that's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop
because of my coat?
 what are you doing here?
because you act like a goddamn spook all the time not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you
jealous? of me?
you're lying
the hell i am
yes you are my stuff stinks i know it you said so yourself
i never said that
yes you did last night to your friend crabtree "is he any good?" he said and you said: "not yet he isn't" i heard you myself
i didn't mean it that way
it's okay professor tripp carrie howard the others  they're right my stories are annoying they go on and on and on and the longer they go on the more annoying they become until finally you just want to grab something heavy and 
but last night
i saw adcox's back i saw the burn i put it there jesus christ stephen he's been killing people
who cares what i said last night james i  i was drunk i was stoned i'd been bitten by a dog my wife had left me how 'bout cutting me some slack?
i'm sorry
let me spell it out for you james books don't mean anything not to anybody not anymore
you coming?
want a bite?
no thanks
that's why you're having them your spells
spells? jesus james you make it sound like we're in a tennessee williams play i don't have spells
what would you call them then?
it's because you don't eat
i know
i eat
when?
you just worry about yourself james okay?
where you going?
i'm not going with them
james listen things  things are a little weird with me right now and i  well i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you and if you hang around me long enough something bad is going to happen trust me that's why i need you to go home understand?
i'm not going with them
james like it or not they're your parents
i remember that five or six years ago
six their plane went down right outside scranton
how do you know?
near carvel?
get out of here
that's why she hates me that's why she makes me sleep in the basement
can i  i mean  do you mind  if i wear this again professor tripp?
and we both thank you for that but we're we're fine
does she mean  does she know about her dog?
don't worry james i'll figure something out
i'm not worried you're not worried are you professor tripp?
i'm a little worried james
don't be i don't care if they expel me i probably should be expelled
but you hate joey
okay tell you what i'll give you a head start  you take her to the station house  don't let her out of your sight she's the only warm body we got left
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals looking for me
professor tripp?
yes james
yes hannah?
thanks for that he all right?
i think so what about you?
me? sure why?
he's going with me you take crabtree and his friend all right?
ail right by the way his friend?
james this is my editor terry crabtree
i've been rereading arsonist's daughter it's so beautiful grady so natural it's like all your sentences always existed just waiting around in style heaven or wherever for you to fetch them down
 what were they doing there?
i thank you
and i love the inscription you wrote to me only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am
so what are you going to do?
do?
look hannah when you get him home make sure he's all right before you leave okay?
i would if i knew where i was taking him
hannah are you telling me you don't know where james leer lives?
some apartment somewhere but i've never seen it
that strikes me as odd
his bag you know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around he must've left it inside
anything else?
all right take him to my place he can crash on the sofa
the one in your office? it's the best one for naps
i thought we were going to talk last night
hey
i know i shouldn't have but there it was just sort of lying out and i couldn't resist and  and  i suck
no it's okay i just can't believe i left it out in the open like that crabtree hasn't been in here has he? poking around?
listen hannah you don't remember where that aunt worked do you? james' aunt
he shot the chancellor's dog didn't he? the blind one
actually he's not the chancellor's  what?
at first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon dr gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet 
what are we going to do about this?
jesus
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in
crabtree? he doesn't even know james
the aunt hannah where did you take james that day?
i told you sewickly heights
but where? i need the street
he cribbed that from borges
right anyway i was wondering if i could borrow your car mine's sort of out of commission
i uh i didn't finish i fell asleep
that good huh?
i'll handle it
it's just that you know i was thinking about how in class you're always telling us 'that writers make choices  at least the good ones and don't get me wrong i'm not saying the book isn't really great  i mean really great  but at times it's well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on  and i don't know maybe i'm wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like  you didn't make any choices at all and i was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you weren't always under the influence
professor tripp
chancellor
i got the message you called
easy there
i need to talk to you
that's funny i need to talk to you too  perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room professor tripp
i don't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is
new?
you go first
we gotta go to rimgale stephen
all right this morning 
i'm sure
well this is surprising does walter?
emily left me this morning
she's left before
so i guess we just divorce our spouses marry each other and have this baby right? simple
is that cristaile?
hm
my god i wear the same scent as a transvestite she is a transvestite isn't: she?
if she's not now terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening
you're his lt stephen  are you gonna handle it? are you stephen?

you crazy son of a bitch why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
no really sara i don't think you 
you love emily i know that and you need to stay with her
i don't think i really have a choice in that emily left me
not have it
no there's no way i mean don't you think there's no way?
well no i don't see any way  and i know how hard it is for you to  to lose this chance
who's gun is that?
heavy smells like gunpowder
pow
you got me
"you never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be "
i can't believe you hung up on me you dick
walter's on campus being the good soldier for wordfest but he's a basket case someone stole marilyn's jacket last night and poe's missing too
i heard
you heard? how?
a twelveyearold policeman came by the house this morning
your fingerprints were all over the bedroom
really? that was fast
i'm kidding hello?
oh right ha listen about last night there is something i need to tell
are you limping? why are you limping?
don't tell them about adcox don't let 'em
hub? oh well that's part of what i need to
did you pass out again grady? did you fall somewhere?
no i mean well actually yes sort of i don't remember listen sara i have to tell you something
gee grady that sounded so heartfelt i don't know whether to swoon or smirk
i believe you i believe you want to be with me but this is not just about me anymore
i know that i know what's at stake here
no i don't think you do and besides i haven't decided yet
about the baby
who's that sitting in your car?
james leer
hey  i'm a professional
brian
what's he doing out there?
sara
oh?
it seems one of our students is  missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed
i'm not very happy with you right now grady but more importantly walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this you wouldn't happen to know where james is would you grady?
inside
and the jacket?
someone stole my car
grady
honestly someone stole my car i parked it right there last night
jennifer
are you sure you parked it there?
this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education grady
would walter really press charges?
you didn't happen to call the house last night did you grady?
i think i might have
and what do you think you might have said?
he told you
he told me
and what did you say?
i'm so glad to see you sara
you're back
i believe you did that nice doctor let you out? or is this you improvising again grady?
i'm through improvising
terry told me about wonder boys is it true? did you lose it all?
i lost it all
oh grady you're such a putz
i know
ouch how many?
i went and looked at some babies just now
oh?
i guess you have to go on faith
you look great
did you tell walter?
i told walter
does he still love you?
did you just make that up?
you don't deserve me you know
the more the merrier
that perfume you're wearing antonia it wouldn't happen to be cristaile would it?
why yes how did you know?
that's a nice greenhouse
who's he barking at now?
thanks for calling
i need a ride
couldn't he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
james is i don't know
disturbed and when your friend crabtree gets done with him he's going to be even more disturbed
i'm not sure that's possible
listen antonia 
tony now that i'm home
tony i'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight with terry
he's writing his name in water
what's that?
uh i've been sorta keeping a low profile the academy i graduated today
like most editors he really wants to be a writer but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit
you mean because his career's ruined and all?
jesus is that what he told you?
that's nice all we have is a japanese beetle trap
walter?
who's this ?
it's grady walter
grady?

what made you pull out that old thing?
i was thinking of you
and?
it's no arsonist's daughter but i guess you know that it's a young man's book it got me remembering how it felt to be young
maybe i should read it
where's emily hank?
i don't know if she'd want me to tell you that grady
where you stand?
yeah? what have you been up to?
i  just want to say i'm sorry

one other thing about this kid this student of yours  leer  james leer you wouldn't know how i could get in touch with him would you?
i might have his number on campus

there's so many
pier angeli 1971 or '72 also pills charles boyer 1978 pills again charles butterworth 1946 i think in a car supposedly it was an accident but you know  he was distraught dorothy dandridge she took pills in like 1965 albert dekker 1968 he hung himself he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach alan ladd '64 more pills carole landis pills again i forget when george reeves superman on tv shot himself jean seberg pills of course 1979 everett sioane  he was good  pills margaret sullavan pills lupe velez a lot of pills gig young he shot himself and his wife in 1978 there are more but i don't know if you would have heard of them ross alexander? clara blandick? maggie mcnamara? gia scaia?

one hundred and twenty feet
what?
law says i can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate i figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty make a bet?

i should go your sister worries and when she worries she yells
when i was twenty
how is she?
annette? she's good tense
when can i see her?
i'm working on it
is it because of anna?
i don't know she won't talk about it
you're the only one in the family who still talks to me

how old is anna?
she'll be twelve next week we're throwing a big party on saturday wish i could ask you to come

carrying swayzak's notebook?
it wasn't like that

isn't it?
the important thing is that you and annette need to talk she needs to see you and you need to see her
i'm not a monster
you're a good man walter okay you did some wrong things but inside you're a good decent man
maybe i'm not a good man maybe inside i'm bad and i'll always be bad
i get horny as hell for other women  i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman
you don't have to tell me this
why do you think marty came here tonight? because he cares about your department you don't know how hard he works you don't know about his programs helping west side 
i'm just talking man
carlos i never raped a woman
it's crazy out there  young girls wearing mini this and mini that sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman she makes me feel like i'm bothering her she stares down like she's afraid to look at me why she do that? why can't she look me in the face?
carlos can i ask you something?
sure
nothing
ask me ask me anything
what do you mean?
what are you looking at?
birds
well you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn'tincluding me
 all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
there's a million birds here
there's little chicks  you want to see?
they're starlings
is that right?
i don't like starlings
why not?
they're extremely aggressive birds plus their habits are rather filthy
you always carry these?
when i go birdwatching it's why i like coming here
it's just a city park
what was that? oh man you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard
you'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here last week i saw a purple martin and the week before that i saw a solitary vireo that's rare
a solitary vireo i like that one
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound?
it's hard to describe
try
i can't
i'd love to hear it
something like that
that was terrific
yeah well i like to think i'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters
you should hear the bird
you live around here?
not too far  are you a birdwatcher too?
me? nah i'm more of a people watcher
were you watching me?
not at first you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently any second i thought you would take off and fly
i have to go
do you come here often?
my daddy likes me home before dark
see anything interesting?
boy took you all of thirty seconds to blow that
what are you writing in that book?
don't you have friends?
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
i'm not pretty
what does that mean?
you tell me your name i'll tell you mine
hiya walter

brian do you always have to be so stupid? think about your future for once
it's not for sale
and when you sit by the window watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by do you wave your wanger at the girls? is that when you jerk off?
you can't talk to me like 
okay?
too much sun
your ivy too much direct sunlight these plants don't like a lot of sun
they grow outside don't they?
sure they do but outside they've got trees around them the trees shade them from the sun of course the plants enrich the soil around the trees one of nature's symbiotic relationships
you going to take me on a nature walk?
don't be witty  yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work but instead of getting off at your normal stop for some reason you stayed on why did you stay on the bus walter?
so now you suddenly care about my future?
you walked home
this one guy on death row who i'll call henry told me about his last victim henry says how he's in the bedroom of a sevenyearold cutie named adele her mother's in the living room watching tv she's got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman's jokes henry puts his hand over adele's mouth and says "if you scream little girl i'll kill your mother" and of course little adele doesn't scream doesn't cry doesn't make a sound then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door  ten days later they find adele's body or what's left of it  you believe in fairy tales?
fairy tales?
do you believe in them?
no
neither do i  what's the one with the woodsman?
woodsman?
the one with the ax?
i don't know
sure you do he cuts open the wolf's stomach and the girl steps out alive
look i didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there i just thought you'd call when you came back you didn't and  don't blow it just because of this garbage between us
little red riding hood
you knew her?
what?
you don't know?
know what?
i'll be asking the questions  last night you hear anything unusual? screams? shouts?
no
a man was badly beaten across the street you know anything about that?
i was asleep
i didn't say what time the assault occurred
i've been thinking about what you said the other night if the offer's still on the table i'd like to talk about it
you said last night i went to bed pretty early
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i wasn't feeling well
i could take you downtown
he id'd the assailant the description matches you pretty well
i suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty medium height medium weight medium build probably not too many men fit that bill
that's a nasty scratch on your neck
i have a passionate girlfriend
what's with the boxes?
you're a cop figure it out
okay i'll arrange things with your assignment captain  marty's a good man brian
i'd say you're moving
the passionate one?

walter i'd like you to try something for me
what?
i'd like you to keep a journal
a diary?
that's right
no way
hey  so are you dating your boss or what?
why not?
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
i don't understand
evidence
oh it never crossed my mind
of course
it was just an idea
bad idea
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect
reflect
if you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that i'd probably be pissed  boy you sure know it's a man's world sometimes
that's right
you think reflection is good
it's very good indeed
how's that?
try it
no fucking way
how's the journal?
i'm still thinking about it
you don't like coming here do you?
it's okay
sorry  are you dating anyone?
but you don't like coming here be honest walter
honest? no
good that's an honest answer and why don't you like coming here?
honest? your cheery personality makes my skin itch
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
forget it
maybe it's the way i look or the sound of my name
rosen? i don't have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan i also know a therapist named chung
how do you feel about that?
yeah just her in the shower  nothing happened  look i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up but
you think that's really any of your business?
i don't feel anything
you have no feelings for your niece?
she was born after they put me away how can i have feelings?
then why are you talking about this?
have to talk about something
what are you afraid will happen?
i'm not afraid i'm just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer
have you talked to carlos about your concerns?
i'm not that crazy
do you think you're crazy?
well you did invite me here
if i'm not then what the hell am i doing here?
why do you think you're here?
you know why it's part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about?
talking to you is like riding on a merrygoround
how long is this going to take?
we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
we have a lot of work to do
will i ever be normal?
okay
i couldn't say
you couldn't say
i'm afraid not
do you know what "normal" is?
i suppose it's however society defines it
how do you define it?
i don't
then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
they usually tell me
how do they know?
boy rimgale's as slow as a snail isn't he?
what is your idea of being normal?
what is your idea of being a jew?
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you  why don't we continue this on thursday
i want to be normal
then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal
fuck you rosen
i know 
you don't know
i don't know
what did you think would happen?
no he's more of a dinosaur guy's not a dummy though he's juggling alot of balls on this one
i don't know
what did you want to happen?
you know that if anything happens i spend the rest of my life in prison no parole no nothing
is this the first one?
of course it is that's why i'm telling you
walter we'll pick up here next time
i want to talk about it now
we'll talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
go home walter
yeah but it doesn't take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
you're very late
sorry
please don't do it again
i said i was sorry
when did it all start?
you mean my problem?
if by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i don't know
that's not a helpful answer
close your eyes
jesus give him a break there isn't enough proof yet to go public sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts but you can't rush this stuff not 'till it's locked
what?
i'd like you to close your eyes
why?
to relax
i'm relaxed
close your eyes and let your mind be blank
no i am not going to 
when i say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
nothing can i open my eyes?
no when i say the word "pretty" when i say the word "pleasure" what is the earliest memory you see?
but rimgale's probably going to come around to arson
i don't see 
who do you see?
where is she? what is she doing? how old 
not so fast
sorry  where is she?
in my bedroom sleeping
where?
in my bed rosen where do you think?
where are you?
in my bed too
thanks for the invite
how old are you and your sister?
we're little kids
but roughly how old?
and what are you doing?
just lying there  we're taking a nap
a nap?
what the hell are you doing there?
did you and your sister often take naps together?
don't ever do that again
all right
got anything to drink in there?
i don't like nobody behind my back
walter what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
nothing
did you touch her? did you take off her clothes? did you take off your clothes?
this is garbage
i'm only asking questions
okay i'll tell you what i did  just to shut you up  i smelled her hair
what else?
that's all i just liked smelling her hair
you felt pleasure
no i don't think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it  i mean to say the least you outta know better  you don't know her well enough she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her it's fuckin' over  you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference you're dead
this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city lotta tradition locked up in here what do you think?
did you get an erection?
i was six years old
when the two of you held each other when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine when your parents were out and the two of you were alone completely alone in that big house
it was a small house
all right a small house with small rooms
she's still really hurt and angry i don't know if she will ever forgive me i understand that i do i just hope i just want her to
it's going to take time walter
time
how do you feel about that?
what?
homey
are you okay?
want a ride?
i'm all right
there's something wrong with this picture
what picture?
i'm talking about you
me?
here's this nice hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work i mean who rides the bus anymore?
very weird
no weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard
see that trap door up there? that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horsedrawn engines it was pretty different then but kinda the same y'know?
what's weird about that?
most women wouldn't choose it
you're quiet at work
i'm just quiet
you don't hang out with the other guys
neither do you
you never spoke to me before
are you?
southern light
what?
do you miss it?  you seem like you do
your windows face south northern light is the purest but southern light is very good
i'll buy a plant

k through sixth
doesn't it get noisy?
i like the noise
my place faces a truck street i've got cracks in every window from the shaking
you must hate it
what about bears?
when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman
what about them?
they could eat you
i thought you were just shy but now i think it's something else
what?
something happened to you
i'm not easily shocked
i get that impression
so what's your dark secret?
why do you want to know?
so?
then why did you quit?
what?
so you're not a dyke
hey that was intense
you're still here
i didn't say i didn't enjoy it
of course sorry i'm such a fucking asshole
no you're not
what's the problem?
you think i have a problem?

the worst?
so what did you do?
i molested little girls
molested little girls?
you're not joking
look you can go now
you told swayzak about our arson lead it's all over the fucking news
sorry
what did you do to them?
it's not what you think
how young?
i never hurt them never
twelve years in prison?
why don't you just go now okay?
i told you i'm not easily shocked
you should be shocked or do you get off on this shit?
what?
i didn't know it was a secret there aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators 
get your kicks somewhere else
hey i'm not 
depraved? my mistake
you don't molest little girls anymore do you?
what was prison like?
you don't really 
you mean the time you're locked away?
no prison is time that's it you think time you feel time you hear time your heart doesn't beat to live it just beats time
i'm sorry walter
my father took me fishing here when i was a kid he could name every fish in the lake and for every fish he named he had a fishing story i hated fishing but i loved his stories
i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think she's innocent
 bullshit you knew what i told you wasn't ready for the papers 
sounds like a special guy
i've changed
is it their innocence? their beauty?
their power they seduce me
they seduce you?
i was always the one seduced
you really believe that?
no that's what i used to tell myself
and what do you tell yourself now?
nothing it's over
will you please keep your voice down there's people 
you know this is crazy
what?
being here with me
i know
most people say the odds are against me
what odds?
for men like me they say most of us end up back there i'm saying there are risks seeing me
well most people are stupid  you want to talk about odds? one day i'll tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons you wanna talk about odds?
i got poked around here and there
which brother did this?
 you could have scared the son of a bitch off we may never bust him now all for a couple's political points
all three  in chronological order
you must hate your brothers
i love my brothers
no you don't
i love all of them they're strong gentle men with families of their own and if you asked them about what they did to me they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you
you never asked them about it?
are you serious?
not ever?
maybe this isn't a good idea
what?
i was doing my job
you're scared
i'm not scared
neither am i
we should live together
live together
it's a bad idea
i don't even know how to live with myself
just think about it
i've got problems
who doesn't?
yeah? and just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
most people don't have my kind of problems
guess that makes you pretty special
i say we call it quits
what's this?
i don't need a plant
thank you
don't be scared walter
i'm not scared

24 trident missiles  eight mirvs per missile
i want 'roundtheclock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras  we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion
you've got some huevos bringing this thing into my rig  with everything that's been going on up in the world you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic or is it just me?
you don't need to know the details of this mission you're better off if you don't
i don't have the slightest idea
you're right i don't  i just need to know that this thing is out of here  you hear me roger ramjet?
deepcore deepcore this is cab three on final approach
cab three check  right behind you
what's you depth cab three?
1840 50 60 70

a nonterrestrial intelligence
look you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go and he goes right?
well yeah but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy  when he gets down there he'll just sit like a dumbshit  unless something wanders through view of the camera you'll get nada
no  just you and me  we get some proof then tell them  hippy look if was can prove to coffey it's not russians maybe he'll ease off the button a little
i'll see ya around huh?
schoenick your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move
he can't get to the door i think he's going to try and take him himself
12000 feet  jesus i don't believe he's doing this
uh oh
fluid breathing system  we just got them  we use it if we need to go really deep
how deep?
hey
stand by on the rov
getting a reading?
you boss is having a fullon meltdown  guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside
brian mccaffrey  oh this is really a treat brian mccaffrey lost a dad to the animal huh?
highpressure nervous syndrome  muscle tremors usually in the hands first  nausea increased excitability disorientation
4800 feet  it's official
8500 feet bud  everything okay?
ask him a pressure effects  tremors vision problems euphoria
he's losing it  talk to him  keep him with us
he can still make it
what kind of light?
would we see the flash?
but your friend is waiting downstairs
when do you have to go back?
i'm close but i can't get who it is
i don't know it depends on ettore he's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in sicily
then how come you're not with him?
i'd like to find a place where i can get some peace and rest maybe around here somewhere i'd like to try
how are you?
anna maybe it would be better to wait a while
sandro a month is too long a time i have become used to being without you
you'll get over it soon it's the usual anxiety
a little more so this time
so it will just take you a little longer to get over it
but i think we should talk about it or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
okay here's the deal i'll tell you a story you tell me one fair?
there will be plenty of time to talk about it later  we'll  get married  soon  that way we'll have more time
in this case getting married means nothing aren't we already the same as being married? and corrado and giulia  aren't they already the same as being married?
but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking believe me anna words never help at all they only serve to confuse i love you anna isn't i that enough?
no it's not enough i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone
but you just said that a month was too
i mean to stay away longer  two months a year three years yes i know it sounds absurd and i feel awful the very idea of losing you makes me want to die and yet i i just don't have the same feeling for you any more
and what about yesterday at my house didn't you have any feeling for me even then?
but where are you going?
i'm thirsty
you know i could just as well go without seeing him today
who's doing this?
did you sleep well?
yes fairly well but i went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things  instead i fell asleep
which one shall i wear?
this one is gorgeous
claudia aren't you coming?
i'm certainly not going to swim across
isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
and how long will you be away?
four or five days
used to what?
now i do  back then was a different story
why'd you help me back there with the chief?  why'd you stand up for me like that?
your first question should be who isn't it isn't a spark brian not enough damage and an insurance pro? where's the profit margin?
to the fact of my retirement not only as a diplomat but also as a father
but how could you say such a thing?
because it's true after thirty years  not having ever spoken the truth to anyone i should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter
and have you any other truths to tell me?
you already know what they are
up until now dad i've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him
i presume by this method that you'll be able to uncover some new clue either a handkerchief or an article of clothing in other words something which your men have not been able to find as yet
without any doubt sir if anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island
allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive
i'm sorry sir i didn't mean to put it that way but you must understand sir that i
then who 
this looks to me like a good sign don't you think so? as far as i'm concerned anyone who reads the bible could not have committed an act of impropriety why as a matter of fact i remember when i was in china many years ago i happened to be involved in a similar situation concerning an english woman the wife of ambassador shafford a good friend of mine there too we found a bible and i said at the time that whatever had happened that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of suicide why it was logical i said that whoever reads the bible believes in god and therefore  no? you don't believe it? well as a matter of fact i was right the woman was found two days later it was a case of amnesia
it's already two hours what are we going to do?
these people are contemptible they have no sense of dignity at all
and you say that came from lisca bianca?
it couldn't have come from anywhere else at least somewhere from that vicinity but i really can't understand it contraband cigarettes on that island it's the first time that ever happened
look i'd like to get back to lisca bianca
but how could weat a time like this when we just well let's at least first have a look around the other islands could be that something might turn up there
but even here we were supposed to find who knows what and all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes
what is that one over there called?
that must be basiluzzo
 no no your turn tell me a story
say claudia wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
at what?
well?
well what?
have you decided?
how wonderful
i think you're very sweet corrado
more so than the shark?
there's no comparison
somebody must live here
i don't have a story
really still it remains to be seen why she invented a shark what was her purpose in that?
maybe you'd better ask him
i have a feeling that you're not used to being alone
don't be so humble
how should i be  arrogant?
there's nothing much to laugh at
shall we go for a swim?
twelve years  but why haven't they married?
and why haven't they left each other?
i'm beginning to have my doubts it couldn't be that they're in love?
famous story even straight burn just an engine and truck first on scene what did you feel brian when you first got there?
find anything?
as far as i'm concerned i think she's alive why even this morning that business about the shark it wasn't at all true
and why do you tell us this only now?
nothing but the usual argument the only thing was  if i remember correctly  that she said she had a need to be alone
nothing nothing at all
and i suppose it's my fault why don't you tell him that too that's what you believe isn't it?
are you feeling better?
i'm sorry about last night please forgive me
you're very fond of anna aren't you?
yes very much so
what?
has she ever spoken to you about me?
occasionally but always with affection
and yet she seemed to feel that our love for her  mine yours even her father's in a certain sense  weren't enough for her or didn't mean much to her
i think that you might go and have a look yourself
where are you going? to montaldo's?
yes
have you read it? they're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them
yes i had also thought of going there to talk with them
yes you should go
sandro i don't want you to come with me i don't want to see you how can i make it clear to you?why did you come?
you gotta tell a story too brian it's fair c'mon don't think too hard 
i don't know why i just couldn't help it
but sooner or later we've got to end this relationship and it's better to do it right now
i have no desire to sacrifice myself it's idiotic to sacrifice oneself why? for whom? if anna were here i might understand your scruples but she's not
oh sandro
i'm sorry i didn't want to sound cynical but isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
for me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago  just three days ago don't you realize? and you and anna no i guess they aren't like that any more my god is it possible to forget in such a short time for things to change so quickly?
it takes even less
but it's so sad so terribly sad i'm not used to it i'm not ready for it you know i have never been so upset in my life sandro why don't you help me?
i think the only way to help ourselves claudia is for us to be together
no i'm sure it won't move over there let's make believe nothing happened and when we get to the next station get off
i i thought it was great i loved it it was nothing to these guys medium deal
and what about you?
claudia listen to me
promise that you won't try to look for me you shouldn't try to look for me any more
any news?
let's get out of here fast this is not a town it's a cemetery
sandro  maybe it's best that you go in alone
are you joking?
what is it claudia?
oh sandro i'm so ashamed of myself so ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so small i hate myself 
does it please you to say such things?
right light smoke low roll couple'a civilians hollering  medium deal so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape  mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across what were you feeling brian?  c'mon you promised be honest  okay guard
oh no it doesn't please me at all
then why do you say them?
good it's better if it were absurd that would mean nothing much can be done about it
but just think  the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times maybe even just before we left while i was waiting outside your place
really i've got to stop this business with ettore i would like to go back and start working on my own projects again you know i had many ideas
and why did you drop them?
why are you looking at me like that?
i'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things
claudia let's get married?
what get married?
 i wanted to be him right then i wanted to be him more than anything
yes we'll get married you and i what do you say?
what do i say? what can i say? no at least not yet i don't know i can't even think of it at a time like this oh but why did you have to ask me?
you look at me as though i had said something foolish
and are you sure you want to marry me? are you really surethat you want to marry me?
that's why i asked you
but why am i so infatuated with you?
hurry up now or it'll begin to get hot outside
and you leave me here all alone in this hotel room
but you know it already why must i tell you?
then i'll see you later
sowho's nicky?
very good brian  about your report here the way to a torch's heart is through his tools that's how you know him it's the way he talks to the fire and to you if you listen
sandro what's the matter?
no sandro please
why?
sandro wait a moment just one moment you seem like an entirely different person 
what are you saying?
i was only joking really can't i make a joke? and now you've got to tell me why you don't want to
did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
yes she started to but i didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say if we had to listen to everybody
no sandro we should go besides we haven't been in touch with anybody not even with anna's father we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned let's be fair he must be feeling awfully lonely
sandro listen try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow
the outlets
aren't you going to change?
sandro i'm not coming down
why?
i'm too sleepy
you're that sleepy eh? what time do expect to get up tomorrow?
good night my love
good night tell me that you love me
i love you
tell me once more
i don't love you
that's a probie answer you're smarter than that brian
well with a shark running loose around the place i for one won't get aboard that raft they'll have to catch it first i want to see it right here before my feet dead or alive
tell me claudia what do you think of raimondo?
i would say he's pretty depraved
he amuses me i don't know of anything more amusing outside of this jigsaw puzzle don't you find it so claudia?
one would have to be in love with somebody to know that
have you ever been in love?
what amazes me is sandro he seems so calm
i'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands
to do what?
i just can't leave without first searching those islands one by one
trychticholorate
but where did you finally end up?
it's divine
you say that just to flatter me
do you consider that a compliment?
i'm not coming
shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
how do you manage to put up with all this confusion? you always said people bore you
my childhood instead was a very sensible one
what do you mean by sensible?
patrizia patrizia  where's ettore?
who the fuck is doing this?
i imagine he must be inside sleeping
patrizia i'm afraid
more or less we are all afraid especially at night
i'm afraid that anna has come back i feel she's back and that they're together
now listen for god's sake try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea go to your room and get back into bed
just several days ago the thought of anna being dead would have made me sick and now i don't even cry i'm afraid she might be alive everything is becoming so damned simple and easy even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering
you should never wish to get melodramatic over anything
who are you talking to?
please you come too
but for what reason should i come there?
oh jesus christ
they're all nudes if i'm not mistaken
and tell corrado too that i'm here if he wants me you can also tell him that my tiny little heart is beating like mad and that at this moment it's the only thing that interests me is that clear?
now what do i have to do to be left in peace?
it's as smooth and slick as oil
at one time the aeolian isles were all volcanoes
what happened?
there's a shark in the area don't move from where you are
why didn't you ask me to go with you?
do you know why? because if you saw those ruins i'm sure you would have said they were very very beautiful you always say "how beautiful" to everything  whether it's the sea or a baby or a cat you have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything
but corrado  if something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
if it was a joke sir you'd be laughing
he never misses a chance to humiliate me to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more
looks like the weather is changing
i'll stay here also
but why? what if it starts to rain?
how did you spend the night? in that hut? and what did you have to eat?
what do you think?
corrado why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
but how can you carry on a discussion in this heat?
i'm going ashore to take a look around the island there are some ruins up there
there too
you walked out on this academy six years ago one week to graduation you think we forgot that? you think i did?
it's really a fact  there's nothing new under the sun now look here look at this structure a kind of natural shelter sandro that's how you should design your houses
let's try to be practical about this the best thing to do is for all of you to go to the closest island that has a police station or something and report the disappearance i'll remain here because well i don't know but it seems to me that something may turn up anyway i just don't feel like leaving
claudia i know how you feel but there are already two of us staying
and what are we going to do now?
up until now those smugglers were operating only around the palermo area this will be a nice surprise for the lieutenant in milazzo call up headquarters bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate
so the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers could it be possible then that anna?
i wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff  maybe right here at lisca
i was saying it might even be possible that anna had left with them
but for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
listen marshal as for there being reasons for going away anyone of us might have three thousand of them so you can assume that she had them what i want to know is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
i want another shot sir
and who is this?
first let the poor thing have something to eat
ettore
what is it?
nothing nothing  at all i was just looking for sandro
and you expect to find him in here? go and ask claudia
let's see you dive from the top of those rocks giulia that would be really sensational  come on giulia  your life is much too circumscribed
where is she going?
the trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you that's all
giulia don't you understand that the more involved you become with people the more difficult it is to speak with them?
look everybody remembers your old man being his son all you had to do was breathe to graduate here dead hero father rule but you blew us off why should i take you back?
you men are all so dreadful
goffredo is the princess' nephew he's eighteen years old the lucky boy and what do you know  he paints
giulia
because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman
and where do you find the models?
oh there are as many as one wants
it's strange how anxious women are to display themselves it's almost a natural inclination
but how could they pose like that? i couldn't
why don't you try?
don't you ever paint men?
what do you want?
if you remember sir my test scores were in the top 
answer me why don't you try posing? i'll paint you a beautiful portrait
but why me? ask claudia she's much more beautiful than me
but i want to paint you you appeal to me more
they tell me you have a lot of trouble at home is that right?
yes sir my sister is sick and my father too
yes sir three times
now we're getting somewhere they're beginning to contradict each other  now look here your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough and what about the other boat?
what other boat?
now look my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard what have you got to say about that?
i work there but i'm really a stranger
 i don't give a damn what your test scores were maybe you could have been a good firemen but you had your shot
i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you
and who is she? does she work in catania?
yes she takes care of the garden
then it's impossible for her to know me in the villa where i'm at we have a male gardener
so? that's logical you see both being gardeners they spoke about you to one another
and what did they say about me?
we have a radio like this too
no not like this one
and why wouldn't we have one like this?
certainly a radio this small is very practical it's especially useful for i don't know for traveling
i need another one sir
music of course to get a sweetheart one has to look around but to get a radio all you have to do is buy one
anything new develop?
unfortunately no
very well first of all i'll have them search the waters around the island i brought two frogmen with me meanwhile we'll take a look up around here
look marshal with those deep crevasses you'll need some rope and ladders
don't worry we've got everything
another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island
i only exchanged a few casual words with her as one would ordinarily do on a public bus
and do you remember where she got off?
then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
sorry but it's out of my hands try again next year
there's the trinacria hotel or the regina near the municipal building as for rooming houses i don't know
thank you
are you the owner of this place?
no the owners are in australia
but where did you come from?
whose boat is that?
what boat?
just a moment ago didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
at this time of the year there are so many boats
and how come you're up so early?
no it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me if i push you have to let me back in dead hero father rule sir
perhaps she wasn't feeling well maybe a cramp or something
anna is an excellent swimmer even with a cramp she would have managed to reach shore somehow
listen patrizia the marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island i don't know which he wants to send one of his men over to have a look one never knows do you mind if i ask raimondo to go with him?
patrizia what are you going to do?
what do you want us to do? i don't know myself but we'll do something
we've decided to go to montaldo's place in fact ettore should already be there
and here's sandro  why don't you two go upstairs and change?
did you manage to find good rooms?
they didn't seem too good
you should have told ettore he always manages to get what he wants
even if you graduate this academy you've still got nine months of probation that's hard duty son if you don't really love this job it'll kill you
ettore must be fed up with me by now
your mother?
why have we stopped?
raimondo do you enjoy fishing underwater?
now tell the truth aren't you a bit disappointed? but i already told you
patrizia don't start in again i would rather be called depraved unless you happen to love children
you know i don't love anybody
you've made some mistake there with the bushes that's why you can't finish it
here i am patrizia i'm always here
zuria?
uh i'm brian mccaffrey your new assistant
yes until proven otherwise
i would like to ask you something
she costs a hundred thousand lire
you're kidding
oh i'm sorry i have to rush but i've got to write a story about this thing that just happened tell me exactly how it all turned out
as a matter of fact i've already had several phone calls on that article one said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in rome another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors could be she secretly left the island by boat
is that possible?
who knows? another one has it that she entered a store in troina this information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought i don't know what in his store at troina
is that far from here?
about fifty miles or so if you want i'll give you the name of the storekeeper
are you still here?
yes of course but you should also print that in your paper but right away tomorrow morning it's the local palermo paper isn't it? i mean it's widely read
yes but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? even if i sent it the editors wouldn't print it
you really must do me this one favor
pardon me but why must i do you a favor?
agnes it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating why is this? agnes  i've been commanded by god
he talked to you himself?
no
through someone else?
yes
who?
get used to me inspector i'm not going anywhere
i can't say
why?
she'd punish me
one of the other sisters?
no
because i'm getting fat
oh for heaven's sake
i am there's too much flesh on me
agnes
i'm a blimp
then go find a corner i don't want you in my way
why does it matter whether you're fat or not
because
 you needn't worry about being attractive here
i do i have to be attractive to god
he loves you the way you are
no he doesn't he hates fat people
who told you this?
it's a sin to be fat
why?
look at the statues they're thin
your opinion  you see they going to make a movie about me too eddie  and write books
i think we should get something straight here i was assigned to this office by the city
agnes
that's because they're suffering suffering is beautiful i want to be beautiful
who tells you these things?
christ said it in the bible he said  suffer the little children i want to suffer like a little child
that's not what he meant
i i am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon i i won't be able to fit in i i won't be able to squeeze into heaven
no i mean i mean look at these i've got to lose weight i'm a blimp
oh my dear child
god blew up the hindenburg he'll blow me up that's what she said
who?
where are you going?
mommy i'll get bigger and bigger every day and then i'll pop but but if i stay little it won't happen
your mother tells you this? agnes your mother is dead
but she watches she listens
nonsense i'm your mother now and i want you to eat
i'm not hungry
you've got to eat something agnes
no i don't the host is enough
my dear i don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything
of god
i'm being punished
 shhh
why?
i don't know
sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister is that true?
yes mother
why?
we're not in the middle ages sister
it made them holy
it made them uncomfortable and if they didn't sleep well i'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules sister where are your sheets?  do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
no
then tell me where are your sheets?
so you were happy here warm and cozy and in no hurry  soot high clean unburned wall low indicates slow burn in thermal balance  find me some glass
i burnt them
why?
they were stained
how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of
yes mother
a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears asking for comfort comfort because she was too old to have any children not that she wanted to but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility
it's not that it's not that
what do you mean?
it's not my time of month
should you see a doctor?
glass?
i don't know i don't know what happened mother i woke up there was blood on the sheets but i don't know what happened  i don't know what i did wrong i don't know and i should be punished
for what?
i don't know i don't know
hello i'm doctor livingston i've been asked to talk to you may i?
you have a lovely voice
no i don't
i just heard you
that wasn't me
no i'm not
hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn explosion must of come after a slow burn  you little tease what were you up to you little bastard huh? what made you that mad?  or scared  it started in this room took its time hung out but the air ran out it couldn't breathe so it was snuffed but it wasn't dead still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air
let's talk about something else
what would you like to talk about
i don't know
anything may i sit down?
first thing that comes to your mind?
god  but there's nothing to say about god
second thing that comes to your mind
love
have you ever loved anyone?
yes
temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire
who?
everyone
well who in particular?
right now?
uh huh
i love you
agnes have you ever loved another man other than jesus christ?
yes
who?
oh there are so many
uh i don't think that's in my contract
well do you love do you love father martineau?
oh yes
do you think he loves you?
oh i know he does
he's told you?
no but when i look into his eyes i can tell
you've been alone together?
yes
often?
at least once a week
read
and you like that?
oh yes
where do you meet?
you want to talk about the baby don't you?
would you like to talk about it?
i never saw any baby i think they made it up
why should they?
i don't know
do you remember the night they said it came?
no i was sick
"trychtichlorate is a binary structured "
how were you sick?
something i ate
did it hurt?
yes
where?
down there
and what did you do?
i went to my room
and what happened?
i got sicker
what's your accomplishment
 go to the bottom under heat properties
and then what?
i fell asleep
in the middle of all the pain?
yes
where did the baby come from?
what baby?
the baby they made up
from their heads
is that where they say it came from ?
no they say it came from the waste paper basket
"during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium"
where'd it come from before that?
from god
after god before the wastepaper basket
i i don't understand
agnes how are babies born?
don't you know?
yes i do  but i want you to
i don't understand what you're talking about you want to talk about the baby everybody wants to talk about the baby but i never saw the baby so i can't talk about the baby because i don't believe in the baby
then let's talk about something else
no no i'm tired of talking i've been talking for weeks nobody believes me when i tell them anything nobody listens to me
son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace  unless you could find something that would eat its residue
agnes
no no i don't want to answer any more questions
would you like to ask them?
what do you mean?
just that you ask and i'll answer
anything?
what's your real name?
martha louise livingston
are you married?
no
look it isn't proof okay? someone may have put the chemical in the outlet but we found it as a vapor in cosgrove's clothes
would you like to be?
not at the moment no
do you have any children?
no
would you like some?
i can't have them any more
why not?
i've stopped menstruating
why do you smoke?
does it bother you?
and the putty around the door?
no questions
smoking is an obsession with me maybe one day i'll become obsessed with something else then i'll stop smoking do you have any more questions?
one
where do you think babies come from?
from their mothers and fathers of course before that i i don't know
do you know a marie?
no do you?
why should i?
you liked sister paul?
she was kind to me she told me i was beautiful
even if it was used to seal the air off that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft a gun's a helluva lot easier
what else did she tell you?
sister paul was in her eighties?  did she climb up here often?
no only when she felt like it she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died
no wonder wait agnes agnes how do you feel about babies?
oh they frighten me i'm afraid i'll drop them they have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid i was dropped on my head that's why i don't understand things
like what?
numbers you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end
i don't understand them either do you suppose i was dropped on my head?
i hope not it's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head
what happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
but the right guess on this is arson
it's like hiding from my mother when i was a little girl
where did you go?
oh no place as wonderful as this agnes have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
no there is nothing else just being here at night helps me sleep
you have trouble sleeping?
i get headaches mommy did too oh but she wasn't stupid she knew things that nobody else knew
what things?
she knew what was going to happen to me that's why she hid me away
how did she know that?
somebody told her
i don't guess
who?
i don't know
agnes
you'll laugh
i promise i won't laugh who told her?
an angel when she was having one of her headaches
did your mother see angels often?
no
do you?
no
some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case
do you believe she really saw them?
no but i can never tell her that
why not?  mmm?
agnes did you love your mother?
yes
did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
i could never be a mother
why not?
well i don't think i'm old enough and besides i don't want to have a baby
why not?
that's it oh that son of a bitch he's different goddamn it you see what this tells us huh? our killer doesn't love fire
because i don't want one
if you did want one how'd you go about getting one?
from someone who didn't want to have a baby
how would that person get one if they didn't want one?
a mistake
agnes how did your mother get you?
a mistake it was a mistake
is that what she said?
if you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true she was a good woman a saint 
agnes i don't believe you know nothing about sex
i kill someone famous
what?
i can't help it if i'm stupid
 that you don't remember getting pregnant
not my fault
 and that you don't believe you carried a child
i was a mistake
what the child?
everything i don't have children
agnes i'm here because i want to help you
i'm not sick
but you're troubled aren't you?
i got it after we talked to ronald torches want to fry the whole goddamn world but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much  the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls and he made his burns backdrafts 
that's because you keep reminding me if you go away then i'll forget
and you're unhappy
everyone's unhappy you're unhappy aren't you?
agnes
answer me  you never answer me
sometimes yes
what did you do?
i'm always bad
what did you do?
agnes what did your mother do to you?  if you can't answer me just shake your head yes or no did did she hit you?  did she make you do something you didn't want to?  did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  did it embarrass you?  did it did it hurt you?  what did she make you you do?
but he killed these guys
no
you can tell me
i can't
she's dead isn't she?
yes
she can't hurt you any more
she can
how?
she watches she listens
agnes i don't believe that tell me i'll protect you from her
but he could have killed everybody there the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall the backdraft blew out the flame that's it that's the reason
she
yes?
 makes me
yes?
 take off my clothes and then she makes fun of me
she tells you you're ugly?
yes
and that you're stupid?
yes
that you're a mistake?
what reason?
she says my whole body's a mistake
why?
because she says if i don't watch out i'll have a baby
how does she know that?
her headaches
oh yes
and then
what?
she touches me down there with a cigarette  please mommy don't touch me like that any more i'll be good  i won't be a baby any more
agnes oh agnes agnes i want you to do something i want you to pretend that i'm your mother oh yes only this time i want you to tell me what you're feeling alright?
why backdrafts whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out
i'm afraid
please  i want to help you let me help you
alright
agnes you're ugly what do you say? of course you do agnes you're ugly what do you say?
no i'm not
are you pretty?
yes
agnes you're stupid
no i'm not
are you intelligent?
that's why the sealant on the doors so what have we got a torch with a conscience?
yes i am

agnes can you hear me?
yes
she said michael
the statue she had shown it to me the day before
and the passage to the barn?
yes
why?
this is the copy of swayzak's manning report that was released everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers they're all airtight
so i could go to him
who?
him
how did she know about him?
she'd seen him too
where?
from the belltower the day she before she died
so she sent you?
are you frightened?
it's bleeding i'm bleeding my god it won't stop i can't get it to stop  let go of me i wish you were dead
i've got three different drafts of the same report  with different numbers that're all over the place looks like they were just making it up as they went along
stay away from me
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god he did a terrible thing to you do you understand?
no
he frightened you and he hurt you it's not your fault it's his fault tell us who he is so we can find him stop him from doing this to other women
not your fault
agnes who did you see?
i hate him
of course you do who was it?
i hate him for what he did to me
yes
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report they did exactly one job  swayzak's manpower study it's not even really a company no employees no directors just a po box
for what he made me go through
who?
i hate him
god  it was god  and now i'll burn in hell because i hate him
it was dead
it was alive wasn't it?
mother miriam was with you wasn't she?
yes
she took the baby in her arms?
yes
then who wrote the report?
you saw it all didn't you?
yes
and then what did she do?  agnes what did she do?
what did you do?
i put her to sleep
h how?
i've been watching we were fine 'till she came she brought the devil here  there was blood on her hand that night
agnes?  who?  mother superior?
???
what?
well brian i guess you can say it's arson now
look into the convent records
are you dictating my position to me? we're getting into some sticky legal territories here
martha all we're saying is noone wants this to come to trial not the church not the crown least of all me
eve she strangled a baby
martha you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law
no no excuse me eve as quickly as i see fit
the longer you take to make a decision the more difficult it will be for us
why?
the bishop is breathing down our necks
here you are don't let anyone know where you got them
so tabloids don't have to do re enactments  they going to have real movie this time
did you pull me out?
larry
marty what are you doing here?
larry there's got to be something missing
i gave you the pictures marty what else do you want?
something they that they overlooked
what?  you think that the girl is innocent?
i don't know
larry
what's the matter with you you've seen the reports it's a cut and dried case
maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be
yeah
thanks 
martha it's you
would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long
???
all i want is one more week
why?  you've done nothing to show any progress
yes that's because i'm getting to her
you're getting to all of us martha let's face it
i'll have a decision by next week
it's gone on long enough you're out
did i say thanks?
oh joe joe she didn't kill the baby
you have proof?
i'll have it
when?
no no no
i can get you new evidence next week
no
hello mama   brought you something
shut up i'm trying to watch this
it's your favourite
no
who are you?
it's martha mama  there you go
marie brings me icecream too you know chocolate my favourite
i thought cherryvanilla was your favourite
not any more now i like chocolate
did you have a good week mama are they treating you all right?
you know martha never comes to see me you watch it she's going straight to hell after all the things she said to me then she marries that son of a bitch of a frenchman has an abortion i knew that one wouldn't work out not like you marie you got married to god
marie's dead mama
i remember when you was a little girl marie you come back from the movies and you'd say  mama that ending was so sad and i'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in hollywood  and you believed me
mama that wasn't marie that was me
just wondering
who are you?
the convent was built for over fifty not many of us left just us and the chickens
how do you survive?
oh we own the land around here but we rent it out we keep a few acres for ourselves  some wheat corn some vegetables
well that's a lot of land you must have help do you have field hands that help you?
no we work the land alone noone but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public
oh that one there in the corner
the one up on the third floor?
yes
no
so what do you want me to do?
well you're probably right about that it certainly can't help sister agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time
why do you call it an investigation? i never have
your mother was a resident of saint catherines home before you moved her
and you had a sister who died in the convent
who told you this?
do you still go to church?
what business is it of yours?
oh we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
look father ah just because i don't subscribe to the to the beliefs you subscribe to
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor but it does make all the difference to agnes
your brother was a good man
i don't understand are you expecting me to?
i'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age
yes i
you can call me sister
 thank you
you were a smoker?
two packs a day
i can beat that
who knew about agnes' pregnancy?
noone
yeah
how did she hide it from the other nuns?
she undressed alone she bathed alone
is that normal?
yes
how did she hide it during the day?
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to
didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
we're examined once a year her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits
who was the father?
i haven't a clue
another couple of good men get burned up for their city? is that how it's going to read?  you're the only one that knows
what man had access to her?
none as far as i know
was there a priest?
yes but i
what's his name?
father martineau but i don't see him as a candidate
could there have been anyone else?
obviously there was
and you didn't try to find out who?
believe me i've done everything possible short of asking agnes
brian?
she can't even remember the birth do you think she'd admit to the conception?
look someone gave her the baby
yes but that was some ten months ago i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial
why do you think that?
don't ask me those questions dear i'm not the patient
well i'm the doctor i'm the one who's going to decide what is or is not important here
look doctor i don't know how to tell you this politely but i don't approve of you not you personally
the science of psychiatry
exactly i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible she won't hold up under any sort of cross examination
i am not with the inquisition
you really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  how fuckin' stupid are you?
hi helen man you look great
well what do you think?  is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar
what's your opinion?
i believe agnes is different
from other nuns  yes i i've noticed
from other people  i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
because she's an innocent she's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by god
that's ridiculous
in her case it isn't she's had very little schooling her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us she's never been out there doctor she's never seen a movie or a television show she's never even read a book
if she's so innocent how come she murdered a child?
'bout written you off how long have you been in town?
she didn't  this is manslaughter not murder she didn't consciously kill that baby she'd lost a lot of blood she was unconscious by the time we got to her
so someone else could have done it
no not in the eyes of the police
and in your eyes?
i've already told you what i thought
that she was unconscious yes  so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the
you don't really believe something like that happened do you?
it's possible isn't it?
who?
that's absurd
four months
that possibility never occurred to you?
this convent is locked solid the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she wouldn't let christ in after dark
well it's been known to happen in the day too maybe agnes went to him
oh come on you've talked to her she doesn't even know how babies are born let alone made
when did you first learn about her innocence the way she thinks?
shortly after she came to us
and you weren't shocked?
i was appalled just as you are now
and what happened?
this was before her pregnancy?
four months?
why didn't you take her to a doctor?
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again
she had a a hole in the palm of her hand  she could have bled to death
but she didn't did she if anyone had seen what i'd seen she'd be public property newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule she doesn't deserve that
she has it now
i know what you're thinking she's a hysteric pure and simple
not simple no
i saw it clean through the palm of her hand do you think hysteria could do that?
it's being doing it for centuries she's not unique she's just another victim
god's victim that's her innocence she belongs to god
that's sean? jeez he's a giant
you hate us don't you?
what?
nuns you hate nuns
i hate ignorance and stupidity
the catholic church
i haven't said anything against the the catholic church
catholicism is not on trial here i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else
it's my affair too
i'm only interested
she is not a child
yeah you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid
???  
???    virginity right mother?  poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by
i am not a virgin doctor i was married for twenty three years two daughters i even have grandchildren surprised? it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother my children won't even see me any more that's their revenge i think they tell their friends that i've passed on and don't tell me i'm making up for past mistakes doctor freud 
then help her
i am
no you're shielding her let her face the world
what good would it do no matter what you decide it's either the the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin
there's another choice
what?
aquittal
sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle?
how?
all right what do you need
when would agnes have conceived the child?
oh some time in january
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
earthquakes?
visitors to the convent
nothing
do you have a a diary or a day book?
yes
well that's two things to strangle stephen for where is he anyway?
there's nothing here
was the child full term?
oh dear god
what is it?
the sheets
what sheets?
when was that?
the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away
sister paul?
you lied to me
oh man i'm sorry
about what?
your niece
i didn't tell you because i didn't think it was important
no it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent my sister ran away from home we lost touch with her and when my husband died and i came here she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened
like keeping her home from school?
yes
listening to angels?
she drank too much that's what killed her
do you know what she did to her?
yeah big fan
i don't think i care to know
she molested her
oh dear god
there is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  lots of dirty little secrets
oh god if only i'd known
why didn't you?  you knew she was keeping her home from school you knew she was an alcoholic
i knew that after the fact
why didn't you do anything to stop her?
because i didn't know 
and my permission?
detective does it look like a murder?
and i'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian
we'll see about that
don't deny it
i haven't decided yet
the woman's health is at stake
her spiritual health
i don't give a damn about her spiritual health
an unhappy woman
she's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone
because i am a moral person
bullshit
uh i think there's been a mistake i didn't save that woman
bullshit yourself
catholic church doesn't have a corner on morality
who said anything about the catholic church
you just said
what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you?
nothing
it wasn't sex it was a lot of things but it wasn't sex you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said?  she died because she hadn't said her morning prayers
stupid woman and that's all?
that's all?  that's enough  she was a beautiful little girl
and what has that to do with it?
no need to be modest brian
i wasn't i wasn't she was the pretty one she died why not me?  i never said my morning prayers and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me polkadot livingston
so you left the church because you had freckles?
my sister died in a convent and it's her voice i hear  does my smoking bother you?
no it reminds me
would you like one?  huh?
i'm out of prac   practice 
all right?
fine thanks
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
undoubtedly not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more
no you don't understand i saved a mannequin
long thin and filtered
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet  and of course 
hand rolled
even christ would partake socially
saint peter?
pipe
right
mary magdelen?
oh you've come a long way baby
right  what do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
 that really was incredibly work you did you and your brother fighting fires together helluva image isn't it? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command
there are no saints today good people yes but extraordinarily good people those i'm afraid we are sorely lacking
do you think they ever existed?
yes i do
do you want to become one?
become?  one is born a saint
well you can try can't you to be good?
do you think agnes is still attached to god?
listen to her singing
i'd like to begin
begin what?
every little boy's fantasy
the hypnotism do you still disapprove?
would it stop you if i did?
may i be present?
of course
stop this she'll hurt herself  i'm not going to allow this
i've just met with the bishop we're taking you off the case
you're what?
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes we'll find our own thank you 
one that will ask the questions you want asked
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect
brian let me come to the point i'd like to offer you a job
for the church?
for agnes
you think she's a saint?
she's been touched by god yes
how?  how?  she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched give me a miracle
the father
who is he?
why must he be anybody?
my god you're as crazy as
stop laughing i don't say it's the truth i'm saying
i have a job
how  ?
don't be ridiculous
well give me a reasonable explanation
a miracle is an event without an explanation if she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
this is insane
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out
but how did it happen?
you'll never find the answer for everything god did
i thought you didn't believe in miracles today mother?
but i want the opportunity to believe i want the choice to believe
this one's still with the fire department one of our best investigators don rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now we think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us: an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped or seduced or that she did the seducing
she is an innocent
but she is not an enigma mother everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry one two three right down the line
that's what you believe she is?  the sum of her psychological parts?
that's what i have to believe
there's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn did you know about that? there's an answer mother that's how she got out
that's crazy how could she find out about it?
somebody told her
who?  that tun that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years
oh would you stop lying mother
yeah we got all kinds of traditions  like dying young
why would i lie?
because it's murder we're talking about aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room
i'm concerned about her health
who was that person mother?  was it you?
this is permission to take her apart
where is she?
hasn't she had enough?
i have a few more questions to ask her
who knew she was pregnant?
why do you insist upon pressing
he said everyone was doing it  so i did it
we don't know that yet  it's much too early  there's a lot to be done
mr mccaffrey
was it you?
is it because she's a nun?
did you know she was pregnant?
yes
and you didn't send her to a doctor
i didn't guess until it was too late
for what?  an abortion?
oh don't be ridiculous
too late for what?
i don't know too late to stop it
nice boat
the baby?
the scandal
you went to the room to help with the birth
she didn't want any help
you wanted that child out of the way
that's a lie
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room
i didn't hide it i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets
and the baby
no
mr mccaffrey keeping busy?
you tied the cord around its neck
i wanted her to have it when noone else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked
before or after you killed the child?
i left it with her and i went for help
i doubt that's what she'd say
that's enough
agnes what happened to the baby?
she can't remember
oh don't do this
of course john
completely out of control
yes they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of liverpool scruffy young lads lacking even the price of a jam roll orphans every paddy's son of 'em i saw their potential at once although i had me doubts about the little fella a savage primitive that ringo but it was him what gave in first he picked up a brick and heaved it at me and i quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes "mister can you spare us a copper?" he said i was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler  so i took them under me managerial banner
the usual ten per cent?
oh not at all i let them have twentyfive; sure aren't there four of them?
how fascinating do go on    john
lay them down
eh?
lay them down
we'd be thrown out
they're yours
they are?
aren't you even curious?
here mate that's my hoop stop playing with it
hoop this isn't a hoop it's a lethal weapon have you got a licence for it?
oh don't be so stroppy

how about ding dong?
why aren't you at work?
i'm a deserter too
what about all these letters?
shurrup

yeah
the police have the poor unfortunate lad in the bridewell
the police station

sure
well that's it two minutes to the final runthrough they're bound to miss it
i'll murder that lennon
you don't think
they'll be here
boys you don't know what this means to me if you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in welsh for life
leave them drums alone
oh surely one can have a tiny touch
if you so much as breathe heavy on them i'm out on strike
lots of fires they promote faster there take a look at the last lt's list half the guys on it came from that battalion gotta think about your future timmy 115's the station
aren't you being rather arbitrary?
that's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches i don't go round messing about with your earphones do i?
spoil sport
would you like to be a little more precise sir?
well that's the wrong line for a start
yeah you know "ok buster follow that car there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close"
ever seen one of these before?
ah  a shamus eh?
i see you go to the night court
i've made the scene
how many victims are up there?
man something sure put a crimp in his evening
we're nearly there sir
he doesn't like me honest i can tell  it's 'cos i'm little
you've got an inferiority complex you have
are you going in?
no she'll only reject me in the end and i'll be frustrated
you never know you might be lucky this time
me? why?
i don't snore
you do  repeatedly
eh ringo do you know what happened to me?
do you have to do that?
look i'm terribly sorry but i'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding
oh you can come off it with us you don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit
i'm afraid i don't understand
we want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers
oh by all means i'd be quite prepared for that eventuality
well not your real opinion naturally it'll be written out and you'll learn it  can he read?
of course i can
i mean lines ducky can you handle lines?
i'll have a bash
good hart get him whatever it is they drink a cokearama?
y'know what stephen said to me right when all the shit was coming hard? "you never know till the moment the fire stares you down if you're just gonna do this job or be great at it"
ta
now you'll like these you really "dig" them they're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles
i wouldn't be seen dead in them they're dead grotty
grotty?
yeah grotesque
make a note of that word and give it to susan i think it's rather touching really here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things of course they're grotty you wretched nit that's why they were designed but that's what you'll want
but i won't
you can be replaced you know chicky baby
i don't care
and that pose is out too sunny jim the new thing is to care passionately and be right wing anyway you won't meet susan if you don't cooperate
what?
and who's this susan when she's at home?
only susan campey our resident teenager you'll have to love her she's your symbol
oh you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
i beg your pardon?
oh yes the lads frequently gather round the tv set to watch her for a giggle once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish
she's a trend setter it's her profession
she's a drag a wellknown drag we turn the sound down on her and say rude things
get him out of here
have i said something amiss?
that's not your grandfather
so you surviving without me?
it is y'know
but your grandfather lives in your house i've seen him
you see he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher
a butcher?
gerron
aye and we'll have to watch it and all
aye but don't rush none of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff
now what's that supposed to mean?
did you look in here?
no i mean it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something
there's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts if that's what you mean if someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed
sure 
what's up?
ringo
oh listen to teacher's pet
eh i don't know if you realise it but 
we do
yes your grandfather's stirred him up
he hasn't
yes he's filled his head with notions seemingly
oh there you are
well if it isn't the littlest mccaffrey  hey you break anything with that you buy it  sorry there must be something wrong with my eyes i keep thinking that's a fire department uniform
oh i'm sorry i must have made a mistake
you haven't you're just late  oh yes he's going to be very pleased with you
is he?
well  come on
oh paul you can't have your own way
come on auntie you're winning
that must have cost you a fortune in stamps ringo
should i say it?
i don't think that bit's right
how'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
really well let's have a look at what else was "in your blood" i always look forward to getting these they make such a nice collage for the bar "assistant director sales aspen snowmobile tours"
it's happened at last we've become a limited company
what are we waiting for?
morning  who's that little old man?
it's paul's grandfather
no i didn't you did 
well what happened?
hello he's not talking to me he's having a sulk
sorry
oh
well  go 'head do the next bit
didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge i need
go away you've spoilt it
are you supposed to be here?
i've got you worried haven't i?
i'm warning you they'll be back in a minute
d'you know something "they" don't worry me at all anyroad i only fancy listening to you  that's all but if it worries you  well 
you're from liverpool aren't you?
how'd you guess?
oh it's the way you talk
is it  is it really?
are you pulling my leg?
uh huh and "pioneer's pride mobile log cabins" that was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
something like that
i see  do you like the play?
yeah  i mean sure well i took it at school but i only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines like sounds different on a girl  yeah it's gear on a girl
gear?
aye the big hammer smashing
thank you
you don't half slam the door in people's faces do you? i mean what about when you're playing the part like hundreds of people'll see you and 
i'm not 
oh you're the understudy sort of thing?
no  i'm a walkon in a fancy dress scene i just felt like doing those lines
there are two bodies found at this point
management were pin heads
oh i see you are an actress though aren't you?
yes
aye i knew you were
what's that mean?
well the way you were spouting like   "i don't believe you sir" and all that yeah it was gear
the big hammer?
oh aye a sledge
but the way you did it then sounded so phony
but that's not like a real person at all
aye well actresses aren't like real people are they?
"laguna jamming custom surfboards"?
they ought to be
oh i don't know anyroad up they never are are they?
what are you?
i'm in a group  well  there are four of us we play and sing
i bet you don't sound like real people
we do you know we sound like us having a ball it's fab
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
 all this and a jam butty too
i only enjoy acting for myself i hate it when other people are let in
why? i mean which are you scared or selfish?
coffee sucked
why selfish?
no hang on i've not gone daft you see when i was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery when i'd done she said to me "go and give some to the other kids" so i said i would but i thought to meself "she must think i'm soft" anyroad i was eating away there but i wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end i wound up giving it all away  but i didn't mind mind 'cos i'd made the stuff in the first place well  that's why you need other people an audience  to taste your treacle toffee like eh  does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
not really but i'm probably not a toffee maker how would you do those lines of mine?
well look at it this way i mean when you come right down to it that girl she's a bit of a scrubber isn't she?
is she?
of course  look if she was a liverpool scrubber   eh fella you want to try pulling the other one it's got a full set of bells hanging off it  y'what?  i know your sort two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway you're just after me body and y'can't have it  so there
and you honestly think that's what she meant?
well it's nice to know you think we're clever
and cunning
and what do you do about it?
and just this year "brian's sound spectrum" your own company even big step
me? oh i don't have the time i'm always running about with the lads  no we don't have the time
pity
aye it is but as long as you get by it's all right you know  bash on happy valley's when they let you stop anyroad i'd better get back
yes
see you
ah
will you ever look at him sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book
well  what's the matter with that?
have you no natural resources of your own? have they even robbed you of that?
you can learn from books
i was ahead of my time
can you now? aah  sheeps' heads you learn more by getting out there and living
out where?
any old where  but not our little richard  oh no when you're not thumping them pagan skins you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish
books are good
parading's better
parading?
that's it parading the streets  trailing your coat  bowling along  living
well i <u>am</u> living aren't i?
you're living are you? when was the last time you gave a girl a pinkedged daisy? when did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
eh  you're a bit old for that sort of chat aren't you?
who's going to die?
at least i've a backlog of memories but all you've got is that book
aaah  stop picking on me you're as bad as the rest of them
so you <u>are</u> a man after all
what's that mean?
do you think i haven't noticed  do you think i wasn't aware of the drift? oh  you poor unfortunate scuff they've driven you into books by their cruel unnatural treatment exploiting your good nature
oh  i dunno
and that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you  and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat i'd like to know
yeah  that's right
and what's it all come to in the end?
yeah  what's in it for me?
brian he's not doing it right dad he never does it right
a book
when you could be out there betraying a rich american widow or sipping palm wine in tahiti before you're too old like me a fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the friday queue at the post office
yeah  funny really 'cos i'd never thought of it but being middleaged and old takes up most of your time doesn't it?
you're only right
where are you off to?
ringo me old scout they grabbed yer leg for the iron too did they?
well i'm not exactly a voluntary patient
shush have they roughed you up yet?
what?
keep your voice down this lot'll paste you just for the exercise oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you
your brother's right if you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned
have they?
that sergeant's a bodyblow veteran if ever i measured one one of us has got to escape i'll get the boys hold on son i'll be back for you
me
and if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket
oh they seem all right to me

you see  you know your trouble  you should have gone west to america you'd have wound up a senior citizen of boston as it is you took the wrong turning and what happened you're a lonely old man from liverpool
oh no you're not you've gone too far this time  and who's paying for all this?
it's all taken care of it's down on our bill
and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars
all right how about ringo? i mean  he's very upset you know  and as far as your girlfriend little audrey's concerned she's finished with men for the rest of her natural and another thing 
a harmless bit of fun aah none of you have any sense of humour left these days

oh for pete's sake it's only a joke
anything to spare?

like what?
let's go and muck in
you won't interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality will you girl?
behave
what's he know?

well yes your nose is very
is it?
i would have said so
aye but you know him well
no i don't he's only a casual acquaintance
that's what you tell me
what have you heard?
it's all over the place everyone knows
is it? is it really?
mind you i stood up for you i mean i wouldn't have it
you know you can't do that  c'mon
you can't talk about my brother like that
i knew i could rely on you
you're a window rattler son
it'll only get you into trouble
he's betrayed the class
oh leave off
temper temper
that's right it's always me isn't it?
well
well look after him i don't want to find you've lost him
and?
stephen what are you doing here?
your grandfather pointed out shake was always being taller than me just to spite me
i knew it <u>he</u> started it i should have known
y'what?
have <u>you</u> lost him?
don't exaggerate
eh where's my grandfather?
don't worry about him he can look after himself
i've got the stuff come here
aren't we 
where's my grandfather?
fixing my roof
he belongs to paul
none for me then?
that's mine
well 
oh dear i feel like doing a bit of work
stop picking on him
what do you think are you're up to?
look after him
but
do i have to raise me voice?
where's sean?
yeah you want to watch it
it's not my fault
well you stick to that story son
i'm sorry norm but i can't help being taller than you
he's been gone a long time
who?
paul's grandfather
oh i didn't notice where'd he go?
down the  er 
oh down the  er ?
he's got piano lessons
yeah down the  er 
oh they've probably gone to the canteen cup of tea like
he's out there somewhere causing trouble just to upset me
you're imagining it you're letting things prey on your mind
oh no this is a battle of nerves between john and me
but john hasn't got any
what?
nerves
i'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance
 as they head up for the show oh yes well i mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show wouldn't it like
oh yeah? how's he doing?
how's that?
course he can talk he's a human being like isn't he?
"the management of boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of mr richard starkey that's you in their recently refinished gaming rooms chemin de fer baccarat roulette and champagne buffet" blimey
oh he's gone to my club has he?
what's the matter with you? you were bashing away like a madman
eh i thought you were looking after the old man
put it this way he's mislaid him
you can't trust you with anything norm if you've lost him i'll cripple you
eh what's all this?
shove the gentleman jockey in the makeup room or something and keep your eye on him will you?
he's going to be a fireman
i'm an electrician not a wet nurse y'know
i'll set john on you
what is he?
i've got a little list here wandering abroad malicious intent acting in a suspicious manner conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace you name it he's done it
oh a little savage is he?
so you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good
yeah but he insisted on us bringing him to the station
oh god am i cold
is that you roby?
i feel like shit
give up babe you can't fight it believe me my mom tried
i'm going to buy a cattle ranch
cattle ranch
if there is some kind of alien intelligence down on that planetoid it'd be a serious mistake for us to blunder in unequipped
hell we're equipped 
locked
engines off
good  maybe we'll be able to see something then
there could be a whole city out there and we'd never see it
are you in pain?
dell what's the last thing you can remember?
stephen you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this
 i don't know
do you remember the pyramid?
where's irth?
i don't recognize that constellation
i got it  oh boy
where the hell are we?
can you get it a little closer?
any rotation?
yeah  two hours
gravity?
i just wanted to i don't know not exactly apologize for the other night  especially since i don't remember much of it 
except it will take 75 years to get a reply back  don't forget how far we are from the colonies martin
dell i want greater magnification more surface detail  i want to see what this place looks like
activate lifter quads
approaching point of origin  closing at 20 kilometers 15 and slowing ten  five  gentlemen we are directly above the source of the transmission
what's the terrain down there?
well line of sight is impossible due to dust  radar gives me noise sonar gives me noise  infrared  noise  let's try ultraviolet  there flat  it's totally flat  a plain
is it solid?
it's basalt  rock
then take her down
close enough to walk to
is it drug related?
 you remember
i'm sending  do you hear me?
appears to be a door hanging open the entrance is clogged with debris
looks like a derelict
i'll go first
just machinery
this is chaz
chaz this is dell  can you come topside for a minute?
what's up?
well the sun just came up again and it seems the wind's died down it's as clear as a bell outside there's something i think you ought to see
what is it?
yeah i just thought i should say i don't know something
i was scanning the horizon to see what i could pick up  look there on that screen
maybe we can get in by the top
you want to try?
can we come up?
no it's too small only room enough for one person
dell you want to come down we can figure out where to go from here
okay i'm in the mouth of the chimney now and i'm starting down
are you okay in there?
yeah i'm okay  haven't hit bottom yet  definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust
what was that dell i lost you do you read me?
the great communicator
how do you feel dell?
wretched  what happened to me?
don't you remember?
hell you're in great shape you've got your sense of humor back
i'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
what's wrong?
breathe deeply
computer this is captain standard what conditions are you talking about?
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin
a transmission?
sorry i hit jackson
i have recorded the transmission
computer what language was that?
just <u>hold it</u> <u>hold it</u>  computer: have you attempted to analyze the transmission?
i have interrupted the course of the voyage
what?  <u>why</u>?
unknown  what do you mean?
yes
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor 
computer  i've turned all the cooling units back on  what's wrong?
just a minute hold it i'm checking
he deserved it he was born deserving it
how long to fix?
hard to say
well get started
hello faust
yeah
<u>he</u> died
what?
sorry to interrupt but i'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute okay?
yes?  what is it?
jay we've got a problem  i was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability
he treats you okay?
why what's wrong?
the computer's translated the alien signal and it's kind of alarming
what do you mean?
you like this shit?
it grows on you
you know what they make this stuff out of?
yes i know what they make it out of so what?  it's food now  <u>you're</u> eating it
but we can't kill it  if we kill it it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space
we could cut a section out of that metallite netting  it won't hold up to that acid but aside from that it's pretty strong
where's it coming from?
okay
okay
what happened to the lights?
where does that go?
what happened?  where's sandy?
dead
dead
it's monstrous  it grew like some horrible tapeworm  we were completely unprepared
what the hell's going on?
don't know  broussard got hurt somehow
hurt  how?
i treated you better
oh  god  oh 
boy do i feel a lot better  it's a straight shot back to the colonies and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt  any bets on the top bid?
oh no  oh no
and then we run out of food and oxygen
that one section of the ventilator shaft has only two outlets  you notice?  the food storage room on one end 
well uh good luck  i hope you won't need me but if you do i'm here
martin this is jay  the intakes are clogged with dust  we overheated and burned out a whole cell
jay how's it coming on the repairs?
well i'm going to have to blow the engines out
and when will you be ready to do that?
you want some coffee?
oh  i'm not near ready yet
then why the hell are you sitting around here?
it's really on there tight
hey guess what?
what?
this dust is getting clogged in the intakes again
oh it's okay  i've had better cag than this but i've had worse too if you know what i mean
so does anybody have any suggestions?
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship  that would kill it
might even incinerate the damn thing
coffee? nah i gotta go
it's clear
it looks completely different from the first one  it's more like a worm with legs and tentacles
so it's trapped in between  now we have to drive it out
hey are you guys still there? what's going on?
meet us on the bridge  be careful  it's <u>huge</u> now
there's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge  i'll go get it
no i don't want us separated
all right but do <u>not</u> go below decks
right 
he wouldn't open the lock; he was going to leave us out there
detective  can you tell us what happened here?
what's wrong stephen?  c'mon you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind  how's brian doing?
where did it come from?
<u>he's</u> the only one that knows that
blood's thoroughly oxygenated
we can't expect to understand a life form like this  we're out of our back yard  things are different here
well can't we kill it?  i mean we can't leave the damn thing on him
we don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it  at least right now it's keeping him alive
god that smoke's poisonous
i never saw anything like that in my life except molecular acid
but this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>
it makes me sick to see him like that
he's out
it's a crude symbolic language  looks primitive
we can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose
it's over hunter
boy that's terrific
that thing god almighty didn't you try to get it off him?
hey now what is this?
there  should be coming through about there
i'll do it  the rest of you continue
you know it's fantastic  the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form and now we run into a veritable zoo
what do you mean?
i know he's out but how's he doing?
well those things out there aren't the same you know  the spaceship and the pyramid  they're from different cultures and different races  that ship just landed here  crashed like we did  the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous
how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  it's dead
now we're in for it
no don't open the door  we don't want it escaping
well what the hell good can we do in here?  we can't grab it  it might jump on us 
yes?
how's broussard?
he's running a fever
still unconscious?
yes
y'know i treated him better than any other probie i ever had he probably hates my guts but i did the best thing for him i made him finally look in the mirror
can you do anything for him?
the machine will bring his temperature down  his vital functions are strong
i think i could cobble something together  a long metal rod with a battery in it  give it a hell of a shock
don't worry it won't damage it it'll just give it a little incentive
maybe we don't have to  it's trapped in there  we could just leave it in there all the way back to irth
we can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit  it'll flood the whole ship
while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net
sounds like a rough one
we'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there 
listen it sure didn't like this flamethrower
ah stephen that's what this is really about isn't it? you always have to be right
that's right  we can't kill it on the ship but we can at least keep it at bay  and maybe drive it into the air lock
we've got six hours left
oh my god
oh no  we can't fight this thing there's only six hours of air left  we're dead men
i don't buy that  there's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers
<u>how</u>?
if we could just get the <u>creature</u> into the lifeboat we could launch it into space and blow it up
good  that's good
you can't say that; i think it's a good plan
the flamethrower needs more fuel
hey i'm the first one to admit when i'm wrong
the ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back
should we go outside and bring him in?
it will be
well now we have to herd that thing up here
it must have stopped moving  i'm not getting anything
the flamethrower
now what's wrong?
i've completely lost their signal
can you get them back?
what?  what was that?
yeah? when was the last time?
i'm getting nowhere  the whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission  i think we should go after them
no
what do you mean no?
we're not going anywhere
but they don't know about the translation  they could be in danger right now
we can't spare the personnel  we've got minimum takeoff capability right now  that's why chaz left us on board
why you chickenshit bastard 
i've got 'em  they're back on my screens
how many?
oh no
in a fire? never  look i'm his brother i care about him y'know? he was going to get himself killed maybe not today maybe not in a year but it would've happened and i couldn't  i just couldn't
i keep my mouth pretty much shut but i don't like hitting
look at that
what is it  i can't tell anything 
it's some kind of organ  it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat
i think that's how it's getting oxygen to him
what's happening up here?
this is horrible
that must have been when he got it
what common objects?
you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
i'm sorry i couldn't sleep
don't count on it
recognizable  in that?
in symbolic form very stylized but if you stare at it you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with
well i suppose that starshaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard  is that what you mean?
 and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle
we can't kill it on board  it's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body
blow the ship up?
what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  that's the only reason we came out here we'd have to abandon them all  we'd be broke
i think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat
we can use the flamethrower
what's wrong?
this should do it
isn't "bait" the word you used?
just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship that's all
is it armed?
if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off
sandy you want to give us some vision?
first contact
sandy can you home in on that beam?
what's the frequency?
i've got it  it's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds declination 39 degrees 2 seconds
i understand but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you  is this somehow related to the fire department?
cook and i are almost finished here have a seat
well we can't go anywhere in this darkness  how long till dawn?
just settle down  sandy you get any response yet?
receiving
that way
what's wrong?
it's close real close
how far?
air lock?
doesn't seem much doubt about it does there?
this looks ancient
look i'm sorry i 
what'd he say?
if we don't hear from him soon i think we better go in after him
here's his line  we can haul him out of there if we have to
it'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it  the line could get tangled in something
but what can we do?  he's out of radio contact
there it caught
is it still coming up or is it hooked on something?
no it's coming
<u>what is it</u>?
oh god oh god no
 no that's okay it's just sean
it won't come  it's stuck
what is it?
it's not coming off  not without his whole face coming off too
it's stopped?
yes thank heaven
we're just plain lucky  that could have gone right through the hull  taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it
no thank god just missed him
is it still dripping?
that sounds a little fanciful
too primitive  it's a pre technological construction  that slab was engineered by an ironage culture at best
 he's gettin' good on those eggs and y'know he told me he actually likes the piano
we're going home  we're in hyperspace
i'm going to write a book about this expedition  i'm going to call it "the snark log"
the commander normally has first publication rights
we'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship
well i kind of hate to point it out but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation and as you know we used up most of that time in harvesting
how?
and what do we do when we find it?
i thought i'd find you here
i was thinking of a line from an old poem: "water water everywhere but not a drop to drink"  all that space out there and we're trapped in this ship
that's the one about the albatross right?
they ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors it's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum burns almost completely away when you light it
we can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust  we are utterly absolutely alone  can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  halfway across creation
we came out there we'll go back  a long time by the clock but a short time to us
time and space have no meaning out here  we're living in einsteinian equation
i can see you're putting your spare time to good use  let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough they'll be peeling you off a wall  i've seen it happen
we're the new pioneers chaz  we even have our own special diseases
i've got hunter and something else as well in front of him
are they close?
they're on the next level up
they're getting pretty close now
all right then  when it gets to the other side of the door you sing out then drop the door  okay?
putty? on both doors?
okay
men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe  this is an opportunity which may never come again
my god it's stormy for a piece of rock that size
source of transmission is to the northeast about 300 meters
it appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort it blocks the xrays
that tube must be depositing it in him
these day and night cycles are totally disorienting  i feel like we've been here for days but it's only been how long?
we do know that
yeah?
no  it's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites  if there were a native ecology it would have to be microscopic
anyway down here take a look
first thing i'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food
what's the matter you don't like this stuff?
all right tycoons let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand
where are we?
this is chaz speaking  sorry but we are not home  our present location seems to be only halfway to irth remain at your posts and stand by that is all
chaz i've got something here on my security alert  a high priority from the computer
let's hear it
oh my god
it's out of focus
atmospheric turbulence  dust storm
see that patch of shirt? we wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro on a lucky shot we picked up some traces of trychticholorate nobody around here had ever heard of it
what the hell happened?
yeah okay 
10% argon 85% nitrogen 5% neon and some trace elements
nontoxic but unbreathable pressure?
ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter
good  moisture content?
zero  dry as a bone
any microorganisms?
not a one  it's dead
anything else?
trychticholorate? alright it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents it's pretty rare they stopped making it a couple'a years ago
yeah rock particles  dust
okay chaz i hear you  i've got you on my board
martin uh we've found it
found what?
martin?
i agree  this is the single most important discovery in history
but?
find anything we missed?
i don't even know what i'm looking for
still worried?
probably got in cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire
oh well you know me
what would you say that was supposed to mean?
well it's obviously intentional some kind of attempt at communication maybe it's a symbol that means something to them
this ship is full of cat hair
hey can you guys hear me?
yeah we hear you  we're coming back
thank christ  we lost you  listen there's been a new development 
here chaz
we're coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz  what happened to broussard?
i really can't give out any information right now at this point
what the hell was it doing in the fire?
you hear me martin?  open the outer door
chaz if it's an organism and we let it in the ship will be infected
we can't leave him out here open the door
chaz listen to me  we've broken every rule of quarantine  if we bring an organism on board we won't have a single layer of defense left
i understand why you did that
would somebody fill me in?
what film?
look at these suckers  no wonder we couldn't get it off him
i'm sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place martin  we never should have landed here
look i'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything  the important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible
shadow
i can't lean on faust any harder  he's been working nonstop on the engines
where did the parasites come from?
take us up
engaged
we made it  damn we made it
you bet we made it  martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive
that's the part that always makes me feel like i'm gonna puke  when we accelerate into light speed
i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is  it'll arrest the progress of his disease and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies
we'll have to go into quarantine maybe for quite a while
we won't need it then
how ya doin' ronald staying comfortable?
all right so that's what we've got a week  it's plenty of time
these will be very useful  at least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands  all right here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship  whoever finds it first catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock  clear?
yes
we've got it up here  it's trapped get up here fast
where are you?
foodstorage room
what's it doing having a seizure?
it started crashing around right after we locked it in
now what?
hey wait a minute  that's all our food supplies in there  we can't pump poison gas all over them
didn't think you'd make it
once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more  we can go straight into hypersleep  also it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all
this stuff's deadly  i hope we know what we're doing
now what?
are you <u>crazy</u>?
so the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
that's a flipflop gate to channel the air but we can use it to trap the thing
how did it get so <u>big</u>?
two down four to go
what's that supposed to mean?
can you make out any pattern in all that?
wouldn't miss this for the world pal
well yes there's a pattern but it's meaningless to me
that next thing there  six legs tentacles  that's the thing we saw in the food locker
this is all the same creature  we're seeing the different stages in its lifecycle
which presumably means
i saw it  faust got himself jammed in the air lock door  his body held it open
can we get to him?
poor kitty; puss puss puss
at least we're rid of the damn monster  it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship
it was time for that a couple days ago
let's hear it
who's this?
okay  first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines
that'll blow the ship up
but the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed
no it won't work and i just realized why  there's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat only one of us could survive
yeah i forgot
you know it's funny  this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up  this treasure the paydirt  it'll make it back to irth just fine  even if we're not with it
<u>hey watch it</u>
so what do we do?  do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat  or do we flush it out now?
yes and maybe launch the boat and blow it too if the others are injured
all right martin we'll be in touch with you on the communicator
he works for me
and you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way
and you stand aside while we drive it in then shut the hatch launch the boat and 
kill me
what did it do to you?
that was melkonis it ate hunter
i'll get you out of there
no don't
but i can save you  get you to the autodoc
no good it's eaten too much of me
what can i do?
is he a fireman?  i like firemen
headache?  dehydration?
the head's okay but i could sink a sixpack
can i um have some water?  please?
what is it?
it's nothing doc  just a touch of indigestion something
better?
me either  i tell you i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto and when something like that hits believe me you know about it
nada no radiation no movement nothing
it's a rhino
is it dead?
you don't know him
yeah it's fine
god i hope that thing didn't bring down a virus
looks like a spore  fungus of some kind maybe?
let's get back and call this in
nice howitzer you've got there
thanks
good argument for guncontrol  what are you going after rhino?
we've got no option  we're gonna have to get it off
minh
that's the second time i ran it and it still reads the same
knock it off now
a pair of incomings  they poppedup on the mediumrange about thirteen twentyfour local time
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a backtrace just to make sure
can you patch me a temporary loop on dcmgs?
what do you need?
a threesecond burn to port on my mark
seal everything now
what's happening?
cassie thank christ  we're under attack
how many of them are there?
give or take
okay  but i do understand that your partner leon jackson's been injured is that correct?
tell him about me shadow?
are you alright?
where is she?
comin' up the central reservoir
i found it
and?
drains right into the central reservoir
i can't reach her  too much signal breakup
marsco went bellyup on the dow jones
shit  when?
fucking great  i invested some money in them
ronald here likes telephones used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton came up with a whole little thing there didn't you ronald? when you got bored what did you do? you just started making calls mostly day care centers and retirement homes wasn't it?
you win some you loose some
i lose 'em all that's why i'm still out here on this rock  anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
curious thing is the mass detector says they're too small to carry a deepspace drive
where're they headed?
when?
seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour  those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort
picking up velocity
what's going on?
the door's sealed from inside  doc revna's in there and it sounds like ackland's going nuts
it's too late
did he tell you how we finally met?
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far but the numbers are all over the place
autoshop's sealed but those boys are cutoff
has anybody talked to them?
not yet
oh man
how much airtime have i got?
about thirty minutes  those are slimmeddown tanks so no stopping to admire the scenery
deal
if i can get to the chopper i'll meet you at the rendezvous  don't wait for me
c'mon man  one more sweep
nobody cares ronald
one more sweep one more sweep  i'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep we're been lookin' for this thing for three days now and found zip
ah quit griping  keeps you in shape doesn't it?
listen to what?
de vries?
yeah?
something spooking the rhinos?
hey guttierez?
what?
one of 'em must have escaped
there's no way a rhino'd survive that drop
sure ronald? you're ready alright
goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies
whoa wait a minute
what?
what?  are you nuts?  just the two of us?
i've seen this mother de vries  we can bag it no problem
forget it man
c'mon de vries  think of the bonus
what the hell are you doing?
alright okay  look
what?
 burn them
but i'm going first
careful of that edging there
still got him?
hold it hold it
what's wrong?
what?  where?
can't see a thing  are you sure?
wait  lost it
how?
oh man  that's no glitch
and old ladies?
it's alright it's cool
is it still moving?
move it baby or they're gonna be chewin' on my cojones
miss noguchi  you're wanted in admin
what happened?
secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system  i found the grating ripped right off  the little fucker was strong
nobody wander off on their own until it's found  keep in pairs diller once the first team's done their sweep i want you to go down with annie to threepump while she replaces it
okay
shit  our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores  we got about two clips left for an autoloader and that's it
that sounds promising  can we operate the crane from here?
 burn them
nah  it's got programmable facilities but it was never rigged for remote operation  someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running
is this the suit?
yeah i stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pickups too  that's also on the display
we had to  they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate  besides all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference anyway  maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick
hey jan  see if you can get someone to check out the chopper
what's the problem?
she was running a little sluggish on the way back  think the turbines might be playing up
give me twenty minutes and i'll do it myself
and?
that's what we thought
and the world  the whole world
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to crossreff them through?
fort powell  what do we tell 'em?
already working on it
they've changed their heading again
compensate
it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here
central pumping  all the waste gets  treated brokendown and flushed out into the swamp  if it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked out
everything on this module is locked and sealed  we've lost 'b' 'c' and 'e' wings but 'e' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate
they knocked out the external feeds
communications to autoshop go through an fo link off the main trunk that's down with the other feeds
got a cause?
it's not all good news  we had to take off the helmet lights  you'll be going in blind
there's still time to backout
thanks
let's just run through it one more time so i know you've got it straight
sorry  two green enabling buttons
okay we're in business
okay i'm out of here
see that sheathing on the suspension? eaten away  same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers  the algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics
hey boss  wondered where you'd gotten to
i just wanted to be put on my own for a while  clear my head
you did what?
he was hurt but not seriously  he'll be fine
are the glory boys actually showing interest in investigation's work? i may have a stroke
i've got a lot of thinking to do  'sides the room was getting too crowded for me
not too much of the socializing type then?
i'm serious  that's why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations
is that a fact
uhhuh  used to get it pretty bad  i'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch
how long you been out here for now anyway?  three months?
four
and before that?
six month stint on datus
only six?
i'm working on it
what is this?  'twenty questions'?
what is that?
seltzer?
any luck raising ackland's party?
nothing  with the satellite down we can't transmit over the mountain range he's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us
first light we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back
'we'?  you wanna fly out there with me?
don't worry about it  if the network goes by the book like everyone figures they will a marine gunboat from powell'll dropby for a look see in fourorfive days  they can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us  all we've gotta do is sit tight
do you think ackland'll sit tight?
yeah  somebody won
i deal with this stuff every day but a fireman you never get used to it  what happened up there? he was a candidate did he pay attention? was he listening?
i've found ackland
i'm going to need you to cosign the report  until we come up with something this'll be treated as first degree murder
agreed
when we get the link back and i send this in icc'll throw a fit
ah don't worry about icc  they're the least of your problems right now
think i spoke too soon
do you believe him?
cornering it shouldn't be a problem  each part of this station is basically a selfsufficient deepspace transport module running off external couplers  if we disconnect them and seal off every section we've got a ceiling of about thirtysix hours on internal power  that should give us ample time to find it
so what do you think?
what?
he wasn't listening to the right thing
that's the wrong way
hurry it up
theythey snapped my legs to fit fit me in here  i don'tremember what happened next
what can i do?
i can feel it moving around inside me you've got to kill me
i i can't
you have to
where'd you leave them?
jesus
yeah exactly  those're preprogrammed course adjustments you're looking at
what do you listen to stephen?
how's it going?
today's party's finished their sweep the relief team's out there now everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the autoshop
you should hit the sack too
nah i'll stick it out for another hour or so
what time's sundown?
'bout five minutes
give me a yell is something happens
hello there who are you?
miss harrington's resting mr dewitt she asked me to see who it is
how do you know my name?
you don't know nobody knows
it's a very famous name mr dewitt
and what is your name?
phoebe
phoebe?
i call myself phoebe
may i come in?
certainly mr dewitt
i expected to find this little room overcrowded with a theater full of people at your feet
of course your performance was no surprise to me after the other day i regarded it as no more than  a promised fulfilled
you're more than kind but it's still miss channing's performance i'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original
it knows us this one knows us
you're more than modest
it's not modesty i just don't try to kid myself
a revolutionary approach to the theater however if i may a suggestion
please do
i think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility it is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly
i don't think i've done anything to sound off about
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns if we don't blow them  who will?
even so one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy it'll be forgotten tomorrow
it needn't be
even if i wanted to  as you say  be less humble blow my own horn how would i do it? i'm less than nobody
alderman swayzak
after you change if you're not busy elsewhere we can have supper
i'd love to or should i pretend i'm busy?
let's have a minimum of pretending i'll want to do a column about you
i'm not enough for a paragraph
 perhaps more than one there's so much i want to know i've heard your story in bits and pieces your home in wisconsin your tragic marriage your financial attachment to margo  it started in san francisco didn't it?  i say  your idolatry of margo started in san francisco didn't it?
that's right
san francisco an oasis of civilization in the california desert tell me do you share my high opinion of san francisco?
yes i do
and that memorable night when margo first dazzled you from the stage  which theater was it in san francisco? was it  the shubert?
yes the shubert
investigator rimgale
a fine old theater the shubert full of tradition untouched by the earthquake  so sorry  fire by the way what was your husband's name?
eddie
i'm about to go into the shower i won't be able to hear you
i can wait where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night
you take charge
hungry?
just some coffee
i'm not surprised after all that humble pie
nothing of the kind karen and i had a nice talk
heart to heart? woman to woman? including a casual reference to the part of "cora"  and your hopes of playing it
inspector
i discussed it very openly i told her that i had spoken to lloyd  and that he was interested
she mentioned of course that margo expects to play the part?
just like that eh?
just like that
i don't think that's funny
it wasn't meant to be
i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone i've ever known to say a thing like that now  without any reason  when i need you more than ever
what a day  what a heavenly day
dday
just like it
do you have the suspect in custody?
when are you going to catch the prick that's doing this don?
and tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of immortality
stop rehearsing your column isn't it strange addison? i thought i'd be panicstricken want to run away or something instead i can't wait for tonight to come to come and go
are you that sure of tomorrow?
aren't you?
it'll be a night to remember it'll bring to me everything i've ever wanted the end of an old road  and the beginning of a new one
all paved with diamonds and gold?
you know me better than that
paved with what then?
what time?
almost four
"don?"
plenty of time for a nice long nap  we rehearsed most of last night
you could sleep too couldn't you?
the mark of a true killer  sleep tight rest easy  and come out fighting
why'd call me a killer?
suites are for expense accounts aren't you being extravagant?
also with the reluctant compliments of max fabian
lloyd i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish  so he sent it up
some plain soda  lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven
that's for tonight you're invited we're having everyone up after the performance
we're?
don't you have any leads at all?
addison
she's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her
addison just a few minutes ago when i told you this would be a night to remember  that it would bring me everything i wanted
 something about an old road ending and a new one starting  paved with stars
i didn't mean just the theater
so that's it lloyd still just the theater after all
it's nothing of the kind lloyd loves me i love him
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves  i leave those to louisa may alcott but i do know you
i'm in love with lloyd
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america
we still haven't found a connection between the victims
you have no right to say such things
addison won't it be just perfect? lloyd and i  there's no telling how far we can go he'll write great plays for me i'll make them be great  you're the only one i've told the only one that knows except lloyd and me
 and karen
i see and when was this unholy alliance joined?
we decided the night before last before we came up here
was the setting properly romantic  the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage?
the setting wasn't romantic but lloyd was he woke me up at three in the morning banging on my door  he couldn't sleep he told me  he's left karen he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until i promised to marry him we sat and talked until it was light he never went home
you sat and talked until it was light
we sat and talked addison i want a run of the play contract
there never was there'll never be another like you
jesus open your eyes seagrave cosgrove and now holcomb  fried in a goddamn highrise
what do you take me for?
i don't know what i take you for anything
it is possible  even conceivable  that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on  that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
i'm sure you mean something by that addison but i don't know what
look closely eve it's time you did i am addison dewitt i'm nobody's fool least of all  yours
i never intended you to be
i still don't know what you're getting at right now i want to take my nap it's important that i
 it's important right now that we talk killer to killer
champion to champion
not with me you're no champion you're stepping way up in class
is there a connection between them alderman?
addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly  and then get out so i can take my nap
very well plainly and distinctly although i consider it unnecessary  because you know as well as i what i am about to say  lloyd may leave karen but he will not leave karen for you
what do you mean by that?
more plainly and more distinctly? i have not come to new haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd  or anyone else  because i will not permit it
what have you got to do with it?
everything because after tonight you will belong to me
i can't believe my ears
a dull cliche
belong  to you? that sound medieval  something out of an old melodrama
so does the history of the world for the past twenty years i don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this frankly i had hoped that you would somehow have known  have taken it for granted that you and i
mr swayzak how ya doin'?
you're too short for that gesture besides it went out with mrs fiske
your name is not eve harrington it is gertrude slescynski
what of it?
it is true that your parents were poor they still are and they would like to know how you are  and where they haven't heard from you for three years
a matter of opinion granted it is also true that you worked in a brewery but life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it as a matter of fact it got less and less dull  until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives
she never proved anything not a thing
she was a liar she was a liar
i had to get in to meet margo i had to say something be somebody make her like me
she did like you she helped and trusted you you paid her back by trying to take bill away
that's not true
i'm a little busy right now 
you used my name and my column to blackmail karen into getting you the part of "cora"  and you lied to me about it
nonono
then say so
yes addison
and you realize  you agree how completely you belong to me?
yes addison
i won't play tonight  i couldn't not possibly i couldn't go on
i don't suppose there's a drink left
you can have one at max's
i don't think i'm going
i'm gonna need some bread man this ain't fair i'm always here for you and you can't even take decent care of me my landlord is bitching like a motherfucker you're two months behind on the rent lieutenant
why not?
because i don't want to
max has gone to a great deal of trouble it's going to be an elaborate party and it's for you
no it's not  it's for this
it's the same thing isn't it?
exactly  here take it to the party instead of me
i'm tired i want to go home
every now and then some elder statesman of the theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings
that isn't a waiter my dear that's a butler
well i can't yell "oh butler" can i? maybe somebody's name is butler
didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3500 a month is crazy man
you have a point an idiotic one but a point
let's go sit by the piano
we never met that's why
this must be at long last our formal introduction until now we have met only in passing
claudia dear come closer  this is max fabian he is a producer go do yourself some good
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
feeling better my dear?
like i just swam the english channel now what?
tell me this do they have auditions for television?
it is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in new york hollywood and london are no different from the good people of des moines chillicothe and liverpool by and large we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics egomaniacs emotional misfits and precocious children
umnow is not a good time okay detective jackson's hurt  he's fine i've got a fire marshall shot detective jackson is hurt but not seriously
brown downtown there hasn't been any smoking brown on the street in 
answer me this what makes a man become a producer?
what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
this answer satisfies me a hundred percent
in my case it's necessary too many taxi drivers write plays
i'm giving her a very highclass party it ain't like a rehearsal she don't have to be late
then stop being a star  start treating your guests as your supporting cast
she was magnificent
then you've heard too
i was there an eyewitness
you were there? at the play  last night?
i can't get over what those guys did to her i just can't
from the smartness of your dress i take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
margo
margo? lunching in public?
it's new margo but she's just as late as the old one
i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list what are you doing here?
dear margo you were an unforgettable peter pan  you must play it again soon you remember miss caswell?
eve this is an old friend of mr dewitt's mother  miss caswell miss harrington  addison i've been wanting you to meet eve for the longest time
it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it
you've heard of her great interest in the theater
we have that in common
they're alive aren't they? come on man everyone's making such a fucking fuss just because she's a nun just because she wears a penguin suit the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would
you mustn't worry about your little charge she is in safe hands
why so remote addison? i should think you'd be at the side of your protegee lending her moral support
miss caswell at the moment is where i can lend no support  moral or otherwise
the ladies'  shall we say  lounge?
being violently ill to her tummy
miss caswell got lucky too late the audition is over
over? it can't be i've come to read with her i promised max
the audition was called for 2:30 it is now nearly four
is it really? i must start wearing a watch i never do you know who read with miss caswell? bill?  lloyd?  well it couldn't have been max who?
naturally enough your understudy
susie's not a virgin anymore
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy eve harrington
eve my understudy
didn't you know?
of course i knew
how how was miss caswell?
frankly i don't remember
just slipped your mind
completely nor i am sure could anyone else present tell you how miss caswell read or whether miss caswell read or rode a pogo stick
margo as you know i have lived in the theater as a trappist monk lives in his faith i have no other world no other life  and once in a great while i experience that moment of revelation for which all true believers wait and pray you were one jeanne eagels another paula wessely hayes  there are others three or four eve harrington will be among them
it's horrible they burned her breasts with cigarettes christ
i take it she read well
it wasn't reading it was a performance brilliant vivid something made of music and fire
how nice
in time she'll be what you are
a mass of music and fire that's me an old kazoo and some sparkles tell me  was bill swept away too or were you too full of revelation to notice?
bill didn't say  but lloyd was beside himself he listened to his play as if someone else had written it he said it sounded so fresh so new so full of meaning
eve was incredibly modest she insisted that no credit was due her that lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them
the implication being that i have not been reading them as written
bill
the air lines have clocks even if you haven't i start shooting a week from monday  zanuck is impatient he wants me he needs me
the church is a fucking racket i know how they operate i've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head my aunt lu says i was crying all the way through yeah i know their game inside out now i'm free of it and i'm gonna stay that way
bill
huh?
you've already met
where?
right here a minute ago
good luck genius
macbeth
i guess at this point i'm what the french call 'de trop'
when? when are you going to do it?
nothing?
i'm not talking about the fucking church fuck the church but tell me do you believe in god?
fortyfive minutes from now my plane takes off and how do i find you? not ready yet looking like a junk yard
thank you so much
is it sabotage does my career mean nothing to you? have you no human consideration?
only in some ways you're prettier
hi  my wonderful junk yard the mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard
oh well   look through the wigs maybe it got caught
real diamonds in a wig the world we live in
can't keep his eyes off my legs
like a nylon lemon peel
she's quite a girl that what'sher name
what's to believe?
eve i'd forgotten they grew that way
the lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant?
i told her i sounded off
take care of yourself out there
i understand they've got the indians pretty well in hand
bill
huh?
don't get stuck on some glamour puss
i'll try
people
you're not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy
everybody can't be gregory peck
 you're a setup for some gorgeous wideeyed young babe
how childish are you going to get before you quit it?
i don't want to be childish i'd settle for just a few years
and cut that out right now
am i going to lose you bill? am i?
knit me a muffler
what a thoughtful everlovin' thing to do
bill? have i gone crazy bill?
you believe that man is the beall and endall?
you're my girl aren't you?
that i am
then you're crazy
when  when are you coming back?
i leave in a week  the picture's all wrapped up we previewed last night those previews like opening out of town but terrifying there's nothing you can do you're trapped you're in a tin can
 in a tin can cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket i want you home
you in a hurry?
a big hurry be quick about it  so good night darling and sleep tight
wait a minute you can't hang up you haven't even said it
bill you know how much i do  but over the phone now really that's kid stuff
eddie are you okay?
yeah
kid stuff or not it doesn't happen every day i want to heat it  and if you won't say it you can sing it
sing it?
bill bill it's your birthday
happy birthday darling
the reading could have been better but you said it  now "many happy returns of the day"
many happy returns of the day
i get a party don't i?
of course birthday and welcome home who'll i ask?
it's no secret i know all about the party  eve wrote me
she did?
it's not the drugs ariane it's  it's someone who wants to kill me  you gotta believe me
she hasn't missed a week since i left  but you know all that you probably tell her what to write anyway i sent her a list of people to ask  check with her
yeah i will
how is eve? okay?
okay
i love you
i'll check with eve
what?
i love you too good night darling
outside of a beehive margo your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly
it's a good thought
christ shit i could kill them all with my bare hands
happy little housewife
cut it out
need any help?
don't let me kill the point or isn't it a story for grownups?
you've heard it about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
looks like i'm going to have a very fancy party
i thought you were going to be late
when i'm guest of honor?
i had no idea you were even here
i ran into eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing
who?
that never stopped you before
well we started talking she wanted to know all about hollywood she seemed so interested
she's a girl of so many interests
it's a pretty rare quality these days
she's a girl of so many rare qualities
so she seems
i can't believe you're making this up  it sounds like something out of an old clyde fitch play
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time
i've always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousin' the night lincoln was shot
i don't think that's funny
c'mere you got some good blow right?
of course it's funny  this is all too laughable to be anything else you know what i think about this  this age obsession of yours  and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes with a stagestruck kid
twenty minutes
thirty minutes forty minutes what of it?
stagestruck kid she's a young lady  of qualities and i'll have you know i'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities studying me as if  as if i were a play or a set of blueprints how i walk talk think eat sleep
now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible
stop calling her a kid it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges
for instance what?
for instance  you
this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you  but i'm not going to i'm too mad
 guilty
yeah
mad darling there are certain characteristics for which you are famous  on stage and off i love you for some of them  and in spite of others i haven't let those become too important to me they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment  you've got to keep your teeth sharp all right but you will not sharpen them on me  or on eve
what about her teeth? what about her fangs?
she hasn't cut them yet and you know it so when you start judging an idealistic dreamyeyed kid by the barroom benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society  i won't have it eve harrington has never by word look thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love and to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me  it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of
thank you
nothing really
the kid  junior that is  will be right down unless you'd like to take her drink up to her
many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body where has it been laid out?
it hasn't been laid out we haven't finished with the embalming as a matter of fact you're looking at it the remains of margo channing sitting up it is my last wish to be buried sitting up
wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
you know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural
first i'll put your uptown in the spoon then to make it more exciting i'm gonna add some downtown they call this thing a speedball honey but then you must know that  first time shooting up?
then without feeling your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the  shall we say happier side?
no heart to burn
it's all over
what's all over?
the audition
what fire and music?
addison
and you i take it are the paderewski who plays his concerto on me the piano?  where is princess fireandmusic?
who?
the kid junior
nah
gone
i must have frightened her away
i wouldn't be surprised sometimes you frighten me
poor little flower just dropped her petals and folded her tent
don't mix your metaphors
i mix what i like
okay mix
i'm nothing but a body with a voice no mind
what a body what a voice
the exship news' reporter no body no voice all mind
can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? he kills people for fun and then he puts up 100 g to bring in some guys who raped a nun what a sick fuck man
the gong rang the fight's over calm down
i will not calm down
don't calm down
you're being terribly tolerant aren't you?
i'm trying terribly hard
well you needn't i will not be tolerated and i will not be plotted against
here we go
such nonsense what do you all take me for  little nell from the country? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing carefully hidden no doubt
now don't get carried away
 shows up for an audition when everyone knew i'd be here and gives a performance out of nowhere  gives a performance
who?
you've been all through that with lloyd
the playwright doesn't make the performance  and it doesn't just happen and this one didn't  full of fire and music and whatnot it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt over and over full of those bill sampson touches
i am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts
paranoiac
i didn't know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon
no i'll tell it to you for the last time i'll tell it to you because you've got to stop hurting yourself and me and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums
that word again i don't even know what it means
it's obvious you're not a woman
i've been aware of that for some time
well i am
yeah  now's not a good time
but you could do it baby we could use the bread
i'll say
don't be condescending
come on get up i'll buy you a drink
i admit i may have seen better days but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail  like a salted peanut
margo let's make peace
the terms are too high unconditional surrender
just being happy? just stopping all this nonsense about eve  and eve and me?
it's not nonsense
but if i tell you it is  as i just did were you listening to me?  isn't that enough?
i wish it were
i got it man i will find those kids and i'll get the 50 g from the church then the kids'll go to jail i'll be in charge of course after a little while i'll break the fuckers out  and i'll turn them in to shithead i was just talking to and pick up his 100 g no i'll hit him up for 200 g or 250 g l can do it  'cause i've got the kids then of course there's the 180 g i'm gonna pick up on the game tonight  when the strawberries win
then what would be enough?  if we were married?
i wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something
you've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me margo tell me what's behind all this
i  i don't know bill just a feeling i don't know
bill   where are you going? to find eve?
the socalled art of acting is not one for which i have a particularly high regard
hear hear
but you may quote me as follows quote tonight miss margo channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play the like of which i have never seen before and expect rarely to see again unquote
he does not exaggerate i was good
to margo to my bridetobe
"the strawberries"?
it's only for the license there's a threeday wait  blood tests things like that
something simple a fur coat over a nightgown
"please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion  but it's most important that i speak with you please"  it's underlined  "meet me in the ladies' room eve"
i understand she is now the understudy in there
groom   may i have a wedding present?
what would you like? texas?
there goes eve eve evil little miss evil but the evil that men do  how does it go groom? something about the good they leave behind  i played it once in rep in wilkes barre
you've got it backwards even for wilkesbarre
never try to outguess margo
groom
how come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the church haven't come up with shit? you got some kinda inside track?
yes dear
you know what i'm going to be?
a cowboy
a married lady
with the paper to prove it
often enough to keep the franchise
hello what's your name?
you said fortyseven minutes you'll never make it
why?
i just wondered
you took the chalice
just wondered what?
why
why what?
why you have to go out there
i don't have to i want to
is it the money?
eighty percent of it will go for taxes
then why? why if you're the best and most successful young director in the theater
the theatuh the theatuh   what book of rules says the theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of new york city? or london paris or vienna?  listen junior and learn want to know what the theater is? a flea circus also opera also rodeos carnivals ballets indian tribal dances punch and judy a oneman band  all theater wherever there's magic and makebelieve and an audience  there's theater donald duck ibsen and the lone ranger sarah bernhardt poodles hanneford lunt and fontanne betty grable rex and wild and eleanora duse you don't understand them all you don't like them all why should you? the theater's for everybody  you included but not exclusively  so don't approve or disapprove it may not be your theater but it's theater of somebody somewhere
i just asked a simple question
yes
but hollywood you mustn't stay there
it's only one picture deal
so few come back
i read george jean nathan every week
also addison dewitt
every day
ah
i have a suggestion  there's really not much time left  i mean you haven't had a minute alone yet and  well i could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket if you'd like
i think we'd like very much sure you won't mind?
thanks for your help good luck
you brought it back to the church and then it made it's way back to me again
yes yes it does
 little things here and there it doesn't matter you can be proud of yourself you've got a right to be
are you proud of me bill?
i'll admit i was worried when max called i had my doubts
you shouldn't have had any doubts
 after all the other day was one scene the woods are full of one scene sensations but you did it with work and patience you'll be a fine actress if that's what you want to be
is that what you want me to be?
i'm talking about you and what you want
so am i
what have i got to do with it?
are you all right honey?
everything
don't run away bill
from what would i be running?
you're always after truth  on the stage what about off?
i'm for it
then face it i have since that first night  here  in the dressing room
when i told you what every young actress should know
when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you
your makeup's a little heavy
 and for you
so what are you doing here?
you're quite a girl
you think?
i'm in love with margo hadn't you heard?
you hear all kinds of things
i'm only human rumors to the contrary and i'm as curious as the next man
find out
lemme fix you a drink
margo does not play a lunatic birdie
the bed looks like a dead animal act which one is sables?
but she just got here
he wants to know who brought in the chalice
she's on her way with half the men in the joint  it's only a fur coat
what did you expect  live sables?
bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here
it was fort sumter they fired on
you need new girdles
buy some
the same size?
of course
how do you do my dear
and this is my good friend and companion miss birdie coonan
alright
that stuff'll kill you quick man
oh brother
i'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom birdie dear
there are some human experiences birdie that do not take place in a vaudeville house  and that even a fifthrate vaudevillian should understand and respect  i want to apologize for birdie's
she too is a great admirer of yours
kill the people  got your key?
you bought the new girdles a size smaller i can feel it
something maybe grew a size bigger
when we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours
adorable we now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop
if i may so bold as to say something  did you ever hear the word "union"?
what the fuck are you? a drug counselor or a drug dealer? and you don't even do your own product what kind of businessman are you?
behind in your dues? how much?
i haven't got a union i'm slave labor
well?
but the wardrobe women have got one and next to a tenor a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business
ohoh
birdie
hmm?
you don't like eve do you?
do you want an argument or an answer?
an answer
the rich kind  jeez man the way you smoke that shit is suicide
no
why not?
now you want an argument
she works hard
night an' day
she's loyal and efficient
like an agent with one client
she thinks only for me   doesn't she?
well let's say she thinks only about you anyway
i'll tell you how like  let's see  like she was studyin' you like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints how you walk talk think eat sleep
how are you doing man?
you all put together?
my back's open  did the extra help get here?
there's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers who'd you call  the william morris agency?
you're not being funny i could get actors for less what about the food?
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres  voila
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot didn't he?
there was nothing he didn't know  there's a message from the bartender does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
the only thing i ordered by mistake is the guests  they're domestic too and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns where's bill? he's late
late for what?
don't be dense the party
there now you've got your profit and more you'll have more product day after tomorrow right?
i ain't dense and he's been here twenty minutes
who are you?
miss harrington
what are you doing here?
please don't have me arrested please i didn't steal anything  you can search me
how did you get in here?
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed she must've forgot something and when she went to get it she left the door open i sneaked in and hid till she finished then i just looked around  and pretty soon i was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so i turned them off  and then i guess i fell asleep
you were just looking around
that's all
what for?
uh  right sure the mets are gonna win tomorrow
you probably won't believe me
probably not
it was for my report
what report? to whom?
about how you live what kind of clothes you wear  what kind of perfume and books  things like that you know the eve harrington clubs  that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
i've heard of them
ours was one of the first erasmus hall i'm the president
erasmus hall that's in brooklyn isn't it?
you're going to hollywood  aren't you?  from the trunks you're packing you must be going to stay a long time
i might
i forgive you
the maid'll fix it in the morning
i'll just pick up the broken glass
how'd you get all the way up here from brooklyn?
subway
how long does it take?
it's after one now you won't get home till all hours
that's the door
so there you are it seemed odd suddenly your not being there
why should you think i wouldn't be?
why should you be? after all six nights a week  for weeks  of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater
me?
i hope you don't mind my speaking to you
not at all
i've seen you so often  it took every bit of courage i could raise
to speak to just a playwright's wife? i'm the lowest form of celebrity
you're margo channing's best friend you and your husband are always with her  and mr sampson what's he like?
bill sampson? he's  he's a director
he's the best
he'll agree with you tell me what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out? just huddle in that doorway and wait?
oh no i see the play
you see the play? you've seen the play every performance?  but don't you find it  i mean apart from everything else  don't you find it expensive?
i forgive you
i'm going to take you to margo
oh no
she's got to meet you
there isn't another like you there couldn't be
but if i'd known maybe some other time i mean looking like this
you look just fine   by the way what's your name?
i thought you'd forgotten about me
hello miss channing
if i only knew how
try
you can't forgive me after what i've done  i've fucked up bigtime i've been bad real bad
eve why don't you start at the beginning?
you're not going are you?
good night eve i hope i see you again soon
i'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee
not just that way as a friend
now who's show up at this hour? it's time people went home  hold that coat up   whose is it?
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late
discouraging isn't it? women with furs like that where it never gets cold
hollywood
there should be a new word for happiness being here with miss channing has been  i just can't say she's been so wonderful done so much for me
alright?
i forgive you
mrs richards
karen
karen   isn't it awful i'm about to ask you for another favor  after all you've already done
nobody's done so much eve you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases what is it?
 you want to be margo's new understudy
i don't let myself think about it even   but i do know the part so well and every bit of the staging there'd be no need to break in a new girl   but suppose i had to go on one night? to an audience that came to see margo channing no i couldn't possibly
don't worry too much about that margo just doesn't miss performances if she can walk crawl or roll  she plays
the show must go on
no dear margo must go on  as a matter of fact i see no reason why you shouldn't be margo's understudy
do you think miss channing would approve?
i forgive you
i think she would cheer
but mr richards and mr sampson
then  would you talk to mr fabian about it?
of course
you won't forget it?
i won't forget
you mustn't mind margo too much even if i do
but there must be some reason something i've done without knowing
the reason is margo and don't try to figure it out einstein couldn't
if i thought i'd offended her of all people
why? why can't you hate me? hate me please help me  hate me help me hate me
eve i'm fond of margo too but i know margo and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants
karen   you won't forget will you? what we talked about before?
may i have your coat?
don't bother i can take it up myself
eve i've heard the most wonderful things about your performance
we're having lunch with a movie talent scout
they certainly don't waste much time
i was wondering whether you'd come at all
don't get up  and don't act as if i were the queen mother
i don't expect you to be pleasant
i forgive you
i don't intend to be
i've got a lot to say and none of it is easy
there can't be very much
oh but there is
 and easy or not i won't believe a word
you know i've always considered myself a very clever girl smart good head on my shoulders that sort of thing never the wrong word at the wrong time but then i'd never met addison dewitt  i remember once i had a tooth pulled they gave me some anaesthetic  i don't remember the name  and it affected me in a strange way i heard myself saying things i wasn't even thinking as if my mind were someplace outside of my body and couldn't control what i did or said
 and you felt just like that talking to addison
in a way you find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change  and they become his words  and suddenly you're not saying what you mean but what he means
do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things  that they were all addison?
no i don't expect you to believe anything except that the responsibility is mine and the disgrace
i forgive you
let's not get overdramatic
eve don't cry
i'm not crying
tell me how did your lunch turn out  with the man from hollywood?
some vague promises of a test that's all  if a particular part should come along one of those things
but the raves about your performance
 an understudy's performance
well i think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is really if nothing else  and don't underestimate him  you have a powerful friend in addison
he's not my friend you were my friends
he can help you
oh god my god it's goddamn good to be good forgive me father for i have sinned it's still goddamn good to be good
eve i  i don't think you meant to cause unhappiness but you did more to yourself perhaps  as it turned out  than to anyone else
i'll never get over it
yes you will you theater people always do nothing is forever in the theater love or hate success or failure  whatever it is it's here it flares up and burns hot  and then it's gone
i wish i could believe that
i think i know
something most important you can do
you want to play "cora" you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it
if you told him so he'd give me the part he said he would
after all you've said don't you know the part was written for margo?
it could have been  fifteen years ago it's my part now
large?
you talk just as addison said you did
"cora" is my part you've got to tell lloyd it's for me
addison wants me to play it
over my dead body
a part in a play you'd do all that  just for a part in a play
she knows enough not to be here
congratulations eve
hello miss harrington
no thank you  yes i've seen every performance
every performance? then  am i safe in assuming you like it?
all right cop i want my money
how'd hear about it?
there was an item in the times i like the title 'footsteps on the ceiling'
well it started with the play before this one
i guess it started back home wisconsin that is there was just mum and dad  and me i was the only child and i made believe a lot when i was a kid  i acted out all sorts of things what they were isn't important but somehow acting and makebelieve began to fill up my life more and more it got so that i couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me i'm talking a lot of gibberish aren't i?
not at all
it's been a real pleasure eve
back to copacabana but eve margo let me tell you about eve
please don't misunderstand me mr richards i think that part of miss channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays your new play is for miss channing isn't it mr richards?
well if i didn't come to see the play i wouldn't have anywhere else to go
there are other plays
it's still my money if you want to have a chance at any part of it shithead you will take my $120000 and bet on tomorrow's game
did you see it here in new york?
no don't go
stick around please tell you what  we'll put stanislavsky on his plane you and i then go somewhere and talk
well  if i'm not in the way
what  again?
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time
i must say you can certainly tell mr sampson's been gone a month
you certainly can especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning
i mean the performance except for you you'd think he'd never even directed it  it's disgraceful the way they change everything around
well teacher's away and actors will be actors
what about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
during your second act scene with your father roger ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch he's been coming closer down every night
you haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating
well you've done so much what's new?
the curtains i made them myself
while you're cleaning up i'll take this to the wardrobe mistress
don't bother mrs brown'll be along for it in a minute
well  what do you think of my elegant new suit?
very becoming it looks better on you than it did on me
i can imagine you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there  are you sure you won't want it yourself?
quite sure i find it just a bit too  too "seventeenish" for me
alright
fuck yesterday's game the world series is seven games not six put in my bet
oh come now as though you were an old lady i'm on my way is there anything more you've thought of?
there's the script to go back to the guild
i've got it
 and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man
right here
it seems i can't think of a thing you haven't thought of
that's my job  see you at tea time
eve   by any chance did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time?
oh golly and i forgot to tell you
yes dear you forgot all about it
let me think about it
well i was sure you'd want to of course being his birthday and you've been so busy these past few days and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards  and i guess i was asleep when you got home
yes i guess you were it  it was very thoughtful of you eve
don't get up and please stop acting as if i were the queen mother
if you'd like
i'd like to hear it
some snowy night in front of the fire in the meantime while we're on the subject will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? the caterer forgot them the varnish wasn't dry or something
the hors d'oeuvres are here is there anything else i can do?
good evening mr dewitt
terribly sorry i'm late lunch was long and i couldn't find a cab  where's miss caswell shall we start? oh hello eve
hello miss channing
oh really?
miss channing i can't tell you how glad i am that you arrived so late
really eve? why?
well if you'd been here to begin with i wouldn't have dared to read at all
why not?
 and if you'd come in the middle i'd have stopped i couldn't have gone on
hi  hello darling
it's the tight girdle that does it
relax kid it's only me and my big mouth
it's just that you get me so mad sometimes of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about
ain't it the truth?
yeah really i'm no fucking asshole man i'm a fucking cop
yes it is you're talented famous wealthy  people waiting around night after night just to see you even in the wind and rain
autograph fiends they're not people  those little beast who run in packs like coyotes
they're your fans your audience
well there's one indoors now i've brought her back to see you
you've what?
she's just outside the door
dear birdie won't you sit down miss worthington?
harrington
would you like a drink? it's right beside you
margo really
here's the deal: you meet me tonight across from the garden 33rd & 8th at the beginning of the ninth inning we'll listen to the end of the game together you bring your cash i'll bring mine
margo nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in
that little place just two hours form new york it's on my list of thingsi'llneverunderstand like collecting shrunken indian heads
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
how much time have we?
roughly ten minutes
how far to the station?
three or four miles
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
none in sight there aren't many along this back road
he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical
i got them all going for oakland with bullshit money we'll cover the $800
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
do you want it on?
it doesn't matter
karen  i haven't been pleasant this weekend
we've all seemed a little tense lately
come to think of it i haven't been very pleasant for weeks for that i'm truly sorry more than any two people i know i don't want you and lloyd to be angry with me
we're never deeply angry we just get sore the way you do we know you too well
so many people  know me i wish i did i wish someone would tell be about me
you're margo just  margo
all right what are you gonna do?
what about bill?
what about bill?
he's in love with you
more than anything in this world i love bill and i want bill i want him to want me but me not margo channing and if i can't tell they apart  how can he?
why should he  and why should you?
bill's in love with margo channing he's fought with her worked with her loved her but ten years from now  margo channing will have ceased to exist and what's left will be what?
margo bill is all of eight years younger than you
those years stretch as the years go on i've seen it happen too often
not to you not to bill
i don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
i want 15 on the mets
about eve i've acted pretty disgracefully toward her too
well
margo  margo i want you to know how sorry i am about this
about what?
this i can't tell you how sorry i am
" my hat which has lo these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears is lifted to miss harrington i am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops"  i thought that one went out with woollcott  down here here listen to this " miss harrington had much to tell  and these columns shall report her faithfully  about the lamentable practice in our theater of permitting shall we say  mature  actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory"
i just can't believe it
it get better " about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage shall we say  younger  actresses; about miss harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity"
in this rat race everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent one of the differences between the theater and civilization   what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance
lloyd says it's a publicity release
hey man don't give me that bullshit don't pussyout on me the mets are a fucking lock i wanna make some money
karen in all the years of our friendship i have never let you go to the ladies' room alone but now i must i am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there
with tears?
with tears
but not right away? first the business of fighting them off chin up stout fella
check
i remember
how was the concert?
 'at's my loyal little woman
the critics thought so the audiences certainly think so  packed houses tickets for months in advance  i can't see that either of lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any
you can't put her out i promised margo you've got to see her she worships you it's like something out of a book
are you sure?
that book is out of print karen those days are gone fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets  they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches
now let's not get into a big hassle
coming?
lloyd what happened?
up to here that's where i've got it  up to here of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical
margo again
and again and again two hours late for the audition to begin with
that's on time for margo
then a childish heavyhanded routine about not knowing eve was her understudy
it's just possible she didn't
alright
ok asshole you owe thirty grand now what are you gonna do?
of course she knew for one thing addison told her how superbly eve had read the part  karen let me tell you about eve she's got everything  a born actress sensitive understanding young exciting vibrant
 don't run out of adjectives dear
 everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing
margo hasn't done badly by it
it's going to be a cozy weekend
what is?
we're driving out to the country tomorrow night just the four of us bill margo you and i
what time is it?
when you asked a minute ago it was fivefortytwo it is now five fortythree when you ask a minute from no it will be
i just don't want margo to miss her train as it is she'll barely make the theater
i wanna go double or nothing on the next game
lloyd be careful
but it can't be we can't be out of gas i filled it myself yesterday  wasn't it full when you drove to brewster this morning?
i guess i didn't look you know i don't pay attention to those things
you'll break your neck on that ice
what a way to die  trying to get an actress to the theater in time tell max i want to be buried with royalties
 it's addison from start to finish it drips with his brand of venom taking advantage of a kid like that twisting her words making her say what he wanted her to say
where'd you get all that information?
eve
eve?
she's been to see me as a matter of fact she left just before you came in  you just missed her
double or nothing? are you fucking out of your mind?
that was a pity
she wanted to explain about her interview wanted to apologize to someone  and didn't dare face margo
you know i've been going over our financial condition  if you'll pardon the expression
that's quite a change of subject
what with taxes coming up  and since i'm a playwright and not an oil well operator  well i've been thinking
i'm trying hard to follow you
if  instead of waiting until next season to do 'footsteps on the ceiling' which is in pretty good shape  and if margo can be talked into going on tour with 'aged in wood'  we could put 'footsteps' into production right away
i'm beginning to catch up
if we could cast it properly that is
maybe get some younger actress for the part? someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
i'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
you've got to admit it would be a novelty
eve did mention the play you know but just in passing  she's never ask to play a part like "cora" she'd never have the nerve
eve would ask abbott to give her costello
no i got the idea myself  while she was talking to me
with gestures of course
lloyd richards you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "cora"
now just a minute
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise
now just a minute
all this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named dewitt she apologized didn't she?
take your money? this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it
on her knees i have no doubt very touching very academyofdramatic arts
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left radcliffe
margo  and bill  want us to meet them at the cub room tonight after theater for a bottle of wine
margo in the cub room i couldn't be more surprised if she'd said grant's tomb
i'm glad bill's back
darling i didn't promise eve anything just said i thought she'd be fine for the part but there were some practical difficulties
such as?
well of all
three days that's for the bourgeois  i see a midnight elopement waking up a village person
after all maybe she just wants to apologize
fuck strawberry you're gonna end up owing 60 g to a homicidal maniac
 well? what happened?
you mean  all this time  she'd done nothing but apologize? what'd you say?
what's so funny?
who is it? what's it all about?
i didn't think you would it seems to me karen that for some tine now you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general
i'm a human being i've got some
have you forgotten about eve? what she is what she's done?
old wives' tales born of envy and jealousy and a phobia against truth
honey chili had a point you know i can remember plays about women  even from the south  where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers
that was way back
do you have the money?
would you really? how sweet
how about calling it a night?
i like that girl that quality of quiet graciousness
the general atmosphere is very macbethish what has or is about to happen?
there you are both of you max karen has decided it's time to go
where is she?
who's left out there?
too many and you've got a new guest a movie star from hollywood
you disapprove of me when i'm like this don't you?
not exactly sometimes though i wish i understood you better
what money?
when you do let me in on it
how's the new one coming?
the play? all right i guess
"cora" she's  still a girl of twenty?
twentyish it isn't important
don't you think it's about time it became important?
how do you mean?
don't be evasive
margo you haven't got any age
miss channing is ageless spoken like a press agent
i don't got it not tonight you can't get blood from a stone
i know what i'm talking about after all they're my plays
spoken like an author  lloyd i'm not twentyish i am not thirtyish three months ago i was forty years old forty four oh  that slipped out i hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it now i feel as if i'd suddenly taken all my clothes off
week after week to thousands of people you're as young as you want
 as young as they want you mean and i'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i'm six or six hundred
she's your understudy
eve? eve my understudy? but i had no idea
i thought you knew she was put on over a week ago
i'm sure you underestimate yourself eve you always do  you were about to tell me about eve
you'd have been proud of her
i'm sure
this psycho can
she was a revelation
to you too?
what do you mean?
i mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twentyfouryearold character played by twentyfouryearold actress
that's beside the point
you've been talking to that venomous fishwife addison dewitt
 in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac
you knew when you came in that the audition was over that eve was your understudy playing that childish game of cat and mouse
not mouse never mouse if anything  rat
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most
hey honey
oooo big fucking scary guy just put $120000 on tomorrow's game
perfectly innocent man have been hanged for less i'm lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately  as if it were holy gospel
i never said it was
i shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater
karen and i just don't want an accident
i have no intention of having an accident
how fortunate that i have an understudy so ready so willing and so able to go on
the audience will want its money refunded believe me
it's been quite a night i understand that your understudy  miss harrington  has given her notice
yes sir
you're a fucking joke you know that?  he's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended and i've been waiting here since  forget it listen up you're gonna get us both fucking killed you know that
very discreet a note right out in the open like that next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings  or tap a glass
 and bill especially bill eve did that too
you know she probably means well after all
that depends
i mean really deeply angry
i don't think i could be
now wait a minute you're always so touchy about his plays it isn't the part  it's a great part and a fine play but not for me anymore  not a foursquare upright downright forthright married lady
what's your being married got to do with it?
hello
we are ready with your call to beverly hills
you do know that he's gonna blow up your house kill your wife and kids 
call what call?
it this templeton 89970? miss margo channing?
that's right but i don't understand
we are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight california time to mr william sampson in beverly hills
i placed?
"liebestraum"
i just played it
play it again
but that was the fourth straight time
then this will be five i suppose you think i'm too drunk to count
good i'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble i hate that motherfucking house and 
no you're just crazy about "liebestraum"
"liebestraum"
look miss channing it's kind of depressing if you don't mind my saying so everybody's kind of dying on the vine
make it bergdorf goodman and now everything is on its proper shelf eh max? done up in little ribbons i could die right now and nobody'd be confused how about you max?
supposed you dropped dead what about your inventory?
margo you by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
let the rest of the world beat their brains out for a buck it's friends that count and i got friends
here you are maxie dear one good burp and you'll be rid of that miss caswell
the situation i'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out i made a promise
miss caswell?  what?
he's gonna kill you man do you hear me motherfucker? you dead get it?
well if she can act she might not be bad she looks like she might burn down a plantation
i feel right now like there's one burning in me
when's the audition?
a couple of weeks
i tell you what why don't i read with her?
would you?
anything to help you out max
this is real cooperation i appreciate it
not at all and you could do me a big favor if you would
all you got to do is name it
how's the case going?
you get quick action don't you?
margo i wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you
you said yourself my inventory was in good shape  all of my merchandise put away to keep her here with nothing to do  i'd be standing in her way and you need her max
but what could she do?
she'd be a great help  read scripts interview people you have to see get rid of the ones you don't have to you'd be a man of leisure
well
think of your health max  more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track
i don't know if this would be a wise move
promise
i promise
what case?
this is for lawyers to talk about this concerns a runoftheplay contract and this you can't rewrite or ad lib
are you threatening me with legal action mr fabian?
are you breaking the contract?
answer my question
who am i to threaten? i'm a dying man
i didn't hear you
i said i'm a dying man
what the hell were you doing rewriting my story
i sure couldn't hurt it could i?
it was fine the way it was
the fucking rapists man the punks who raped that nun the $50000 reward from the church remember?
it was bullshit the way it was
i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia?
what have you been here nine months?i been in this business since i was sixteen
and you've had some fucking meteoric rise that's for sureby the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau
you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale
bradlee went to harvard
they're all the same all those ivy league placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart
i'm smart enough to know my story was solid
mine's better
no way
yeah sure yeah we're on it bigtime lots of leads you bet
what is it about my writing that's so rotten?
carl?
yeah?
you heard?  they put us both on the breakin thing simons liked the way we worked together  listen i'm sorry i said your story was bullshit
it's ok; i'm sorry i called you a failure
forget it the main thing  did you call me a failure?
all right what do we know?
let me lay a little theory on you
i'm not interested in theory what do we know? for example hunt's disappeared
well barker tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the airconditioning system
get this man i was at the game today face to fucking face with strawberry jesus i saw him strikeout and you know what? he looked at me and i looked at him and he laughed and i laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket that he struck out on purpose and that he's saving it up for the big one tomorrow today i understood for the very first time that 
and mccord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the democratic convention  the times has got to be full of it it can't be crazy cubans
what though?  it can't be the republicanshe'd never allow something as stupid as this not when he's gonna slaughter mcgovern anyway
hey?
hmm
what do you think he meant this particular incident? were there others? how would we find out? you know anyone important?
what do you think?
hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant
maybe a political operative of some sort
a spy you mean?
you think they are confidential? i don't know anything about how this town works i haven't lived here a year yet
but
what is your problem?  why'd you snap at me?  i just wanted a statement
 that there was never any other way it could have gone  never any other way so you had better just put in my fucking bet $120000 on the last game the big one come on are you a bookmaker or fucking what?
july of '71
that was fun  what now?
i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion
what's that?
goddamnit
see?
i'm trying
fifteen phone calls
fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep
why didn't we get that?
forgive me father for i have sinned it has been two days since my last confession father my sin is a terrible sin a sin of omission there was another sin that happened at the same time and in the same place but my sin i think was graver stil
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company
see her?  get anything?
for the paper no; for us plenty  i waited a long time and finally this big guyi guess a bodyguard he left and i knocked and she remembered me we talked awhile
and?and?
she was panicked carlevery time i mentioned watergate you could tell
were you eyebrow reading?
who's first?
i don't get it this really was my turf
you're not a kid anymore
this is terrific work if you like rejection
father if it was so trivial so natural so  no i have sinned and you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition and to absolve me father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve god?
i never scared anyone before
it's not us they were scared before we got there  what do we know?
facts or theory?
anything you've got
we know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked
and that something's got to be more than just hunt liddy and the five burglarsthose indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down what else do we know?
we never reveal our sources which is why you can talk to us
we understand your problem
you believe in the president you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal
i hate both parties
it's funny you knew but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt
republican?
sure
who'd you vote for?
when?
'68
did he just say what i think he said?
i  couldn't believe what she told me eight cups of coffee worth
go on go on
we've got to find out who the five guys arethe five with access to the slush fundthey were aware of the breakin
then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit
i also thought of that bread father and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died and i kept the cool damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god?
it goes very highwe've got to find out where
we will
she was really paranoid the bookkeeper
how do you want to handle sloan?
you mean who's going to play the mean mp and who's going to be the nice one?  whichever
he's another ivy leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you're not
you want me to be the bastard
think sloan's back?  what's wrong?
there had to be a white house overseer
lookfive men controlled that slush fund as creepthree of them we've got mitchell stans magruder and we're pretty sure of kalmbach
i think of running for help and falling to my knees in prayer
the la times has a huge interview with baldwin
the lookout in the motor inn?  he say anything we don't know?
goddamnit
shit
we gotta top the times
i know i know
if we could name the guys got the reports we'd be ahead again
shit who do we know?
i know a lawyer at justice
has he got an ax?
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning  and my sin you see father 
almost every source we've used has been republican this guy's a card carrying democrat
i want you to shut up and listen to me
i haven't said anything
for the first time i'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter woodward i got a tip a guy called me up with a tip  someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats dirty tricks shit like that the fbi knows about segretti howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to himthey interrogated him but on account of segretti wasn't involved with the breakin they didn't follow through but segretti did a lot of travelinghe called these lawyers from different places and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing
how high up which republicans?
that's what we've got to find out but segretti went to southern cal and so did a bunch of nixon men
haldeman i know who else?
dwight chapin nixon's appointments chiefhe knew segretti in school maybe i'm crazy but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense what were the three theories?
the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasn't any reason they were so far ahead but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in
yes sister?
so maybe watergate wasn't really about watergatemaybe that was just a piece
because a year before the republicans weren't ahead not in the polls muskie was running ahead of nixon then before he self destructed
segretti crisscrossed the country over ten times in six monthsand never stayed anyplace over a night or two  switch to another station huh? you're driving me crazy with that
california illinois florida new hampshireall the major democratic primary states  why does everything you play sound the same?
what would you have done?
you think we're being set up?christ deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names
it makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the white house? each new member of the president's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon
you think this was clawsen's initiation?
he'll give us a sworn statement
that cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the democratsfive guys had control
those boys those sad raging boys they came to me as the needy do and like many of the needy they were rude like all the needy they took and like all the needy they needed  father i knew them; they learn in our school and play in our schoolyard and they are good boys
mitchell stans magruder kalmbach
i think that's him
who?
nah  maybe
what if i went up and introduced myselfthink he'd slug me?
well we are trying to ruin his life
it's nothing personal though 
what's the matter?
same as magruder i don't like it when they turn out to be human
i wish we were investigating attila the hun
yo big black we needs a name for this joint
jesus
sloan told the grand juryhe answered everything they asked him that means there's a record somewhere
how many fucking sources they think we got?
deep throat won't confirmi never thought he was scared of anyone but he's scared of haldeman
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury 
woodward?
hmm?
what was the mistake? do you think it's been rigged all along the way leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? they couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone you know what that means?
you overslept?
i finally got through to sloanit was all a misunderstanding that we had: he would have told the grand jury about haldeman he was ready to only nobody on the grand jury asked him the goddamn question
i can'ti can't answer you just because you want me to answer you
blak out  blak listed  blak ball need i say more
what does it say?
john n mitchell while serving as us attorney general personally controlled a secret cash fund that
jeeeeeeesus
fund that was used to gather information against the democrats
jeeeeeeesus
according to sources involved in the watergate investigation beginning in the spring of 1971
jeeeeeeesus
almost a year before he left the justice department
jeeeeeeeeesus
to become president nixon's campaign manager on march 1 mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund
keep trying
all that crap you're putting it in the paper? it's all been denied you tell your publishertell katie graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published good christ that's the most sickening thing i ever heard
sir i'd like to ask you a few
what time is it?
11:30
morning or night?
night
look you've been jerking my chain all day if there's some reason you can't talk to melike the fact that you've already leaked everything to the new york timesjust say so
listen i've got a dinnercan't we do this tomorrow?
you want barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
i'll never get out of here in time
benedict arnold
the telephone calls we know about that
the rest is barker's bank records it's mostly the eightynine thousand in mexican cashier's checks
i never could figure just who this dahlberg was  think it might be anything?
sorry  now if it was hunt you were interested in
howard hunt?
sure him i liked he was a very nice person secretive too traveled all over but a decent man
any idea what he did?
oh the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating kennedy
teddy kennedy?
hi it's me i'm still here
same thing y'knowwhati'msayin' y'knowwhati'msayin'
i'm so glad
i'd really like to see mr dardis
and you will  but not now
i called him from washington he's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning
could you reach mr dardis by car radio?
mr dardis does call in every so often?
well of course
donald segretti?
i'm carl bernstein  my paper sent me out to see if i couldn't persuade you to go on the record
you can't
we know  we know  yo check it my black brothers we can't let this slide  not this injustice nah no way  dem' two real coons iz ill
according to what we've been able to verify you've been busy
i've got a lot of energy
listenwe know you're involved in thiswe're going to get the story why not help?
they never told me anything except my own rolei had to find out the rest in the papers
by "they" you mean the white house don't you?  your buddy from usc dwight chapin he works for the white house
i know where dwight works
do you feel much about the things you did?
i didn't do anything wrong
tell that to muskie
oh maybe nickel and dime stuff
he gots to be did
during the florida primary you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls
sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe  off the record
you wrote the canuck letterthe one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians
i didn't
but you know who did
none of it was my idea carli didn't go looking for the job
chapin did contact you then?
sureoff the record
on the orders of haldeman?
i don't know anything about haldeman except dwight's frightened of him everybody's frightened of himchrist i wish i'd never gotten messed around with thisall i wanna do is sit in the sun; sit swim see some girls
you truly are a dancing fool
it gets interesting if it was haldeman because our word is that when chapin says something he's gotten the ok from haldeman and when haldeman says something he's gotten the ok from the president
can't help you
harry i just talked to a miami investigator about barker
so?
i'm the one sent you to toronto bernstein
that was awhile ago
down to miami and backhow much damage can i do?
you got more than one source?
speak
he was going to go into law practice with segretti
everybody say ho
no
and we got a guy in justice
what's a real denial?
i thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story  you think i like being aced out?
it would have been nice to have had this i sure would have liked to have had this
there's nothing new in it
if he did it or just said he did it god knows
bernstein are you sure on this story?
absolutely
hannah i never would have bothered you but i'm off to miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast
ho
where are your bills carl?
oh they're here  i'm keeping much better records now hannah  see? 
hey very tense
lot of pressure at the star  carl when we got married you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split you were solvent that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life and now look at this  how much did the damn bike cost?
five hundred; six maybe
you're two months behindyou got enough to cover?
i think
give me your checkbook then
i thought you had to get to miami
there's always a later plane
my name is honeycutt and i want to try something different  can you do this for me?
you're a sex junkie you know that carl?
this is practically a high school reunion for us janei would have sprung for a classier place
anyplace really public they'd know about itthey know everything at the committee carl
you don't really think you're being followed?
this girlfriend of mine at the committee the other day she went back to the da to tell the things the fbi didn't ask her that night her boss he knew what she'd done they control everything; that's how they know it all
fbi too?
you don't believe me? well i was working the weekend of the breakin and my god all the executives were running around like crazyyou had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machineand when the fbi came to investigate they never even asked me about it
if you don't like it down there why don't you quit?
i don't know what they'd do to me
hey easy
you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues  you could give me something
yeah
you've really got to go
but i want you to know that i understand why you're afraida lot of good people down there at the committee are afraid i'm really sorry for what you're being put through
all those articles you people write where do you find that stuff?
we don't tell anyone that which is why you can talk to us and if we can't verify what you say someplace else we don't print it that's another reason you can relax
you were hugh sloan's bookkeeper when he worked for maurice stans at finance and we were sort of wondering did you go work for stans immediately after sloan quit or was there a time lapse?
one minute but then
i was just curiousyou don't do it well so i wondered have you been threatened if you told the truth is that it?
no never in so many words
there are too many people watching methey know i know a lot
it was all in hundreds wasn't it?
c'mon  it's easy  it's the same thing y'all do out at the yankee game no different 'cept we changing one word  everybody go it?
a lot of it was i just thought it was sort of an allpurpose political fundyou know for taking fat cats to dinner things like that
could buy a lot of steaks 350000 dollars
i can't be positive that it was used for the breakin but people sure are worried
which people?
the ones who could disburse the money
who were they?
there were a group of themi think five i don't know their names
it's awfully hot  and you haven't finished telling me about the money
omigod there was so much of it six million came in one twoday period six million cash we couldn't find enough places to put it i thought it was all legal i guess i did til after the breakin when i remembered gordon got so much of it
gordon liddy you mean?
yeah
it was all so crazythe day after the breakin he gave us a speech bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of hisgordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everythingdon't let one bad apple spoil the barrel he said you just know that when gordon liddy's calling someone a bad apple something's wrong somewhere  it's all so rotten and getting worse and all i care about is hugh sloan his wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right and he quit he quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it
why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office irwin?
'cause i'm not calling out from the phone company anymore  i think the place is bugged
so tell me about the times article
what do you want to know?
no games irwin; give
my big civil rights buddy  boy if john mitchell was after your phone records would you be screaming  what're you onto?
something maybe big
and that makes anything you do ok is that it?
just tell me about the goddamn article
alright  here we go  let's go niggers  let's go niggers
it was accurate but i can't get a fuller listing for youall barker's phone records have been subpoenaed
who by?
a miami da the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis 
then again maybe things are even worse than we've written
try and understand this i'm a decent republican i believe in richard nixon i worked in the white house four yearsso did my wife what happened on june 17 i don't think the president knew anything about some of his men i'm not so sure of
do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
that's another of the things i'm not so sure of
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
we were never told flat out "don't talk" but the message was clear
to cover up?
let's go niggers
but they both worked at the white house?
i will not talk about the other two
right
ordinarily though what was the procedure?
what happens when the baby comes?
i really can't talk now
this'll only take one second
i'm not your source on that
that leaves haldeman period
if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund?
you idiot  you almost gave me a massive coronary
then it's our asses isn't it?
same kind of crap
i don't know i don't know it feels thin
well shit we oughtta be tense we're about to accuse mr haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in america of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the white house  it would be nice if we were right
what's this?
i don't think either metropolitan or national should cover the story  i don't think we should cover the story period
go on
it will it just hasn't bottomed out yet give it time
lookwhy would the republicans do it? my god mcgovern is self destructing before our eyesjust like muskie did humphrey the bunch of 'em  why would the burglars have put the tape around the door instead of up and down unless they wanted to get caught? why did they take a walkie talkie and then turn it off unless they wanted to get caught? why would they use mccordthe only direct contact to the republicans?
you saying the democrats bugged themselves?
i didn't mean to scare you like that
i was told by this guy at the white house that hunt was investigating teddy kennedy
how senior?
just tell me his title
i don't know titles
this is a daily paper we'll explain it tomorrow  you're certain on mitchell?
i saw him he verifies
i got clawsen on hold
his dialing finger must be falling off
what do you think?
i'm sure
well you did
we can't talk inside either?
anything else from mr throat?
mr caddy? my name's bob woodward i'm from the post and i wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case
i'm not here
douglas caddy the attorney of record when questioned about his presence in the courtroom denied he was in the courtroom "i'm not here" mr caddy said
mr rafferty was very helpful four cubanamericans and this other man james mccord
look i told you inside
what i don't understand is how you got here
i assure you there's nothing mysterious involved
probably you're right but a little while ago i was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars
give me some?
so?
did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break in called you?
there is no reason to assume other people were involved
they are not my clients
you're a lawyer and you're here
i met one of the defendants mr barker at a social occasion once  i have nothing more to say
a miami social occasion?  mr rafferty told me the cubans were from miami
barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then
it was really nice of you to come since you'd only met him once
are you implying you don't believe me?
i'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street  you must be crazy julius
i have nothing more to say
you claiming it was all a misunderstanding ken?
absolutelymarilyn's gotten it totally wrong
she's an awfully good reporteri can't remember her getting too much wrong before can you?
that's a bullshit question that's a question straight out of wichita kansas
sorry ken; listen one last thing: where did your talk with berger happen?
where?  what do you mean where?
well was it in a bar her apartment some restaurant
this should take only a minute mr dahlberg but we're doing a follow up on the breakin  and i was kind of curious about your check
check?
oh i'm sorry  did i embarrass you sweetheart?  oh
whoa hold up li'l sis'  i done told you 'bout that  julius ain't my name you better recognize hopkins was our slave name  my true name is
the twentyfive thousand dollar one  the one with your name on it  in bernard barker's florida account  bernard barker the watergate burglar
you're definitely doing a story?
yes sir
that twentyfive thousand dollars is money i collected for nixon in this year's campaign
i see and how do you think it reached miami?
i don't know; i really don't the last time i saw it was when i was in washington i gave it to the finance department of the committee to re elect the president how it got to that burglar your guess is as good as mine
i saw the flag signalwhat's up?
nothing that's the problemthe story's gone underground
you thought i'd help out on specifics?  i'll confirm what you get try to keep you on the right track but that's all  are you guys really working?  how much?
i don't know maybe sixteen eighteen hours a daywe've got sources at justice the fbi but it's still drying up
i'm not callin you big black africa mommy and daddy named you julius
then there must be something mustn't there look forget the myths the media's created about the white house the truth is these are not very bright guys and things got out of hand
if you don't like them why won't you be more concrete with me?
because the press stinks toohistory on the run that's all you're interested in  you come up with anything?
john mitchell resigned as head of creep to spend more time with his family that doesn't exactly have the ring of truth  howard hunt's been foundthere was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag
follow the money always follow the money
to where?
go on
this man gordon liddyhe's going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglarswe know he knows a lot we just don't know what
you changed cabs? you're sure no one followed you?
i did everything you said but it all seemed
damn sis you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece
melodramatic?  things are past thatremember these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city
what's the whole thing aboutdo you know?
what i know you'll have to find out on your own
liddyyou think there's a chance he'll talk?
my turn to keep you waiting  what's the topic for tonight?
ratfucking
in my day it was simply called the double cross i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck in our context it simply means infiltration of the democrats
i know what it meanssegretti wouldn't go on the record but if he would we know he'd implicate chapin and that would put us inside the white house
yes the little ratfuckers are now running our government
who?be specific how high up?
my group we need some exposure was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
you'll have to find that out won't you
what?
i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery
do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
they know but they focused on the burglaryif it didn't deal with the breakin they didn't pursue it
why didn't they?who told them not to?
someone with authority i'd imagine wouldn't you?  don't you know what you're onto? come on
mitchell knew then
of coursemy god you think something this big just happens? the breakin and the cover up of course mitchell knew but no more than ehrlichman
haldeman too?
hook you up?  the maumau's?  you must be smoking  why in the world would i want to hook up a bunch of red black and green flagwaving pseudo revolutionairies?
why did they do all this for chrissakes?what were they after?
total manipulation i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution but they don't think along philosophical lines
talk about segretti
don't concentrate on segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too
there were more then
follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere
the canuck letterwas that a white house operation
don't you miss the grand scheme too
how grand?
nationwidemy god they were frightened of muskie and look who got destroyedthey wanted to run against mcgovern and look who they're running against they bugged they followed people false press leaks fake letters they canceled democratic campaign rallies they investigated democratic private lives they planted spies stole documents on and on don't tell me you think this was all the work of little don segretti
so now i see where you're coming from  just because we ain't rapping about gucci timberland rolex benz cristal ho's and bitches we're pseudo
and justice and fbi know all this?
yes yes everything there were over fifty people employed by the white house and creep to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief
fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats?
i know i know the pressure's off the white house and it's all back on the post
you've done worse than let haldeman slip away you've got people feeling sorry for himi didn't think that was possible a conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck you build from the outer edges and you go step by step if you shoot too high and miss then everybody feels more secure you've put the investigation back months
we know thatand if we were wrong we're resigningwere we wrong?
hello i'm bob woodward of the washing post and  mullen and company public relations? could you tell me when you expect mr hunt?  he is?
howard hunt here
hi i'm bob woodward of the post and
yes yes what is it?
who are you revolting against?
i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate?
your name please
james mccord
and what is your occupation mr mccord?
security consultant
where?
government recently retired
where in government?
central intelligence agency
where?
we're revolting against the powers that be that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color  and we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the us of a
i'm so glad you could come mr
you know the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and i was thinking back a year or two ago when ben called me and said he wanted to publish the pentagon papers the next day the times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't don't" and i was frightened but i knew if i said no i'd lose the whole fifth floor so we published and that night after i'd told ben to go ahead i woke up in the darkness and i thought "oh my lord what am i doing to this newspaper?"  i woke up again last night with that same question  are we right on this story?
i think so
are you sure?
no
when will you be do you think? when are we going to know it all?
it may never come out
never? please don't tell me never  ben says you've found some wonderful sources
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man and some people from the committee to reelect yes ma'am
and the underground garage one  would i know him?
please
i couldn't say
but it's possible
it is
you've never told anyone who he is?  but you'd have to tell me if i asked you  tell me
i would if you really ever wanted to know
we're going to need lots of good luck aren't we?
you are ignoring the importance of the dahlberg repercussions
nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions
correctionwhen you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the sans souci
this white house guy a good one a pro came up and asked what is this watergate compulsion with you guys and i said well we think it's important and he said if it's so goddamn important who the hell are woodward and bernstein?
if you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours  what's his name again?
ask him what he's really sayinghe means take the story away from woodstein and give it to his people at the national desk
well i've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around wouldn't you say so?
absolutelyand that's all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting
where's that cheery face we've come to know and love?
you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarterstell me harry why should i be smiling?
as usual that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly  except  it wasn't local democratic headquarters it was national democratic headquarters  and  these weren't just any idiots these were special idiots seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying  a walkietalkie forty rolls of film cameras lock picks pensized tear gas guns plus various bugging devices  not to mention over two thousand dollars mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse?
go on go on
that's everything bachinski had i think it's worth following up
ok get on this whouse guy and do a better job then you did on mccord
stop it
delacroix
i did all right on mccord
then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr mccord is security coordinator for the committee to reelect the president otherwise known as creep?
the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats? what the hell does that mean?
mr john mitchell the head of creep says it means nothing  "this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity and we will not forget it or condone it"
you can't believe that
what'd you get on whouse?
lotsa hints
who's charles colson?
i would liken your query to being in russia half a century ago and asking someone "i understand who lenin is and trotsky i got too but who's this yokel stalin?"
who's colson harry?
yeah him
the second most powerful man is robert haldeman just below him are a trio: mr erlichman is haldeman's friend and they protect the president from everybody which is why they are referred to as either the german shepherds or the berlin wall mr mitchell we've already discussed mr colson is the president's special counsel
thanks harry  know anything about colson?
whaddya got whaddya got?
so?
i never asked them about watergate i only said what were hunt's duties at the white house they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty
who you got?
anything?
woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the breakin thingabsolute page one stuff
in other words you got nothing you're thumbsucking
could develop
what makes you think he would write a show about the maumau's
i can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but bernstein"  i want to send a reporter to miami
anyone but bernstein
howard
remember toronto harry
that was awhile ago
i don't get ityou were the one who wanted to fire him
has any of them got an ax?
listen we didn't make them do these thingsonce they did it's our job to report it
listen i love this country you think i want to bring it down?i'm not some goddamn zany i was a hawk
harry weren't you just arguing the opposite way?
you don't have the demographics
more denunciations?
what else have you got?
isn't that what you'd expect them to say?
no
what do you think mrs graham wants to see me for?
maybe to fire yousince you two started on this story the post stock has dropped what 50 percent?  and the word is some nixon people are challenging her tv licenses i'm not saying she's going on relief but i don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you
you think she wants us to ease up on the story?
which young?
and he says chapin hired segretti
well and good but when will he say it on the record
so are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to delacroix or set up a meeting?  i'm talking 'bout me your only brother ya own flesh and blood hook a brother up youknowwhati'msayin'
mr sloan?
i'd like to talk to you i really would but my lawyers say i shouldn't until after the watergate trial
does "they" mean the white house?
as opposed to the committee? the committee's not an independent operation everything is cleared with the white house i don't think that the fbi or the prosecutors understand that
the report on the cash in maurice stans' safe the three hundred fifty thousand that's true?
no it was closer to seven hundred thousand
and as treasurer you could release those funds?
when so ordered
colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that
haldeman  right?
that'swhati'msayin'  i'm not blowin' my young career brother or no brother for you or anybody else
i can't say anything i'm sorry 
one thing i'm not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to liddy how did that work?
go on
a boy or a girl?
and it wasn't ehrlichman or colson or the president
look when the watergate grand jury questioned you did you name names?
hi i'm bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at home
i already get the post i don't need another subscription

well state's got a good business school  and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team  green peppers?
yeah  so wow you've got it figured out
what do i do?
well i mean business is okay and lacrosse is awesome but what am i gonna be a pro lacrosse player?  i really have no idea
oh thank god i thought i was the only one
well you're not  oil and vinegar?
yeah  you know people are always like "what're you gonna major in?" and i don't know  and they're like "you'll figure it out"  yeah?  when?
i know  salt and pepper?
so we're gonna be close next year?
you  oh you mean  yeah east lansing and ann arbor
i've got this lacrosse game  it's really important it's our last game and you know central almost beat us last time so i really want to kick their ass and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at state which means that after the game i might be able to stop by
you can't sing at the competition
i'm sorry i totally spaced  i justi didn't realize it
what do you do?
it's okay you should do whatever makes you happy
what about the game?
i'm not playing
you're missing the game for us?
there's something i've been meaning to tell you heather
what's that?
this isn't the best way to proposition me
no that's not what i mean  i mean  look  you know what made me leave that game?  coach was giving this speech about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score
this isn't any better chris
oz it's okay i know
and another thing you better stay away from my sister or you better
you called me oz
hmm  you know that's  really a shitty middle name
i can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy
vanderbilt's not that far from u of m
yeah right
what?  we both have cars
yeah but no offense you're talking about a posthigh school long distance relationship and you and kevin haven't even done it yet
that's not why we're going out
what the hell are you expecting him to drive to vanderbilt for?  milk and cookies?
jessica  he'll drive there for me and i'll drive to ann arbor for him we're going to have sex when he's ready and i'm ready  it's got to be completely perfect  i want the right place the right time the right moment
life is beginning to look up  it's all good in da neighborhood
vicky it's not a space shuttle launch it's sex  so did you do the physics writeup?
he likes it
of course he does  what about you? have you just never had one with kevin  or have you never had one period?
i think i've had one
well that's a no  no wonder you're not psyched about sex  you've never even had one manually?
i've never tried it
jessica can you drive me home?
ah you'll get her back soon enough that's easy she likes you  what you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons  you gotta give her what she's never had
what?
i'll give you a hint  "ohhh yeah yeah"  comprende?

after that i swore i'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it  and i haven't since except for bogey's party and my stunning gastrointestinal display 
that was good  you were holding the evidence
we might need some mo' money behind this
what does it say?
whoa
after the revolution the paris cemeteries overflowed they dug up all the old bodies and brought them here seven million people mostly very poor
pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers
well they are french
these tunnels must loop around and connect
okay be careful
oh god shit

bullshit your uncle told you

no but i'll kill your fucking girlfriend
don't be an idiot i'm not the only one if i die serafine dies
bullshit you're bluffing
claude?
the adm let's go
so if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves what do you want with drugs? you like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
what's the problem?
hurry up i wanna watch hbo
do you think i'm an idiot?
another step and he's dead
you bastard god i should've known you wanted the cure all for yourself
ha some wonder drug
nothing's happening

oh shit no
that's not all  marcel  officer boulard was following you
he was a good man now his wife is a widow
ahh the luxuries of life
merde wait here when i return you tell me about last night huh?
but i don't remember anything i swear
i always wanted to do that i saw it in a movie
what about me?
i'm sorry my friend i'm not signing books right now there's been a tragedy
it's horrible terrence was one of the most brilliant men i've known
yeah well why did he hang out here? the cops said it's dangerous 
psychic awareness right
you think it's silly but do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
what?
yo check it  this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills you hear me
he's on a new drug called zbh or "daydream" it allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming he is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time
andy
yeah?
you didn't know? but then why did you well don't worry it's relatively mild
not you too 
you're exactly right andy i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm and now i'm counting on your assistance too
"simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed"  these pictures are not just myth andy the scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public this is the medieval version of a newspaper
i don't believe we've been introduced
great later on we'll have to get together for cocktails right now i kinda have to hurry before i grow a lot of hair and eat people  say this heart thing works what's it got to do with adm?
it's chemistry andy nothing more mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine like chain reaction in the infectee there were not many biochemists working in the twelfth century but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to
chill i'm the brains behind this outfit
uncle terrence
yes i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications it took a lot of trial and error but finally he got it: adenine dimethyloxide adm i call it adam but just before he was attacked he hid it
because gaston was after it
eight o'clock shit you'd think my uncle would have left a clue a note something
it killed him you coulda just used draino it's cheaper
all my life i've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind well this is it this is power
uncle terrence?
andy? andy is that you?
andy i have to tell you about the dream i had  or that i'm still having  it feels like a systemic physio tropic reaction to some drug maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative but it is hyperreal i'd swear my legs had been cut off or wait a second i'm getting a strange metaphysical buzz shit i'm uh dead aren't i?
undead right sort of an ectocosmic manifestation what a pisser tell you one thing though timothy leary will be jealous as hell
and i'm the feet
great but listen i need to know where you hid the adm?
the adm be careful andy it's very powerful how do you know about it?
oh shit no andy don't let them take me back there
where is it please
uncle terrence you're
yeah i finally "checked out" thank god but there's a bit of unfinished business
claude
andrew mcdairmo?

not too well he taught at the sorbonne right? dad always calls him his "hippie brother" did some work with timothy leary i think and  is he is he going to die?
no the doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time but basically he is how you say a legume
legume? you mean a vegetable?
vegetable right my mistake it seems he was attacked by a maniac maybe two or three maniacs just after midnight yesterday they fled into the tunnels beneath paris that's all we know
what do you mean maniacs?
well here's what i think happened a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night why? perhaps he's making a few francs on the side the psychedelic drug market is big these days he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and like they say if you lie with dogs you get fleas
maybe we should go now you must be very tired we'll call if any new 
i can't believe this why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn animals that attacked my uncle?
yeah i guess so  did he say anything? before the coma?
we ran out without my shoes and the floor  i gotta get my stuff  what about our savings?
just the name of this hospital st severin he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness
why would he pick this one?
i don't know there were others much closer he was religious?

okay so he's weird maybe on drugs still that's not 
i'm telling you it's not drugs it's something more someth 
don't give me your black magic bullshit seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny american boy? do you have a motive?  do you have a weapon? or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?

just a crazy call from a girl probably fucked up on drugs i wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual
what did she say?
something about a monster underground in the catacombs under place denfert

and a song someone sings once upon a december
people say anastasia was the only member of the royal family to escape alive  that makes her an orphan too 
what happened to your parents?
i don't know  i don't remember anything that happened before the revolution  
you know it's strange  anastasia's grandmother the dowager empress tatiana has been looking for anastasia since the revolution  why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
some tap dancing some singing
i don't know  i don't see what this has to do with me
why do you want to go to paris?
i have my reasons
you never thought of the possibility?
do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
sorry  it's a reflex living in an orphanage if someone bothers you  you automatically come up swinging
by pulling my hair?
i'm going to stretch my legs
come on up
just what do you think you're doing?
how different?
forged papers now what?
now just get off the train
come on
you must enjoy causing me pain
you never said anything to me about having to prove i'm a princess
every russian family has one
fish fork salad fork meat fork and    [this section also not ledgable]
it's the best fork of all
what a beautiful ship
you said you wouldn't laugh
trust me  of course i still have to pitch it to my boss but we'll have an answer one way or the other
it's so beautiful  and sad
sad?
lost it feels lost this was hers?
yeah  well yours you still don't believe that you're the princess do you?
i know i must have had something to do with the palace  i've had little flashes of things  but being the princess? it doesn't matter as long as i find my home
well the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it you're lucky you don't remember the revolution  i never had much but what i did have  i lost
i'm sorry
oh i'm sorry
nervous?
yes  if i can't convince sophie i'll never be able to see tatiana
well who was it that taught me how to do that?  huh?
dela i'm aboard  as long as i get to hoof and get paid too
i'm so scared

no it wasn't a bat i saw this horrible man  i remember him i think
don't you child?
oh yes grandmama  i wait until i hear
dmitri didn't want the money?
why does everyone have to act that way?
you'll have to become used to it child if you accept the crown
"if" i accept? of course i'm going to accept it's what i always wanted
i wanted to come home grandmama  and i did i came back to my home with you
to what?
you can't go back to find your home your home is in your heart in the future that you make for yourself

yeah 'cause ii'm you know i'm i'm obsessed withwith uh with death i think big
yeah?
big subject with me yeah
i've a very pessimistic view of life you should know this about me if we're gonna go out you know iii feel that life isis divided up into the horrible and the miserable
m'hm
those are the two categories
m'hm
you know they're thethe horrible would be like uh i don't know terminal cases you know?
m'hm
don't worry about the damn phone  i won't answer it

and blind people crippled
yeah
i don'tdon't know how they get through life it's amazing to me

oh yeah
no i'm serious  i just got my mustache wet
oh yeah?
you see like you and i
you are extremely sexy
no i'm not
unbelievably sexy yes you are because you know what you are? you'reyou're polymorphously perverse
i've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right  in my previous work it's been all surface superficial  i have never really dug deep  not anymore  as mark twain fully understood satire is the way  race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder  if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony it's about promoting racial healing
well what doeswhat does that mean? i don't know what that is
uh uh you'reyou're exceptional in bed because you got you get pleasure in every part of your body when i touch you
you know what i mean? like the tip o'your nose and if i stroke your teeth or your kneecaps you get excited
come on  yeah you know what? you know i like you i really mean it i really do like you
you do you love me?
do i love you?
that's the key question
yeah
i know you've only known me a short while
well i certainly i think that's very yeah yeah  yeah do you love me?
go on  good so far
iuh love is uh is too weak a word for what
yeah
i love you  you know i loove you ii love you  ii have to invent of course i love you
yeah
don't you think i do?
whatta you mean? you're not gonna give up your own apartment are you?
of course
yeah bububut why?
well i mean i'm moving in with you that's why
yeah but youyou got a nice apartment
word
i have a tiny apartment
yeah i know it's small
that's right and it's got bad plumbing and bugs
all right granted it has bad plumbing and bugs but youyou say that like it's a negative thing you know bugs areareuh entomology is a  rapidly growing field
you don't want me to live with you?
how i don't want you to live with me? how whose idea was it?
mine
yeah was it it was yours actually but uh i approved it immediately
i guess you think that i talked you into something huh? 
how is it any different?
so let's take this great form this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium
that little apartment is four hundred dollars a month alvy
that place is four hundred dollars a month?
yes it is
it'sit's got bad plumbing and bugs jesus i'llmy accountant will write it off as a tax deduction i'll pay for it
you don't think i'm smart enough to be serious about
then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like i was dumb or something?
does this sound like a good course? uh "modern american poetry"? uh or uhlet's see now maybe i should uh take "introduction to the novel"
just don't take any course where they make you read beowulf
no don't be silly whatwhat do we need other people for?  you know we shouldwe should just turn out the lights you know and play hide and seek or something
well okay well listen i'm gonna get a cigarette okay?
the name of the show?
yeah grass right? the illusion that it will make a white woman more like billie holiday
well have you ever made love high?
me no you iiyou know if i have grass or alcohol or anything i get unbearably wonderful i get too too wonderful for words you know i don'ti don't know why you have to uh get high every time we make love
it relaxes me
oh youyou have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
well what's the difference anyway?
well i'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal you can sleep through it
oh come on look who's talking you've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years  you should smoke some o' this you'd be off the couch in no time
what are you doing?
no no no what you can once you can live without it once come on
it is called: mantan  the new millennium minstrel show
oh no alvy please alvy please  m'mrnm
m'm wait i got a great idea  hang in there for a second i got a littlelittle artifact a little erotic artifact thatthat i brought up from the city which i think uh is gonna be perfect  i just there there's a little old new orleans essence nownow we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to there now there  m'mmm m'mmm hey is something wrong?
uhuhwhy?
i don't know you it's like you're you're removed
really?
uhuh
i don't know but you seem sort of distant
let's just do it all right?
oh you have my body
yeah but that's notthat's no good i want the whole thing
i'm feelin' dis'
well i need grass and so do you
well it ruins it for me if you have grass  because you know i'm like a comedian
m'hm
so if i get a laugh from a person who's high it doesn't count you know'cause they're always laughin'
were you always funny?
alvy you were alvy you were just great i'm not kidding it was you were so neat
cccoll college audiences are so wonderful
yeah yeah and you know something? i think that i'm starting to get more of your references too
are yuh?
yeah
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air  in fact i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial
you're so sure about it
yeah i know they'll hate me immediately  thank you
no i don't think so no i don't think they're gonna hate you at all on the contrary i think
yeah
you followed me i can't believe it
i didn't follow you
you followed me
why? 'cause i was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? that's not following
well what is your definition of following?
following is different i was spying
answer the phone
don't worry about that that's my department  now who do we cast? we need a star  can whoopi sing or dance?
do you realize how paranoid you are?
paranoid? i'm looking at you you got your arms around another guy
that is the worst kind of paranoia
yeahwell i didn't start out spying ii thought i'd surprise yuh pick you up after school
yeahwell you wanted to keep the relationship flexible remember? it's your phrase
oh stop it but you were having an affair with your college professor that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "contemporary crisis in western man"
"existential motifs in russian literature" you're really close
what's the difference? it's all mental masturbation
hey don't knock masturbation it's sex with someone i love
we're not having an affair he's married he just happens to think i'm neat
i don't know if whoopi is the way to go
"neat" there's that what are you twelve years old? that's one o' your chippewa falls expressions "he thinks i'm neat"
who cares? who cares?
you've always had hostility toward david ever since i mentioned him
david? you call your teacher david?
it's his name
i'm home
oh yeah? how'd it go?
oh it was  really weird but she's a very nice woman
yeah?
and i didn't have to lie down on the couch alvy she had me sitting up so i told her aboutabout thethe family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother
that's a great handle
m'm

m'hm
ggo on i'm interested
well she said that i was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage andand children
m'hm

tsch rea all this happened in the first hour?
m'hm
mantan and sleep 'n eat  two real coons  i know we're way out there but it's satire

yeah?
and i keep you know it's
every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons  mantan and sleep 'n eat  the dusky duo
well well sure because he's a singer and you're a singer you know so it's perfect so you're trying to suffocate yourself itit makes perfect sense uh uh that's a perfect analytic kind of insight

yeah yeah yeah you because in the dream i break sinatra's glasses
sinatra had gl you never said sinatra had glasses so whatta you saying that ii'm suffocating you?

i mean i tried everything you know iii put on soft music and my my red light bulb and
but the thing isi mean since our discussions here i feel i have a right to my own feelings i think you woulda been happy because uh uh i really asserted myself
the incredible thing about it is i'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and i'm getting screwed
i don't know though i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it so you know so i do feel guilty if i don't go to bed with him but if i do go to bed with him it's like i'm going against my own feelings i don't know ii can't win
you know it's getting expensive my analyst for her analyst she she's making progress and i'm not making any progress her progress is defeating my progress
you never wanna try anything new alvy
how can you say that? i mean  who said iiii said that you i and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome
that's sick

yeah and gradually you get old and die you know it's important to make a little effort once in a while
don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
alvy uh let's face it you know something don't think our relationship is working
whose "catcher in the rye" is this?
well let's see now if it has my name on it then i guess it's mine
oh it sure has you know you wrote your name in all my books 'cause you knew this day was gonna come
well uh alvy you wanted to break up just as much as i do
there's nono question in my mind i think we're doing the mature thing without any doubt
now look all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine
and every week these alabama porch monkeys will make us cry make us laugh make us look at our own humanity  make us feel good to be alive
this "denial of death" you remember this?
oh
god
remember that day?
right geez i feel like there's a great weight off my back m'mmm
thanks honey
yeah my analyst thinks this move is keen for me
yeah and ii tru you know i trust her because mymy analyst recommended her
well why should i put you through all my moods and hangups anyway?
right and youand you know what the beauty part is?
i don't know about that plantation angle
what?
we can always come back together again because there's nothere's no problem 'cause right
exactly but exactly ooooh
you know iii don't think many couples could handle this you know they could just break up and remain friends
hey this one's mine this button this one you rem
yeah
you look very pretty
oh no i just lost a little weight that's all  well you look nice
you see ii've been thinking about it and i think that we should get married
oh alvy come on

why? you wanna live out here all year? it's like living in munchkin land
well whatta you mean? i mean it's perfectly fine out here i mean tony's very nice and uh well i meet people and i go to parties and and we play tennis i mean that's that's a very big step for me you know?  i mean  i'm able to enjoy people more
so whatta you you're not gonna come back to new york?
what's so great about new york? i mean it's a dying city you read "death in venice"
hey you didn't read "death in venice" till i bought it for yuh
that's right that's right  you only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles
that's right 'cause it's an important issue
alvy you're incapable of enjoying life you know that? i mean your life is new york city you're just this person you're like this island unto yourself
i can't enjoy anything unless i unless everybody is iyou know if one guy is starving someplace that's you know ii it puts a crimp in my evening  so wanna get married or what?
no we're friends i wanna remain friends
we think so
okay  check please can i can i can i can i
you're mad aren't you?
no  yes of course i'm mad because you love me i know that
alvy i can't say that that's true at this point in my life i really just can't say that that's true i mean you know how wonderful you are i mean you know you're the reason that i got outta my room and that i was able to sing andand and you know get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap anyway look i don't wanna listen listen listen uh  h'h so whatta you up to anyway huh?
you mean that  iiii flew three thousand miles to see you
i'm late
if you must know it's a hectic time for tony the grammys are tonight
the what?
the grammys he's got a lotta records up for awards
you mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
i strongly feel that a negro should direct this  this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm one misstep and we're doing "amos and andy"  only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain
oh
alvy
oh hi duane how's it goin'?
this is my room
oh yeah?  terrific
i tell you this because as an artist i think you'll understand sometimes when i'm driving on the road at night i see two headlights coming toward me fast i have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly headon into the oncoming car i can anticipate the explosion  the sound of shattering glass the flames rising out of the flowing gasoline
what'd i do?
step up here
what'd i do?
why i was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity
i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself if not the pilot soon after
sixyearold boys don't have girls on their minds
why couldn't you have been more like donald?  now there was a model boy
yeah two more chairs and they got a diningroom set
why are you so hostile?
'cause i wanna watch the knicks on television
i'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for dysentery
commentary
oh really i heard that commentary and dissent had merged and formed dysentery
here you are there's people out there
hey you wouldn't believe this two minutes ago the knicks are ahead fourteen points and now  they're ahead two points
i want a hot young white director maybe the kid that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video
alvy what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
alvy don't you're using sex to express hostility
"whywhy do you always rreduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere"
oh i'm sorry
don't get upset
jesus last night it was some guy honking his car horn i mean the city can't close down you know whatwhatta yuh gonna do hhave 'em shut down the airport too? no more flights so we can have sex?
i'm too tense i need a valium my analyst says i should live in the country and not in new york
well i can't li we can't have this discussion all the time the country makes me nervous there's you got crickets and itit's quiet there's no place to walk after dinner and uh there's the screens with the dead moths behind them and uh yuh got thethe manson family possibly yuh got dick and terry
hey come on it's quiet now we can we can start again
i can't
you're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
what
my head is throbbing
oh you got a headache
i have a headache
bad?
oswald and ghosts
where are you going?
man that's great that's just great
you catch dylan?
me? no no ii couldn't make it that ni mymy raccoon had hepatitis
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
you have a raccoon?
tsch a few
the only word for this is trans plendid it's transplendid
i can think of another word
he's god i mean this man is god he's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment
really? it must be a tremendous hem
i'm a rosicrucian myself
are you?
yeah
i can't get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics look  there's god coming outta the men's room
besides what does he know about negroes?
it's unbelievably transplendid i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy remember?
i hope you don't mind that i took so long to finish
oh no no don't be tsch don't be silly you know  i'm startin' iti'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now
oh sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience
oh tsch thank you h'm
i mean that as a compliment
i thinki think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm you know to make up for empty areas in life
who said that?
you know it must need to have had its leading from one thought to another you know what i'm talking about?
he's screaming his opinions in my ear
probably nuthin' but that's why it's such a sexy way to go sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective  a black director y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  with this kid the possibilities are endless
like all that juliet of the spirits or satyricon i found it incredibly indulgent you know he really is he's one of the most indulgent film makers he really is
key word here is "indulgent"
without getting well let's put it this way
it's like samuel beckett you know i admire the technique but he doesn't he doesn't hit me on a gut level
probably on their first date right?
it's a narrow view
i never read that that wasthat was henry james right? novel uh the sequel to turn of the screw? my sexual
it's the influence of television yeah now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being aa high uh high intensity you understand?  a hot medium as opposed to a
what i wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure
wait a minute why can't i give my opinion? it's a free country
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video?
i mean d he can give you do you hafta give it so loud? i mean aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? and and the funny part of it is m marshall mcluhan you don't know anything about marshall mcluhan's work
wait a minute really? really? i happen to teach a class at columbia called "tv media and culture" so i think that my insights into mr mcluhan well have a great deal of validity
oh do yuh?
yes
oh
thank you very much it's a pleasure
this is a great house really everything saunas jacuzzis three tennis courts you know who the original owners were? nelson eddy then legs diamond then you know who lived here?
charlie chaplin
hey
uh you guys are stilluh you're still new yorkers
why didn't you tell me?

anouk isn't like a dog really  more like a small person  so is there anyone here for me?  no one looks new  who's that?
you don't want that  it's married and it's the neighbor
oh i think he's cute  how's the marriage part working out?
you're fucking desperate

jack  did you compose that yourself?

absolutely not
it has your ring
what's that?
can we one at a time?  hold it down and one at a time  you're last cal
it's going  it's going
isn't skye amazing?
she's got great tits
son  good to seeya  good to seeya
she's a constant surprise
and you've only just met

absolutely  and she's got great tits
yeah god she really does have great tits great tits  i can't wait to work with her
the camera loves her  a great actress
poor mac  it's been a bit of a struggle i'm sure sally's told you
no what?
the movie
oh she's really enjoying it  i think is mac okay?
it's been a long time
i don't know what's going on  i don't care to guess  mac's really unhappy she isn't there that's all  she's no idea what she's playing not a clue
who sally?
and you know it isn't rocket science this script  she can barely get the lines out  there was a scene last week  she sobbed through every take  i know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy joe  something's gone  you know that thing that was sally  that always surprised you  it's gone  i think she's scared  and that's death
i still think she sails above the rest i mean not like her early films  but those were all such great directors
mac's a pretty great director joe  he's a woman's director  and nothing's happening  course he won't fire her because of the friendship but it was discussed  he had to battle his studio to get her in the first place
what?
hey listen i love her  she's sophia's best friend  i never said any of this alright  i'll deny it on the stand  you guys are gonna have kids  that is so great  maybe that's what this is all about  maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore  you know adults don't do this for a living  you guys are gonna have your kids you'll be directing  one asshole in the family is enough  sophia knew that intuitively  look at clair clair's a mess  make sure she gets the epidural  forget that natural childbirth shit everything's going to be what it's supposed to be  "life is but a walking shadow  a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more" and speaking of me the role of leo in your film?
leo?
any thoughts on casting yet?
leo?  it was out to jude law  jude passed
yeah
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
well i can't make any promises and of course i haven't read the script but i loved the novelwhen are you shooting?
octoberish
i have a small window of time
leo  leo's twentyeight cal
scratch the two write in a four
scratch the two write in a four
you've got a lot of fucking gall  thirty nine
she already has
so they tell me  not soon enough of course  how are you sal?  you look fantastic it changes your life you know  a baby it puts everything in perspective doesn't it  doesn't it mac?  you can't be the center of your own world anymore
mac?  oh there you are  what are you doing honey?  no more work  don't you feel breezy
good woman  i trained her right
i'm in mourning
you can cut around it whatever it is you always do
not this time
you don't have any clothes on
how nice for everybody  come swimming the water's glorious  you'll fix it  you'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas
or i won't  i can't help her  i'm out of my depth
things always look much worse in the morning
i don't know how to make her funny
you're coming swimming in the pool and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about  you won't care who's in your damn movie
what what's about?
daddy she's younger than me
honey?
what a fucking day  we only just got a sitter  i don't know her from fucking adam  she could be a serial killer  i'm going to have to call every ten minutes you have to let me give out the number
i'm not
why didn't you bring him?
what?
why didn't you bring him?
he's allergic
oh
to dander  otis
oh
purely for medicinal purposes
didn't i say?
well probably
they can tell from the eyelashes you know?  he's got eyelashes yay long  they must be a foot long  the older you are when you have a baby the more likely this stuff is to crop up
it sounds hysterical but otis just rubbed up against me and i'd kind of like to change into something of yours  you know it could be disaster  he's so allergic  it's terrifying
borrow whatever you like
i'll change back before we leave
whatever you like  i'm afraid it'll all be too big for you  are you alright clair?
i'm fine  i'm fine  well i'm a little stressed  and i've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby
i'd say it was down
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy  i've got a ghastly headache actually
i did  i'm not an alcoholic  i just like to drink
you want a tylenol or something?
i'd love a xanex  sally please don't tell sophia that i'm not breast feeding
why would she care?
you know sophia  she's so damned judgemental  and she's so damned perfect  and so fucking serene  just fucking don't tell her  because you know mac thinks she's god  and i can feel him comparing
you need to knock off the pills clair
just don't fucking tell her
thank you thank you thank you
you look so well clair  a wraith
you think so?  i've been working out a lot since the baby and i've been working  and that takes it's toll you know
i'm glad that's all over for me
how did you end up here?
don't you miss it?
never
really
not for a second  cal can have all that
really?
so where is young jonah?
what is that thing?
so this sitter can always reach me  i'm still not used to leaving him
you should have brought him
dander  he's allergic  otis
that's what i'm askin'
oh  do you have any pictures?
pictures  they're always in my tote  i left my tote in the damn trailer  but he's mac all over again  imagine mac shrunk to twoandahalf feet  the fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth
are you the funniest person i know or what?
let's get the kids
thanks for coming
would you leave us alone right now?
he's gonna miss his flight
is he not going?  i booked a flight
he's not going tonight
i told his father he'd be on that flight
because i had too much pride  too much integrity  i wouldn't lick nobody's butt  some material i refused to do
well you could tell him otherwise  it was good of you to be all this help  but he doesn't want to go tonight
jesus sally  i'm not the enemy
and you're not the wife
it's not a contest
take good care of it
i'm the hired help
fuck you
i never put myself in harm's way
anymore

that's the only reason period they only want one certain kind of black comic
what a nose  you missed your calling

it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden
ow  gina you obviously need to get fucked

you only made half your quote this year
well you're a tower of support
i worry because you don't  it's my job i'm feeling guilty  i would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground
we couldn't be on more solid ground

of course we do  we have to sign our taxes
otis  no barking
in the kitchen
yes
well not yet  the gate was open?
two minutes
not that often  he was excited to see you
still champions
it's an unfair advantage
you've got cal  you've got gina  you've got skye?  we're the leftovers
okay knock it off
truce?
truce
dinner  don't be angry
not properly watered
dolphins  great
i think we should all take it tonight everyone's staying stays  no driving that's the rule  i love you sallymae you're going to have a fabulous time
so he drank himself into a stuper?
someone left the goddamn gate open  otis got out  skye and i well the i came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open
don't be so sure
listen to yourself  don't worry it's alright  we'll find him  what's wrong with you?
she left the fucking gate open
well he can't have gone far
can't have gone far?  he's like a greyhound  he could be miles away
he'll find his way back
there are fucking coyotes out there
fuck you
otis
the drinking is for the pain  it doesn't kill it just dulls it
otis
otis good boy come here  oh my god oh my god oh my god
this is a nightmare  we should have kept him upstairs
it was done  when sophia put the kids to bed america brought otis in the room and closed the door  it was done
well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate
oh fuck you and fuck monica while you're at it  but i guess that's what i interrupted
jesus sally  you are a medical miracle the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier
yeah let's talk about that  you seem to be rather an expert  i don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties
rave parties?  that's so typical  you would think it was called rage  perfect
what else don't i know about joe?  let's get really clear here
so what's up with you?
sally so i took a few pills  i went out dancing  i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you  i haven't lied to you  i told you about the people i've slept with  i just didn't mention the few occasions i took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental i knew i'd never hear the end of it and you have so little faith and so little trust in me  sally we're back i love you  trust that  please let's not do this
otis  come  good boy  come
otis
i'm not sure we understand that word in the same way
love?
you walked out on a five year marriage
that hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love  it's whether we can live together like this  all the time
it's not like this all the time
do i want anyone else?  no  do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  i'm trying
and how hard it hit?
don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it
just stop right there sally  we've been through this
you've been through it  that's how you love people  when it's easy for you when it's convenient for you
sally first of all you're talking bullshit  and second
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week  she's a fucking mess joe  your sister is a fucking mess  she needs you  i talk to her more than you do
that is not true
it is true  you know how you love joe? you dedicate a book to someone
every novel i've had published in every language i've dedicated to lucy
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part?  have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  i'm an actress  it's about our marriage for fuck's sake  everybody knows that
it's a novel
about me
he never showed it
who the fuck do you think you are?  the part of genna is not just about you it's about every woman i've ever loved in my entire life  including my mother the character is also clearly in her early twenties sally
what are you saying?
hello?  last birthday was?
i don't look my age joe
sally i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it  and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently
it's a shit novel anyway
well there you go  i let you off the hook  you're one goddamn lucky actress
not really  i mean your books have always been pop but this is the shallowest of the bunch  that's what all our friends think anyway
okay  if we could've by some miracle stripped ten years off your face still couldn't have got the thing made because i don't mean anything as a director and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore  and the people that can hire you are afraid to because they think you're phoning it in  that you don't have oh christ sally
who?  who?  who thinks that?
how was it?
your director and your costar of your current movie  don't dish if you can't take it sally
cal too?
sally for christ's sake
anyone else?
this is insanity  sally
don't
don't push me away
i had an abortion two weeks ago
don't do this
i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me
why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
don't do this
i told you when we met i never wanted children  i don't want kids in my life we talked about it  you weren't listening
you changed your mind
you think this was to hurt you?  my god joe  it isn't about you
what?  you aborted our child?
i'm a monster  exactly
you're not ready
don't make allowances  i'll never be ready  some people just shouldn't have children  i'd be a terrible fucking mother joe  i did want it for us  but i couldn't do it  i don't really think i can do it
i wasn't part of that picture at all was i?  i wasn't part of that decision  did i occur to you at all?  it's a fucking farce  it's a fucking farce  how long did you think you could keep it going you're amazing  do you have any idea what you've done to us?
yes
nobody told me anything
i'll never forgive you
i know
alright good  thanks for your trouble so will you leave sally and me alone right now?
i can't got tonight  i don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight
i'll be with you
i don't want to go tonight
no
okay
pretty much a disaster tonight wasn't it?
i guess
no  go ahead  you're gonna be great
what good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
life gets messy  ugly messy  but i don't understand you  and i don't think i ever understood lucy  i don't understand throwing it away  how do you throw all that away?  any of it  i want it all  you guys want guarantees?  i want the possibilities  and all kinds of crap comes with that  a lot of bad shit and i think that's okay with me because because of the rest of the stuff  all the good shit  all the surprises  it's a fucking miracle when you come down to it  we'd have had amazing children you and me  we'd have had a ride  you'd have surprised yourself  i'll never love anybody else you know
me too
that's under lock and key
happy anniversary

i love gifts  what did you guys get us?
how did you know?
nothing that can't be exchanged
oh  well  good
congratulations on the deal  how exciting  is sally doing sally?  i mean it's sally  the character that's based on sally  the character that's based on sally in the book
the novel  no skye davidson is playing the lead
oh my god i'm a huge skye davidson fan she's very beautiful
yes she is
but i am right yes?  she's based on sally
it's a novel
still  well  let's drop it
yes
it hit me like a ton of bricks
i'm not much of a reader but i do love autobiographies even biographies sometimes  mostly nonfiction  did you read the new styron?
no
it's very good  i understand you won the booker prize
yes i did
is your script much like the novel? jerry says it's very good  but you know you read the novel and then you see the movie  and most of the time you say "what's this?" you know?  i sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all  because we come with expectations and of course we know where we're going  don't you find?
don't i find what?
i don't know why joe we've known each other how long
not long
don't be silly
joking
how can this be?  you and me at the same time the exact same thought it's scary
yes i know  i started to say i started to say joe that 
do i put you off?
you manage to throw me off balance  i adore you
and i you
but i'm always afraid i'll say something stupid
ah
and so i always manage to do you see? like the book/script thing do you see?
the infamous dog?
he's the best dog in the world  they're both coming tonight  not my idea
ours
manray was under our nose the whole time
you lose this?
you got your dp?
what?  oh yeah the camera man?  they gave me a list
and you got skye davidson  pretty big leagues for a first timer  do you even like movies?
not particularly  weird isn't it?  god i'm rally up  do you feel anything yet mac?
kind of  hey look  john seale oliver stapelton darius khonji  they're friends  and great dp's i could give them a call for you
thanks mac  and thanks for being so supportive about all this  i really love you you know
hey i'm happy for you buddy  anything i can do
well you knowgood days bad days
i meant sally
do you know how you will use him?
i meant sally
oh  you're serious
no  no  let me tell you something  directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood  the sleep depravation alone
please ryan
something soft
your eames table is incredible  and the b&b  i just put that in a client's home actually but in red
you're an interior decorator right?
sally did all this herself?
in fits and starts  and then later of course she had to accommodate me  so things shifted a little bit then became more eclectic  and it keeps changing
mmm  it says something about the two of you maybe
you lost me
yeah we're in a constant state of flux  i see you've moved up from the soft stuff
oh yes  you know ryan's been sober eight years  and it's difficult if i you know  it's better if i don't
uhhuh
i'm a little nervous so
oh
a little out of my element
no you're not
well yes  yes in fact  a little on the outside yes  and there's been all this friction
hm
i don't know why but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating
dunwitty wants a coon show  and that's what i'm going to give him it's going to be so racist so negative he won't have the balls to put it on the air  hence i'll prove my point
very well put
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort
what?
but you're very private people  you know there's a kind of elitism
elitism?
the wrong word maybe  delete that and you know the dog barks incessantly
and you know he really does not
and ryan works at home
oh shit  i'm sorry
well that's what ryan thought  i was more generous actually
what point is that?
easy tiger
alright  please don't tell ryan i'm drinking
scout's honor
would you sign it for me  i'm sure this is inappropriate
i need to leave you now
i will treasure this
are you okay?
i don't think so  i feel  i feel a bit funny
i've never done this before
oh?  it's easy  you just put one foot in front of the other that's a good girl
no  no listen to me here  i want to know what you're talking about  you know the shoe thing and the marriages and
the point being that him the networks don't want black people on television unless they are buffoons
i'm a little in the puke zone
here drink this  drink lots of water  hold on to this  take deep breaths nice and slow  would you like a lolly?
what am i five?
you're never too old for a lolly  i'm having one
lemon or raspberry?
lemon
ryan's really angry with me
i think he's really angry with me too
it's really not the same thing  he was really nicer when he drank
i'm sorry
sounds risky to me
eight years though  that's quite an accomplishment
that's a lot of those
medallions
a lot of cakes
yes
and he doesn't smoke?
he has to find nonsmoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible you know? it's gotten much better
how long have you been married?
ninenine yes?  nine years just about
you must have been a baby
you getting cold feet?
oh yes  nineteenjust  i'm cold
that's very nice
i like you
i'm so glad  you know i recognize that passage in your book  the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre
sorry?
i know you changed it to a bookstore and the color of my hair  but the moment was exactly the same  the same you know dynamic  and almost verbatim wasn't it?
yeah it was  for a writer nothing's sacred  no nothing at all
stop being such a bitch sal
i'm so sorry
how do you do skye?
i'm in till the end
oh i love that  i'm just great  i'm so happy to be here and i apologize for invading you  and i'm so happy you asked me to  i'm so touched  i know how private you and sally are
yeah well it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends
when i read your work i felt that you knew me  women must tell you that  and this one in particular speaks to me do you know?  i am genna  how many women must tell you that  and the script is wonderful  wonderful and lean and visual
i'm so happy you like it  i'm so relieved you said yes and i'm really um what thrilled yes actually to finally meet you
i think there are sixteen there
of course it's alright
what?
i didn't say a word
i was faking it  i've been feeling caged for sometime  funny huh?
jesus christ
good  i'm going to need your support
how's he doing?
ryan
well yes actually
i love it here  don't you love it here ryan?  i love it here  and i love tonight  and i love these people  and this feels utterly fantastic ryan  utterly fantastic
you know what sally therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  she didn't pull that out of thin air  it causes brain damage  you'd better drink a lot of water
do you want to go home ryan?
yes
i think you should then  you should look in on sheila
i'm not going to leave you alone
they're really nice people ryan they're like us
can't you just quit?  walk away?
they're nothing like us
are you making an ass of yourself?
there's only you ryan  you know what ryan?  you're beautiful  i love you so much you need
i don't need a drug
ready to go?
ryan you've got to come  you've got to help me find the dog  i let their dog out  we need to find the dog
you're not serious
i left the gate open and otis got out he could get hit by a car
god willing
we have to find the dog ryan
maybe something happened to them maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death
why?
because we're nice people and because what goes around comes around  because god help you if something happens to that dog?
excuse me?
jesus christ it's a fucking dog
don't go in ryan
what?
hi  monica and ryan?
sally?
we could hardly say no
ryan
hello
hors d'oeuvres or something?
yes great  it's a beautiful house
thank you  i understand you're an interior decorator
yes
i so wish i'd known
well whoever did this is amazing
i'm sorry
there's a goddamn sign on the gate
i'm so sorry
you fucking cow can't you read?
you okay?
i
come on in
and i'm overwhelmed  and i want to do it justice  and i hope we can spend time together  and i'm gushing  it's my worst quality
not at all
oh my god  i've been so rude  i'm skye davidson  has anyone ever told you you look like peter sellers?
is there space here?
yes
do you need anything else?
i was impressed
oh?
what is your problem?
the charades
thank you
that was my clue
oh?
the shostakovich
really??
otis  shostakovich identified with the jew  he felt persecuted hunted crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism
not to mention andrew zhdanov otis come
andre zhdanov?  how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov?
who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music  shostakovich prokofieve and myaskovsky
i'll tell you tonight  let's do it tonight  as soon as you get back we'll talk  we'll talk
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
i'll tell you who doesn't know cute girls don't know
do peter sellers again
otis you crazy dog  otis are you in this god forsaken canyon?  my people are very hungry
i just did a movie about bob yar i played gittle the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head and they used shostakovich's 13th symphony
set to the poem of yetveshenko
exactly  so i dug it and i did a lot of research
do you really you really like shostakovich?
yeah
would you like marry him?
if he were still alive maybe
why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
how about someone who really really liked shostakovich?
are you asking me to marry you?
no i'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are
very
oh good i'm worse are you really twentytwo?
good you brought your violin  i want you to play
it's a machine gun  i thought i'd kill myself
are you lovesick?
suicidal  it's much less codependent
will champagne help?
it was the principle  dunwitty had to be enlightened  i was making a point  i take pride in my work plus i already told you i wasn't gonna walk away from my money
panes is here
she's even better looking in the flesh
oh jesus panes  i can't i can't believe that bitch is in my house
you don't know she's a bitch
she's all over him are you blind?
it could be worse
how?
she could be playing the role in joe's movie that should be yours
fuck you panes
you see that's worse
even if money wasn't an issue dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous
i just wanted tonight to be with the people we love
like your business managers?
they're not just our business managers panes
oh okay forgive me  your neighbors are here for fuck's sake
exactly what i mean  it's all ruined
it's not ruined for fuck's sake  it's one of your parties
i don't want it to be just one of our parties
"how are you really doing panes?" "lousy thank you i'm falling apart"
like the last time
no  no not like the last time  she was the rest of my life
what's the chances of mantan being picked up?
like the last time
i wasn't finished
okay
"we can't stand seeing you like this panes  i hate you being alone  why don't you stay with us for a while?" "i'd love to thanks"
it's our anniversary panes
i didn't hear me say tonight
we're just feeling our way back
"otherwise we'd insist on your being here"
everyday
shit
i wouldn't bet against it  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
i'd cut off her red wine if i were you
shit  it's my galiano
what does that mean?
so how are you really doing panes?
why don't you go fuck yourself?
no  really  for real  really
i'm worried about your galiano
you're a shit

you're keeping a record are you?
well the neighborhood is full of dogs and it's not always otis
monica and ryan

oh  well yes  it's extraordinary  you think you could sign it for us?
oh my god sorry  i'm interrupting
i don't think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center
happy anniversary  thank you for making me a part of it
which one is your brother?
you don't need to do that
i don't mind
enough about me
oh my god  america told me your neighbors are coming?
and here they are
he's a novelist
ah
like joe
hmm  where are my kids?
in the guest room  i've laid out a paint table for them
promise?
you've said that already
i hope they're watercolors
nevermind
isn't this a fabulous picture?
yes
she's such a great photographer
hm
so where should i put it?
i thought it was okay where it was
it's much more personal in here
a notch above the storage room
just want to say good luck
we're always in here  she really gets him doesn't she?
the both of you
but she really gets to the heart of joe doesn't she?  she's a genius
so how much do you hate her?
well i don't trust her  i never have
she took our wedding photos for chrissakes  you don't trust anyone
i trust you
oh soph
you'll hate it in london  it's wet and miserable  a medical hellhole sally it's socialized  beds in the corridors terrible plumbing
and the food sucks i know
your life will never be the same
you are not having your baby in london you're going to have your baby at cedars in beverly hills america delivered by dr milton cohen  period and you're getting that epidural right away don't let anyone talk you into any of that lamase bullshit  there's no excuse for pain like that
sophia  i'm not even pregnant
well good  thank god
let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone
what do you mean thank god?
well are you sure about this baby thing? it's not the ticking clock shit is it?
no no not at all i mean i've still got plenty of time  don't i?  i mean i still have a good six years whatever we could have three kids yet if we wanted  and i know i've always said i never wanted kids and i didn't but this year i really truly feel ready
honey i'm not worried about you  you are going to be a fantastic mom  not an issue  i pressed you remember?  joe on the other hand is a different story
oh soph joe loves kids  joe wants kids joe thinks he needs kids
he wants playmates  oh he's a sweetheart sal you know i love him but he's not going to be a good father he's just not parenting material
let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready
don't try and change the subject  oh god it feels great  he's just a little narcissistic irresponsible and unreliable
and cal's this massive adult?
cal knows who he is  did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
you weren't exactly horrified
i don't have a drug problem
neither does joe
you don't have kids to keep a marriage together sally  it's only five months since joe came back
we're fine  we're great  we're having a baby and we're moving to london
well you weren't fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut
not nice  not kind
we both lied to him
ha  not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel
why are you doing this?
his image of you is a possessive fragile neurotic
but i am a possessive fragile neurotic
sorry azteca  here you go fellas fresh dirt  alley oop  shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  i mean this dirt is verydirty doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  boy am i hungry  i'm so hungry i'm seeing double  it looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here  when's lunch?  tomorrow or the day after?
z old pal  shut up  it's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day
the squeaky wheel gets the oil
no z  the squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u> alright?  you're a good ant z even though you are a pain in my rear segment  i don't wanna see anything happen to you  so quit mouthing off before you get in trouble
break's over
this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground  why are we even digging this thing?
what do you want me to say?
hey slow it down big boy  you're making the rest of us look badhow come i haven't seen you around here before?
i'm newi was born yesterday
tell me about it
nobody told me digging was so much fun  you pick up the dirt you move it you pick it up again you move it again  lots of repetitions you exercise the forceps and the pincers 
i don't know what came over me talking back like that  i must be going crazy
sorry i got you in trouble  but listen you can share my rations
are you asking me out to dinner?
no  i mean yes  i mean  if you don't have other plans
wait a minute that's no soldier  that's z
you know you're not just workers  you can be whatever you want to be look at z  he started as a worker  then he became a soldier
same here
well because he's more than a workerhe's awhat did he call it azteca
invisible
someone who follows his heart
general  we have to talk sometime
so umhow was your day?  what did you do?
well  i declared war
he'she's dead  you don't have to look for him anymore  he was eaten by a praying mantis
it's a shame he died prematurelyi was hoping to kill him myself
well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now  i miss him already
you miss him?  <u>why</u>?
i want to apologize about my brother and the maumau's  i should not have imposed them on you
what a bunch of losers  mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system 
so uh  how come i haven't seen you around here before?
i work in the palace i don't get out much
the palace hunh?  i bet those royals really live it up  of course they're all a little you know from inbreeding 
are you sure this is a real dance?
well actually uh  i'm sort of making it up 
really?
why should everyone dance the same way?  it's as exciting as watching fungus grow
you're right
you  you think i'm right?
who's side are you on?
you watch yours soldier or my worker friend will beat you up
oh that's okay i'll let him off this time  are you crazy?  this guy's built like a pebble  you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays 
uh oh  goodbye  gotta run
wait  when can i see you again?
you're the hero of the recent termite campaign aren't you?
and you are?
i'm princess bala
ah yes  well charmed i'm sure  so princess have you ever danced with a hero?
yes
no general  i'm dancing with the war hero
what would their reaction be?  i hadn't the foggiest
you dance
divinely?
he was a worker  i danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day i'm not shocking you am i?
noas a matter of fact
gee uh could you say it a little louder i think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you
i can't dance with a worker
that's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> 
quiet  sshhh
 at the <u>worker bar</u>  you were pretty hot to trot then
what <u>was</u> that thing?
i promise  we'll talk  you'll be great  you'll be fine  go ahead just imagine that uh just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me
so you have your small victory now what?
how should <u>i know</u>?
i order you to find out where we are
excuse me i   pardon me   and they call them social insects
i've been kidnapped by the village idiot
who's the bigger idiot  the idiot who gets kidnapped or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
theoretically yes  but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
of course  it defines society  to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself
but can there be a society composed of just two ants?
no  there's no such thing as "just two ants"  you never see just two ants  you see a million ants
i  <u>hate</u>  you
what is this?
well i guess that makes us even
ha  don't make me laugh  you're crazy about me  that's why you lied and cheated to get near me
oh come on <u>you're</u> the one who came after me  the swarthy earthy sensual worker
i was <u>slumming it</u>  i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place
is that the same standard you used to choose general formica?
now worker you shall take me back to the colony and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole
well that's an appealing offer butconsidering the options  you go back  me i'm going to insectopia
<u>insectopia</u>?  you stupid worker that's just a fairy tale
yeah well i have it on a reliable source  that it exists  now you follow the yellow egg  <u>that</u> direction
worker  come back here now
a gift
i've got a <u>name</u>  it's <u>z</u>
waterwater
waterwater  oh you already said that
my skin's dry my exoskeleton is crackingi wish i'd never met you you ruined my life
we're going to die
why didn't i listen to my mother why'd i have to go looking for trouble? any ant would have given their left legs to be in my positionwhat's <u>wrong</u> with me?
want a list?
this lake is huge  and so close to the colony  think of the vacation potential
cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap
out here i'm just what?
for what?
hlllllllp
princess has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
general formica won't let me die out here  i'm his fiancee
look  how many other princesses are there?
five thousand three hundred and ninety  no  about five thousand four hundred by now
and only you can become a queen?
wellno but 
so what makes you so special?
face it z we're lost  we must have walked halfway across the world by now  how did i get into this mess
come ontell me there wasn't just a littlesomething between us that first night at the bar  the night we danced
the jolly nigger bank
we've found it  <u>insectopia</u>  look at all this food'
you were rightyou were right  z it's <u>beautiful</u>
zif we don't make iti just want you to know
yes?
come on z
soyou never did tell mewhat made you come out to the worker bar that night?
just looking for fun adventure trouble i guess
sorry it's been through a war not to mention everything else
you held onto this all that time?
why do they have you tied up here?
this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
bala that  that lake we found  i think the tunnel's right underneath it   formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>  that's what he meant when said there were too many ants
z  what are you doing?
i mean i've got the whole package right?  a great life a beautiful wife and a few kids
the club's so <u>stuffy</u>  i want to try someplace different
there isn't anyplace else   except the worker bar
we shouldn't be doing this  it isn't proper
i'm the princess aren't i?
of course 
and do princesses do improper things?
of course not 
thanks
bala has always been a hopeless romantic general
i felt the same way before i got married  confused  scared
you did?
yes  but i did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings  the wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged  even marriage  you're lucky  general formica is a paragon of anthood
who is that idiot?
bala
you new kid?
i just joined up  but i'm quitting i got a trial membership
you just stick by old barbatus he'll watch out for you  whatsamatter kid?  leave a girl behind?
yeah  well  no  she's kind of playing hard to get  as a matter of fact she's playing completely unattainable  so what's on the schedule?  a brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
i thought it was appropiate
no  we're going to attack the termites
well what exactly does our platoon do?  serve beverages?  process paperwork?
so we're going back for more armor right?  i mean these guys are from outer space how are we supposed to beat them?
don't be scared kid  barbatus's got yer back
barbatus  you  you saved my life
z  over here
barbatus
be honest kid  am i hurt bad?
no no you'relookin' good you've got good color in your cheeks
no  i can see it in your eyes  i'm a goner  it's alright z  in this ant's army a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus  i can't feel my legs
is that good or bad?
hang in there buddy  you can make it  just  take deep breaths i'll try and find your body  it's gotta be around here somewhere
i wonderwhatwas it allfor
barbatus hang on  barbatus
princess bala sir  your fiancee
actually sir we're ahead of schedule  we have thirtysix seconds available right now
fourteenfifty hours sir
dammit this tunnel is priority a1 we can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project
notice the big one holding hands with the female?
well uh who notices workers sir?
what do we have on this "insectopia"?
it's all good  you got a hit show you're gonna need a bank  plus i love these old black collectibles
scattered reports sir  rumors nothing reliable
desperate times call for desperate measures  get me ant team six
what are you doing?  attack  come on you yellowbellies  don't just stand there carpenter make an example of yourself
so this zhe fancies himself an individual?
yeahi meanwelli don't know really sir
well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality have you?
oh no sir
good  you're a good soldier
so tell me  where's z?
ii have no idea sir
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
yeah  i'll do that  as long as you're not patronizing me
how so?
we know what makes an ant colony strong don't we?  we know that no ant can be an individual  no <u>single</u> ant matters right?
that's correct sir
not that one  or that one
lays it on a little thick doesn't he?  if you ask me he's one giant bore
now i've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>  well you boys are gonna be taken care of  but in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u> we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u> and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>
geez and i forgot my toothbrush
no  you  you don't understand
damn i'm proud of you boy  i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber the world would tremble  now time for some r and r  you're invited to the royal victory party
royal victory party?  willwill princess bala be there?
of course  the entire royal family will be there to honor you
why'd you do that?
son you're an ant after my own heart  a warrior  an ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>
well i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back  so tell me fellow warmongerdo you think princess bala likes men in uniform?
well she better  she's engaged to one  <u>me</u>
engaged?  as in you're getting married?
affirmative
soyou two are in love?
wow what a spread  you know there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony
yes and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
not enough food?
well i i don't think "living it up" is the right term  how about "working themselves to death"?
i don't want to hear it
i tell you son sometimes at night i see myself in battle fighting a horrible faceless enemy with the future of our whole species at stake and always the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart
may i cut in?
what's this?  a <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?
well it wasn't a masquerade really it was more what i'd call a clever ruse 
arrest him
general the severe food shortage that faces the colony<u>pains</u> me the thought of any of my children going hungry  who's the cutest widdle worker?  you are  yes you  don't forget to brush your teeth  ship 'er out  what steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory
yes what else?
no snacking between meals  off you go  now  what were we saying?
i do not recollect your majesty will that be all?
how long have you and hambone been hangin' out?
conversationyeswell  wasn't she briefed?
look general  a darling baby soldier  don't try to be a hero  just make sure you come back in one piece  next
all these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>
your majesty i'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony
but general  this tunnel is your baby  you're sure you can't stay ?
'fraid not your majesty  goodbye your majesty
very well general  i know you  all work and no play
i feelisolated  different  i've got abandonment issues  my father flew away when i was just a larva my mother didn't have much time for mewhen you have five million siblings it's difficult to get attention  i feel physically inadequate  i've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight  sometimes i think i'm just not cut out to be a worker  but i don't have any other options  i was assigned to trade school when i was just a <u>grub</u>  the whole system justmakes me feel<u>insignificant</u>
i should?
ask me why we're so successful
you're the one that put us together we're friends
why are we so successful?
what do you see out there?
ants
you see?  being an ant is being able to say "hey  <u>i'm</u> meaningless <u>you're</u> meaningless"
we declared war again?  are you scared?
did you see that?  how he gave <u>you</u> the beers not me?  i'm telling you he's got something against workers
i don't know what you're talking about z
come on  everybody dumps on us workers  you soldiers get all the glory  plus you get to go out into the world meet interesting insects and kill them
weaver they're career girls they're obsessed with digging  no i'll probably never meet the girl for me
who said there was a girl for you? i was talking about a girl for me  don't you want your aphid beer?
that crazy brother of yours doesn't think so
i can't help it  i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature  call me crazy
z we've known each other a long time right?
of course  you were born two seconds after me
and all the time i've known you you've been grumping and groaning you should quit making waves  go with the flow
hey did you hear what he said?
time to cut a rug z
i'm not in the mood  even when they're off work they follow orders
get real z  she just dropped the scarf by accident
are you kidding?  there were sparks between us  this scarf is a sign
it's a sign that you're crazy  do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
he's just playing big brother
you have to help me  please weaver think of all the things i've done for you
i can't think of any
well i'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you
will you introduce me to some worker girls?
you bet  they'll really go for a sensitive guy like you
wear this
you're a real buddy
yeah i know
what do i do?
yeah but i hate drowning more  now <u>dig</u>
oh is he?  you getting jiggy with mantan?
i'm getting lonely  who are you talking to anyway?
my mother
this the place?
you sure this is a good idea? dobisch can't think of a better one
i mean  barging in on your mother  in the middle of the night?
not there  under the mat
so this is your mother's apartment?
oh  hello there mrs dreyfuss
something the matter?
such a racket i heard in your place  maybe you had burglars
please don't go there
mrs dreyfuss can i borrow some coffee  and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
eggs he asks me for oranges what you need is a good horsewhipping
ma'am?
from me the doctor has no secrets poor girl  how could you do a thing like that?
i didn't really do anything  honest  i mean you take a girl out a couple of times a week  just for laughs  and right away she thinks you're serious  marriagewise
you wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin would you?
well i have some paper towels 
beatnik go to my kitchen  third drawer under the good silver there is napkins
yes mrs dreyfuss he starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two fran is just sitting there the spoon in her hand not touching the soup
you must eat  and you must get healthy  and you must forget him such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here  clean and cut  a regular ivy leaguer turns out he is king farouk mit the drinking  mit the cha cha  mit the no napkins a girl like you for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? who needs it you listen to me you find yourself a nice substantial man  a widower maybe  and settle down  instead of nashing all those sleeping pills  for what for whom?  for some good time charlie?  sssh
dunwitty and i feel you've been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
one napkin coming up  i wish we had some champagne to wrap it around
what did i tell you?
look mrs dreyfuss you don't have to wait around i'll wash the dishes and 
all right  i'll tell him  hey baxter  that was personnel mr sheldrake's secretary
sheldrake?
she's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes they want you up stairs
what gives baxter? you getting promoted or getting fired?
care to make a small wager?
i've been here twice as long as you have 
shall we say  a dollar?
patronizing you nay i love you
i can't lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
morning mr baxter
what did you do to your hair?
it was making me nervous so i chopped it off  big mistake huh?
say you got a lulu
yeah  i better not get too close
oh i never catch colds
really?  i was looking at some figures from the sickness and accident claims division  do you know that the average new yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
that makes me feel just terrible
why?
well to make the figures come out even  since i have no colds a year  some poor slob must have five colds a year
dela you should try it sometime come into the light
you should have stayed in bed this morning
twentyseven
you may not realize it miss kubelik but i'm in the top ten  efficiencywise and this may be the day  promotionwise
you're beginning to sound like mr kirkeby already
why not? now that they're kicking me upstairs 
couldn't happen to a nicer guy  you know you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator
really?
the characters you meet something happens to men in elevators must be the change of altitude  the blood rushes to their head or something  boy i could tell you stories 
i hope everything goes all right
i hope so  wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this  with my cold and everything   how do i look?
light?
good night
oh  miss kubelik  i've been waiting for you fran you have?
i almost didn't recognize you  this is the first time i've ever seen you in civilian clothes
how'd you make out on the twenty seventh floor?
great look  have you seen the music man?
no
would you like to?
sure
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first  and then 
you mean tonight?
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light  this bucket of blood
yeah
i'm sorry but i can't tonight i'm meeting somebody
oh  you mean  like a girlfriend?
i wasn't trying to be personal  it's just that the fellows in the office were  whether you wondering about you ever 
just tell 'em  now and then
this date  is it just a date  or is it something serious?
it used to be serious  at least i was  but he wasn't  so the whole thing is more or less kaputt
well in that case couldn't you  ?
i'm afraid not i promised to have a drink with him  he's been calling me all week 
well it was just an idea  i hate to see a ticket go to waste 
this is crazy
what time does the show go on?
eightthirty
well  i could meet you at the theatre  if that's all right
all right? that's wonderful it's the majestic  44th street
you know i felt so lousy this morning  a hundred and one fever  then my promotion came up  now you and i  eleventh row center  and you said i should have stayed in bed
how is your cold?
what cold? and after the show we could go out on the town   i've been taking from arthur murray
so i see
they got a great little band at el chico in the village  it's practically around the corner from where you live
sounds good  how do you know where i live?
that was a mistake but i don't regret it
oh i even know who you live with  your sister and brotherin law  i know when you were born  and where  i know all sorts of things about you
how come?
a couple of months ago i looked up your card in the group insurance file
oh
well don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix they may get the wrong idea how you found out  'bye
marry christmas
thank you  i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea?
in the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once  and then you didn't take your hat off
well as a matter of fact i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night 
the first and only time  a big mistake  i'm gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
i don't blame you it was unforgivable
i forgive you
you shouldn't
you couldn't help yourself i mean when you're having a drink with one man you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man you did the only decent thing
don't be too sure just because i wear a uniform  that doesn't make me a girl scout
miss kubelik one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character  and as far as i'm concerned you're tops i mean decencywise  and otherwisewise  cheers
one more?
i shouldn't drink when i'm driving
by the power vested in me i herewith declare this elevator out of order  shall we join the natives?
why not?  they seem friendly enough
otherwise  i trust you know the difference  you're an intelligent woman finished at nyu
don't you believe it later on there will be human sacrifices  white collar workers tossed into the computing machines and punched full of those little square holes
how many of those drinks did you have?
three
you all right? what's the matter?
nothing  there are just too many people here
guess i made a booboo huh?
no  i like it
really? you mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side   is that better?
dela kiss my big black ass
much better
well as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me  how about the three of us going out this evening  you and me and the bowler  stroll down fifth avenue  sort of break it in 
this is a bad day for me
i understand christmas  family and all that 
i'd better get back to my elevator i don't want to be fired
oh you don't have to worry about that i have quite a bit of influence in personnel you know mr sheldrake?
why?
i thought maybe i could put in a word for you with mr sheldrake  get you a little promotion  how would you like to be an elevator starter?
i'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me
no problem why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays  i could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling    you sure this is the right way to wear it?
don't make me have to use this
i think so
here
what is it?
the mirror  it's broken
your phone
oh  yes?  just a minute  if you don't mind  this is sort of personal
don't you remember? we were at the office party together 
oh yes  office party  miss olsen 
that's right  i told you we had a fight  that's what it was about  miss olsen  you know that other girl you saw 
i don't understand 
okay til tonight
i told you but you wouldn't listen you never listened to me
it's not important fran  the main thing is that i got here in time  and you're going to be all right    isn't she doc?
i'm sorry mr baxter
miss kubelik    you shouldn't be out of bed
i didn't know  i had no idea this was your apartment 
i'm so ashamed why didn't you just let me die?
what kind of talk is that?  so you got a little over emotional  but you're fine now
my head  it feels like a big wad of chewing gum what time is it?
two o'clock
you're in no condition to go anywhere  except back to bed
you don't want me here 
yes your name?
miss kubelik i'm stronger than you are 
i just want to go brush my teeth 
here how about some breakfast?
no  i don't want anything
who are you calling miss kubelik?
my sister  she'll want to know what happened to me
wait a minute  let's talk this over first  just what are you going to tell her?
well i haven't figured it out exactly
you better figure it out  exactly suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
i'll tell her i spent the night with a friend
he i'm mona
who?
someone from the office
and where are you now?
in his apartment
his apartment?
i mean  her apartment
what's your friend's name?
baxter
what's her first name?
when are you coming home?
hi mona
as soon as i can walk
something wrong with your legs?
no  it's my stomach
your stomach?
they had to pump it out
but they'll be worried about me  my brotherinlaw may be calling the police 
that's why we have to be careful  we don't want to involve anybody  after all mr sheldrake is a married man 
i didn't mean it that way  i was just talking to him on the phone  he's very concerned about you
he doesn't give a damn about me
oh you're wrong he told me 
i perfectly understand where you're coming from  as a minority i can relate to your struggle also  but i think you should give us all a chance  we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
she doesn't seem to like you very much
oh i don't mind as a matter of fact i'm sort of flattered  that anybody should think a girl like you  would do a thing like this  over a guy like me
oh did you find something here  an envelope  ?
yes i've got it  don't you think we'd better destroy it? so it won't fall into the wrong hands  ?
there's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill
that's right will you see that mr sheldrake gets it?
you want me to move the television set in here?  you play gin rummy?
i'm not very good at it
i am let me get the cards
i think i'm going to give it all up
this thing was rigged the deck was stacked the fix was in  could don king be near?  good thing sloan had my back  she's my rock  this was going to be a whole lot of work
give what up?
why do people have to love people anyway?
yeah  i know what you mean  queen
i don't want it
what do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
a bad insurance risk?
that's me with men i've been jinxed from the word go  first time i was ever kissed was in a cemetery
a cemetery?
i was fifteen  we used to go there to smoke his name was george  he threw me over for a drum majorette
i just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time bud  how many guys were there?
david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas?  everybody just talk out loud
three the last one was manager of a finance company back home in pittsburgh  they found a little shortage in his accounts but he asked me to wait for him  he'll be out in 1965
cut
so i came to new york and moved in with my sister and her husband  he drives a cab they sent me to secretarial school and i applied for a job with consolidated  but i flunked the typing test 
too slow?
oh i can type up a storm but i can't spell so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator  that's how i met jeff   oh god i'm so fouled up what am i going to do now?
you better win a hand  you're on a blitz
was he really upset when you told him?
mr sheldrake? oh yes very
maybe he does love me  only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife
i'm sure that's the explanation
i'm happy for all of us  it's just we have a great responsibility now the pressure is on
you really think so?
no doubt about it
can i have that pad and the pencil?
what for?
i'm going to write a letter to mrs sheldrake
you are?
as one woman to another  i'm sure she'll understand 
why not?
well for one thing you can't spell and secondly  if you did something like that  you'd hate yourself
i don't like myself very much anyway
pressure?  dela you don't know what the hell real pressure is sheeett  this is lightstuff now when you scramblin' out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
pick up your cards and let's go
do i have to?
you sure you want to throw that card?
sure
who was that?
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne like some?
now don't go getting any ideas miss kubelik
i just want some fresh air
it's only one story down  the best you can do is break a leg
so they'll shoot me  like a horse
that's the way it came out  let me ask you one question  have you ever been in want in need your entire privileged life?
please miss kubelik you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish
who'd care?
i would
why can't i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
there's a call for you 
for me?
 mr sheldrake
i don't want to talk to him
are you all right?
sure  what's that funny smell?
tonight
now i'm privileged?  why?  because i didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  because i didn't call home a cardboard box?  no i never ever went to bed hungry and i'm proud of it too  whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
gas  didn't you turn it on?
yes i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress
you turned it on  but you didn't light it
are you supposed to?
in this house you're supposed to
what are you doing with that?
i was washing my stockings so i decided i might as well do your socks
thank you
it's very curious  i could only find three and a half pair
tennis racquet? oh i remember  i was cooking myself an italian dinner  i used it to strain the spaghetti fran  why not?
can i kiss you too?
as a matter of fact i'm a pretty good cook  but i'm a lousy housekeeper
yes you are  when i was straightening up the couch you know what i found? six hairpins a lipstick a pair of false eyelashes and a swizzle stick from the stork club
it's just that i'm the kind of guy who can't say no  i don't mean to girls  i mean 
you mean to someone like mr sheldrake
i guess so
i know so he's a taker
a what?
some people take some people get took  and they know they're getting took  and there's nothing they can do about it
i wouldn't say that   what would you like to have for diner? there's onion soup and canned asparagus 
you can't leave yet the doctor says it takes fortyeight hours to get the stuff out of your system
naw  i'll take the zero
i know how you feel miss kubelik you think it's the end of the world  but it's not really i went through exactly the same thing myself
you did?
well maybe not exactly  i tried to do it with a gun
over a girl?
worse than that  she was the wife of my best friend  and i was mad for her but i knew it was hopeless  so i decided to end it all i went to a pawnshop and bought a fortyfive automatic and drove up to eden park  do you know cincinnati?
no i don't
anyway i parked the car and loaded the gun  well you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves but believe me it's not that easy  i mean how do you do it?  here or here or here    you know where i finally shot myself?
where?
here
in the knee?
you feel good not nervous?
uhhuh while i was sitting there trying to make my mind up a cop stuck his head in the car because i was illegally parked  so i started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off  pow
that's terrible
yeah took me a year before i could bend my knee  but i got over the girl in three weeks she still lives in cincinnati has four kids gained twenty pounds  she sends me a fruit cake every christmas
are you just making that up to make me feel better?
no thanks the fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how i found out
so let 'em look i'm going to cook dinner for us we'll have the fruit cake for dessert you just sit there and rest you've done enough for one day
are we dressing for dinner?
no  just come as you are
say you're pretty good with that racquet
shall i light the candles?
i feel fine
i see you bought some napkins
you know i used to live like robinson crusoe  shipwrecked among eight million people then one day i saw a footprint in the sand  and there you were   it's a wonderful thing  dinner for two
you usually eat alone?
oh no sometimes i have dinner with ed sullivan sometimes with dinah shore or perry como  the other night i had dinner with mae west  of course she was much younger then  cheers
you know what we're going to do after dinner?
the dishes?
i mean after that?
what?
you don't have to if you don't want to 
i don't?
not nervous?  relaxed?
we're going to finish that gin game
oh
oh miss kubelik how do you feel?
fine how's your eye?
how's everything at the apartment?
nothing's changed you know we never finished that gin game 
i know  i suppose you heard about mr sheldrake ?
you mean leaving his wife? yeah i'm very happy for you
i never thought he'd do it
i told you all along you see you were wrong about mr sheldrake
so they can be on tv
i guess so
for that matter you were wrong about me too what you said about those who take and those who get took? well mr sheldrake wasn't using me  i was using him see?  last month i was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor  now i'm on the twentyseventh floor paneled office three windows  so it all worked out fine  we're both getting what we want
yes  you walking to the subway?
oh
aren't you meeting mr sheldrake?
no you know how people talk so i decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled divorcewise
that's very wise
good night mr baxter
are you all right?
i'm fine
you sound like the media
are you sure? how's your knee?
i'm fine all over
mind if i come in?
where are you going? bud who knows? another neighborhood  another town  another job  i'm on my own
that's funny  so am i  what did you do with the cards?
what about mr sheldrake?
i love you miss kubelik
did you hear what i said miss kubelik? i absolutely adore you
good evening mr baxter
good evening mrs lieberman
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
some weather we're having  must be from all the meshugass at cape canaveral  you locked out of your apartment?
no no  just waiting for a friend good night mrs lieberman
oh  mrs lieberman
so who did you think it was  kris kringle? what was going on here last night?
last night?
all that marching  tramp tramp tramp  you were having army maneuvers maybe?
i'm sorry mrs lieberman  and i'll never invite those people again
what you get from renting to bachelors all night i didn't sleep ten minutes  and i'm sure you woke up dr dreyfuss
don't worry about dr dreyfuss  i happen to know he was out on a case
oh mr baxter  i'm glad you're here  i was just going to get the passkey
same thing giuliani said
what for?
i thought i smelled gas coming from your apartment
baxter?
yes sir
i was sort of wondering what you looked like sit down
been hearing some very nice things about you  here's a report from mr dobisch  loyal cooperative resourceful 
mr dobisch said that?
and mr kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office  without overtime
well you know how it is  things pile up
mr vanderhof in public relations and mr eichelberger in mortgage and loan  they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments
you promise?
no joke  serious
tell me baxter  just what is it that makes you so popular?
i don't know
would you mind repeating the question?
look baxter i'm not stupid i know everything that goes on in this building  in every department  on every floor  every day of the year
you do?
in 1957 we had an employee here name of fowler he was very popular too turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the actuarial department tying up the switchboard figuring the odds on our ibm machines  so the day before the kentucky derby i called in the vice squad and we raided the thirteenth floor
the vice squad?
that's right baxter
what  what's that got to do with me? i'm not running any bookie joint
what kind of joint are you running?
hope the same thing doesn't happen to me  that's some big shoes to fill
sir?
there's a certain key floating around the office  from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch  it's the key to a certain apartment  and you know who that apartment belongs to?
who?
loyal cooperative resourceful c c baxter
oh
are you going to deny it?
no sir i'm not going to deny it but if you'd just let me explain 
you better
baxter an insurance company is founded on public trust any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming   how many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
just those four  out of a total of 31259  so actually we can be very proud of our personnel  percentagewise
what are you?  a man or a mouse? are you a punk?  punking out on me?
that's not the point four rotten apples in a barrel  no matter how large the barrel  you realize that if this ever leaked out 
where is your apartment?
west 67th street you have no idea what i've been going through  with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key 
how do you work it with the key?
where are you going baxter?
well i don't want to intrude  and i thought  since it's all straightened out anyway 
i'm not through with you yet
yes sir
the reason i called is  i won't be home for dinner tonight the branch manager from kansas city is in town  i'm taking him to the theatre music man what else? no don't wait up for me  'bye darling  tell me something  baxter   have you seen music man?
not yet but i hear it's one swell show
no
how would you like to go tonight?
you mean  you and me? i thought you were taking the branch manager from kansas city 
i made other plans you can have both tickets
well that's very kind of you  only i'm not feeling well  you see i have this cold  and i thought i'd go straight home
baxter you're not reading me i told you i have plans
so do i  i'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed  so you better give the tickets to somebody else 
i'm not just giving those tickets baxter  i want to swap them
it also says here  that you are alert astute and quite imaginative 
this?
that's good thinking baxter next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here  and as far as i'm concerned you're executive material
you getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
i am?
oh  terribly sorry it's that cold 
relax baxter
now remember baxter  this is going to be our little secret
yes of course
you know how people talk
oh you don't have to worry 
not that i have anything to hide
oh no sir certainly not anyway it's none of my business  four apples five apples  what's the difference  percentagewise?
here you are baxter have a nice time
you've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost  don't you know you should never let them see you sweat  y'knowwhati'msayin'?
morning gentlemen  everything satisfactory? you like your office?
oh yes sir very much and i want to thank you 
i like the way you handled that well how does it feel to be an executive?
fine and i want you to know i'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me  sheldrake sure you will  say baxter about the apartment  now that you got a raise don't you think we can afford a second key?
well  i guess so
you know my secretary  miss olsen 
oh yes very attractive is she  the lucky one?
no you don't understand she's a busybody  always poking her nose into things  and with that key passing back and forth  why take chances?
to me?
i mean  the young lady  whoever she may be  it was on the couch when i got home last night
yeah
oh yes thanks
the mirror is broken  it was broken when i found it
so it was  she threw it at me
sir?
you know how it is  sooner or later they all give you a bad time
i know how it is
you see a girl a couple of times a week  just for laughs  and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife i ask you  is that fair?
no sir that's very unfair  especially to your wife
yeah  you know baxter i envy you bachelor  all the dames you want  no headaches no complications 
yes sir that's the life all right
you shouldn't even be mad at me over sloan
put me down for thursday again
hello?  yes  what's on your mind baxter?
i hate to disturb you but something came up  it's rather important  and i think it would be a good idea if you could see me  at the apartment  as soon as possible
you're not making sense baxter what's this all about?
i didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party  you know who i mean  i found her here last night  she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills
i thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up
that's impossible  you'll have to handle this situation yourself  as a matter of fact i'm counting on you 
yes she's in the shower  she's coming along fine considering
good is there anything you need  money  ?
no thank you mr sheldrake as a matter of fact i've got some money for you  a hundred dollars 
what you did is dead wrong
oh  well if there's anything i can do for you 
for me? i don't think so but i was hoping maybe you could do something for her 
mr sheldrake i've got good news for you 
and i've got good news for you baxter all your troubles are over
sir?
i know how worried you were about miss kubelik  well stop worrying  i'm going to take her off your hands
you're going to take her off my hands?
that's right  i've moved out of my house  i'm going to be staying in town at the athletic club
you left your wife?
well if you must know  i fired my secretary my secretary got to my wife and my wife fired me ain't that a kick in the head?
oh is it?  buddy boy in this business if people don't produce they get fired
yeah 
now what was your news baxter?
it's about miss kubelik  she's all right again  so she went back home
you like?  it's all yours
mine?
my assistant roy thompson has been shifted to the denver office and you're taking his place  what's the matter baxter? you don't seem very excited
well it's just that so many things have been happening so fast  i'm very pleased  especially for miss kubelik now that i've gotten to know her better i think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody 
oh sure sure but first the property settlement has to be worked out  then it takes six weeks in reno  meanwhile i'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while  oh by the way you can now have lunch in the executive dining room 
that's just one of the privileges that goes with this job you also get a nice little expense account the use of the executive washroom   say what happened to you baxter?
i got kicked in the head too
yeah  i promise
sloan is the hardest working person i've ever met
here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover thirtyseven percent of our female employees leave to get married twentytwo percent quit because 
you're working too hard baxter it's new year's eve  relax
yes sir
i suppose you'll be on the town tonight  celebrating?
naturally
me too i'm taking miss kubelik out  i finally talked her into it 
i see
the only thing is i'm staying at the athletic club  and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind 
don't mind what?
you know that other key to your apartment  well when we had that little scare about miss kubelik i thought i'd better get rid of it quick  so i threw it out the window of the commuter train
let me ask you a question if i may how do you think she got the job in the first place?  i don't mean to burst your bubble mantan the marvelous but sloan is an opportunity
very clever
now i'll have to borrow your key
sorry mr sheldrake
what do you mean sorry?
you're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment
i'm not just bringing anybody  i'm bringing miss kubelik
especially not miss kubelik
how's that again?
no key
baxter i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man you realize what you're doing? not to me  but to yourself normally it takes years to work your way up to the twentyseventh floor  but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again you dig?
i don't believe it
i dig
now you're being bright?
say baxter  you gave me the wrong key
no i didn't
but this is the key to the executive washroom
what's gotten into you baxter?
just following doctor's orders i've decided to become a mensch you know what that means? a human being
now hold on baxter 
baxter?
how do you do mr matuschka?
mantan we got a show to tape
okay get your clothes on i got the cab downstairs
now wait a minute i know what you're thinking  but it's not as bad as it looks  matuschka  it's none of my business what you do fran  you're over twenty one  but your sister happens to think you're a lady
all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes 
what's the matter with miss kubelik?
oh this is mr matuschka  he's miss kubelik's  he's got a cab downstairs 
no no  just had a little accident
on account of me
you?
mr kirkeby i don't like to complain  but you were supposed to be out of here by eight
i know buddyboy i know  but those things don't always run on schedule  like a greyhound bus
my name is manray goddamnit
i don't mind in the summer  but on a rainy night  and i haven't had any dinner yet 
sure sure  look kid  i put in a good word for you with sheldrake in personnel
mr sheldrake?
that's right  we were discussing our department  manpowerwise  and promotionwise    and i told him what a bright boy you were  they're always on the lookout for young executives bud thank you mr kirkeby
you're on your way up buddyboy and you're practically out of liquor
i know  mr eichelberger  in the mortgage loan department  last night he had a little halloween party here 
well lay in some vodka and some vermouth  and put my name on it
yes mr kirkeby  you still owe me for the last two bottles 
good morning mr kirkeby
oh how are you baxter  they keeping you busy these days?
you must think i'm some kind of fool
that kubelik  boy  would i like to get her on a slow elevator to china
oh yes  she's the best operator in the building
i'm a pretty good operator myself  but she just won't give me a tumble  datewise
maybe you're using the wrong approach
a lot of guys around here have tried it  all kinds of approaches  no dice  what is she trying to prove?
could be she's just a nice respectable girl  there are millions of them
hello? yeah baxter what's up?
instead of friday  could you possibly switch to thursday? you'd be doing me a great favor 
baxter we're a little disappointed in you  gratitudewise
so long baxter we know you won't let us down
it looks delicious
hi baxter
what do you want?
you can't come in
look you can't stay here just take your champagne and go
baxter i don't want to pull rank on you  but i told the lady it was all set  you want to make a liar out of me?
buddyboy why didn't you say so?  you got yourself a little playmate huh?
say why don't we have ourselves a party  the four of us?
hiya buddyboy  i'm in this bar on sixtyfirst street  and i got to thinking about you  and i figured i'd give you a little buzz
well that's very nice of you  but who is this?
dobisch  joe dobisch in administration
you hear me talkin' to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
oh yes mr dobisch  i didn't recognize your voice 
that's okay buddyboy  now like i was saying i'm in this joint on sixtyfirst  and i think i got lucky    she's a skater with the ice show    and i thought maybe i could bring her up for a quiet drink
i'm sorry mr dobisch  you know i like to help you guys out  but it's sort of late  so why don't we make it some other time?
buddyboy  she won't keep that long  not even on ice  listen kid i can't pass this up  she looks like marilyn monroe
i don't care if it is marilyn monroe  i'm already in bed  and i've taken a sleeping pill  so i'm afraid the answer is no
look baxter  we're making out the monthly efficiency rating  and i'm putting you in the top ten now you don't want to louse yourself up do you?
of course not  but  how can i be efficient in the office if i don't get enough sleep at night?
make it thirty minutes  what do you say bud?
i'm all out of liquor  and there's no clean glasses  no cheese crackers  no nothing
let me worry about that  just leave the key under the mat and clear out
c'mon mommy don't start with that i'm an ungrateful son stuff
oh buddyboy i was just about to call you  i'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall you see my little friend she kept insisting picasso was a bum  so she started to do that mural  but i'm sure it will wash off  just eyebrow pencil
it's not picasso i'm calling about it's the key  to my apartment  you were supposed to leave it under the mat
i did didn't i? i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there 
oh i found a key there all right  only it's the wrong key
it is?  well how about that? no wonder i couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning
and i couldn't get into my apartment  so at four a m i had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut
that's a shame i'll send the key right down and about your promotion    i'm sending that efficiency report right up to mr sheldrake in personnel i wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over
teamwork  that's what counts in an organization like this all for one and one for all  know what i mean?
we went to bat for you  and now you won't play ball with us
i sympathize with your problem  and believe me i'm very sorry 
how's the food?
you'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you
you threatening me?
dear mr macintosh   vanderhof public relations oh yes baxter just a minute  all right miss finch  type up what we got so far  now what is it baxter?
look mr vanderhof  i've got you down here for tonight  but i'm going to be using the place myself  so i'll have to cancel
cancel? but it's her birthday  i already ordered the cake 
i hate to disappoint you  i mean many happy returns  but not tonight 
that's not like you baxter just the other day at the staff meeting i was telling mr sheldrake what a reliable man you were
thank you mr vanderhof but i'm sick  i have this terrible cold  and a fever  and i got to go to bed right after work
buddyboy that's the worst thing you can do if you got a cold you should go to a turkish bath  spend the night there  sweat it out 
oh no i'd get pneumonia  and if i got pneumonia i'd be in bed for a month  and if i were in bed for a month 
okay  and you know what i'll swing by my place grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yourshow's that would that be a good thing
can't beat it with a hammer  well since you asked it looks like i may have a new show a pilot being shot
okay you made your point we'll just have to do it next wednesday  that's the only night of the week i can get away
quite an office  name on the door  rug on the floor  the whole schmear
good evening baxter
hi doc  had a late call?
yeah  some clown at schrafft's 57th street ate a club sandwich and forgot to take out the toothpick
oh  'bye doc
say baxter  the way you're belting that stuff you must have a pair of castiron kidneys
oh that's not me  it's just that once in a while i have some people in for a drink
as a matter of fact you must be an iron man all around from what i hear through the walls you got something going for you every night
i'm sorry if it gets noisy 
it was  it is  but this is a different kind of show
sometimes  there's a twinight doubleheader  a nebbish like you
you know baxter  i'm doing some research at the columbia medical center  and i wonder if you could do us a favor?
me?
when you make out your will  and the way you're going you should  would you mind leaving your body to the university?

any of that coffee left?
mommy please don't call me that
how do you spell her last name?
kubelik  with two k's
why do you want to know doc? you don't have to report this do you?
it's regulations
she didn't mean it doc  it was an accident  she had a little too much to drink and  she didn't know what she was doing  there was no suicide note or anything  believe me doc i'm not thinking about myself 
aren't you?
it's just that she's got a family  and there's the people in the office  look doc can't you forget you're a doctor  let's just say you're here as a neighbor 
help yourself
i don't know what you did to that girl in there  and don't tell me  but it was bound to happen the way you carry on live now pay later diner's club  why don't you grow up baxter? be a mensch you know what that means?

 same sauce  sweet and sour
you don't know what it's like  standing next to you in that elevator day after day  good morning miss kubelik  good night mr sheldrake  i'm still crazy about you fran
let's not start on that again jeff  please i'm just beginning to get over it
i don't believe you
look jeff  we had two wonderful months this summer  and that was it happens all the time  the wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist  or the elevator girl comes september the picnic is over  goodbye the kids go back to school the boss goes back to the wife and the girl   they don't make these shrimp like they used to
i never said goodbye fran
how do you think i felt  riding home on that sevenfourteen train?
why do you keep calling me jeff? what do you want from me?
he's performing at some place outside of richmond virginia
i want you back fran
sorry mr sheldrake  i'm full up you'll have to take the next elevator
you're not giving me a chance fran i asked you to meet me because  i have something to tell you fran go ahead  tell me
not here fran can't we go some place else?
no i have a date at eightthirty
important?
fran  remember that last weekend we had?
do i that leaky little boat you rented  and me in a black negligee and a life preserver 
remember what we talked about?
we talked about a lot of things
richmond is not all the way down south
i mean  about my getting a divorce
we didn't talk about it  you did
you didn't really believe me did you?
they got it an a long playing record now  music to string her along by my wife doesn't understand me  we haven't gotten along for years  you're the best thing that ever happened to me 
that's enough fran
just trust me baby  we'll work it out somehow 
you're not being funny
i wasn't trying
if you'll just listen to me for a minute 
okay i'm sorry
i don't even know why you're still concerned over him  daddy's not with you
i saw my lawyer this morning  i wanted his advice   about the best way to handle it 
handle what?
what do you think?
let's get something straight jeff  i never asked you to leave your wife
of course not you had nothing to do with it
are you sure that's what you want?
i'm sure if you'll just tell me that you still love me 
you know i do
i have that date  remember?
where are we going jeff? not back to that leaky boat 
regardless he still is your father
come on fran  don't be like that you just going to sit there and keep bawling?  you won't talk to me you won't tell me what's wrong   look i know you think i'm stalling you but when you've been married to a woman for twelve years you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "pass the sugar  and i want a divorce" it's not that easy  anyway this is the wrong time the kids are home from school  my in laws are visiting for the holidays  i can't bring it up now  this isn't like you fran  you were always such a good sport  such fun to be with 
yeah  that's me the happy idiot  a million laughs
well that's more like it at least you're speaking to me
funny thing happened to me at the office party today  i ran into your secretary  miss olsen you know  ringadingding? i laughed so much i like to died
is that what's been bothering you  miss olsen? that's ancient history
i was never very good at history let me see  there was miss olsen and then there was miss rossi  no she came before  it was miss koch who came after miss olsen 
now fran 
and just think  right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me 
how could i be so stupid? you'd think i would have learned by now  when you're in love with a married man you shouldn't wear mascara
it's christmas eve fran  let's not fight
it's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
oh our friend from the chinese restaurant thanks fran we better keep it here
yeah we better
okay  i just thought as long as it was paid for 
don't ever talk like that fran don't make yourself out to be cheap
a hundred dollars? i wouldn't call that cheap and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment 
stop that fran
coming?
you run along  i want to fix my face
don't forget to kill the lights see you monday
sure monday and thursday  and monday again  and thursday again 
okay
even more reason to see him  he'll be overjoyed with your success
hello jeff  yes i'm all right
are you there fran?
of course i'm not here  because the whole thing never happened  i never took those pills  i never loved you  we never even met  isn't that the way you want it?
sorry it took me so long on the phone but we're all set
all set for what?
i rented a car  it's going to be here at one o'clock  we're driving to atlantic city
atlantic city?
i know it's a drag  but you can't find a hotel room in town  not on new year's eve
ring out the old year ring in the new ringadingding
i didn't plan it this way fran  actually it's all baxter's fault
c'mon mommy  daddy hasn't been impressed with anything i've ever done  from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present
baxter?
he wouldn't give me the key to the apartment

just walked out on me  quit  threw that big fat job right in my face
the nerve
that little punk  after all i did for him he said i couldn't bring anybody to his apartment  especially not miss kubelik what's he got against you anyway?

i'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can
hey dad  why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?

that's not
thank you
well before there was black or african american there were negroes  i'm a negro
signs?
listen
what is it?
will they attack?
two hours after the fog lifted we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below kurtz's camp we approached a long sandbank stretching down the middle of the river
which way? right or left?
who knows? right
anybody see some smoke ?
what cat  ?
one that went up for murder  he was an army sergeant

if you're bl willard 4th recon group we'd like you to come with us
i only met kurtz once
would he remember you ?
you didn't like him
my visual style is very erotic sexy how do you say  hot?
what does that mean ?
our recon flight ?
ours
touchy
you can see of course the implications if any of this  even rumours leaked out
you want me to clean it up  simple and quiet
exactly  you'll go up the nung river in a navy pbr  appear at nu mung ba as if by accident reestablish your acquintance with colonel kurtz find out what's happened  and why then terminate his command

yeah
colonel kurtz he's dead
captain bl willard g4 headquarters reporting as ordered sir
no sir
this gentleman or myself ?
no sir
i believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in kontum is that right ?
you know much about about special forces; green berets captain ?
yeah
i thought he was a lame
good luck jukka  do a good show
a lame ?
this is years ago before he joined special forces i guess we had an argument
about what ?
i don't know he was a lame that's all
but why ?
he couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill
well he's killing now
fifty calibers eh captain 
as i said we can pay you in gold
american weapons?
i know all of you have seen the overnight ratings  through the roof  but in this game you gotta be one two three steps ahead  i introduce you to myrna goldfarb she's the best media consultant in the biz
we don't want to bother you any we 
a habit of men of war sir  you understand
it is very good  there is no current  it is very good i have never seen one like it in all indochina i was in paris when it arrived  do you know what might have caused 
looks like a two thousand pound to me yeah a two thousand pound bomb
attacks repulsed as i was saying  this is only  for this war captain viet cong  54; north vietnamese regular forces  15; south vietnamese  28  regular forces and otherwise  americain  6 of course they were perhaps mistakes captain
of course i  once we make our repairs we could send word we could have you evacuated from here
captain?
you'll get blown outta here some day
we will never 'evacuate' captain  this is our home indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twentyone years there is something to say for that
the vietnamese think it's theirs  i guess the americans do too
myrna is here to help us plan our strategy
but we civilized it a place belongs to those who bring light to it don't you agree
upriver? why upriver? there is nothing there only jungle
do you know that jungle?
when i was a boy my father would take me there to hunt there are a few savages but no man can live there no white man
two of my men deserted last night it happens from time to time i assume my daughter told you of our conditions
i guess this is what men of war do  eh?
what's your name sailor ?
gunner's mate third class  l johnson sir
lance johnson? the surfer?
it's an honor to meet you lance i've admired your noseriding for years  i like your cutback too i think you have the best cutback there is

nu mung ba last i heard walter kurtz commanded a green beret detachment at nu mung ba
when did you hear?
you've never had any formal training either?
'bout a year ago? is kurtz still alive?
who knows
seems to me he got himself fragged i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent maybe a rumor helluva man  remarkable officer walter kurtz woulda been a general some day general of the army shit head of the joint chiefs of staff did you knew kurtz?
i met him
don't you agree?
he musta changed   i got to get into the nung river here or here
that village you're pointing at is kinda hairy
hairy ?
i mean it's hairy  they got some pretty heavy ordnance boy  i've lost a few recon ships in there now and again
so? i heard you had a good bunch of killers here
not a class not a thing just picked stuff up by myself
and i don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman nung river you say you don't know kurtz?
i met him
you talk like him i don't mind taking casualties captain but i like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit  ten cong to one
you'll find enough cong up there
we'll come in low out of the rising sun  we'll put on the music about a mile out
music?
fucking savages

i'm kurtz
why did you come to  my province
we were attacked  down river we need supplies and medical help

no  no sir
you came up my river  in that small boat so simple i always thought the final justice would come from the sky like we did  you are the final justice aren't you?
you sing and dance?
what do you mean colonel?
what other reason could you have come? a captain ranger paratrooper graduate of the recondo school am i right about these things?
do you know me?
yeah i can see that he's fuckin nuts 
i said get the fuck out   i'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow  he's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic he knows how to use a hypodermic

you can't have water after morphine
still playing by the rules  you're a damn good kiler
how's the pain?

i can handle it
pain is easy to handle  but nobility the nobility of a man is judged by how much truth he can handle
what truth?
gimme water
no water
how did we get here?
so what's up with you and dela?
because of all the things we do the thing we do best  is lie
i think think a lie stinks
oh captain that is so true
you could never figure it because it doesn't make sense
fuck no
i'll tell you what makes sense  air strikes  white phosphorus  napalm  we'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want
go away  hide yourself
what are you doing?
going back   to the jungle to die
i'm taking you back you can still live
what do you mean?
i had immense plans
i'm gonna get you out of here
my river my people my jungle my ideas my country my wife   my death

he was a remarkable man it was impossible not to 
love him yes it is true that's the hard part for me i knew him better than anyone  i knew him best
no we're not knocking boots  i got this internship while i still was at nyu dela was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant
you knew him best
you were his friend you must have been if he had given you this  if he sent you to his home he was the best this country had  he was 
yes i know
i'll never get over it  but i'll always remember him
both of us
men looked up to him  he died as he lived
his death was  yes he died as he lived
were you with him when
maybe he'll get tubed

sooner or later that's everybody
i'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with  you look beautiful like that
what's that?
he'll kill us
are you finished surfing?
yeah thanks
want to say goodbye to the colonel?
nah
no  no captain
which one's the colonel's?

maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark  we got his yater
if that was suppose to be a compliment i thank you
you hear it again?
no  i don't think so but it'll be back they were circling it'll be back
you think he'd of shot us?
when?
i don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but  he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board 
a yater spoon is hard to get  especially here
captain  that was all true about the rats and chocolate and stuff?
sure
and you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
what's this tiger shit?
you're welcome  you shouldn't give up on performing

this boat's a mess
where's kurtz? i want to talk to him
oh you don't talk to colonel kurtz  you listen to him god these are good i kept these people off you you know it wasn't easy
why did they attack us?
simple they don't want him to go
you're australian?
preaustralian actually but i'd dig goin' to california i'm california dreamin'
so kurtz is alive
i think that would probably make you the happiest  when i'm hoofing i mean really doing my thing hitting it nothing compares to that feeling in the world
but lemme tell you he is the most dangerous thing in every way that i've come on so far he wanted to shoot me the first thing he said is 'i'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter' i said i didn't desert from your army i deserted from my army he said 'i'm going to shoot you just the same'
why didn't he shoot you?
sounds like he's gone crazy
no colonel kurtz couldn't be crazy  if you heard him talk just last week you'd never think he was crazy

27   continued:
a certain sonofabitch bastard more
39   continued:
is it inevitable that the game plays you?
how long have you been up north?
six months
my dad was a navy doctor
knew you had no native blood even with your dark hair  blue eyes give you away  my wife had blue eyes
had?
she's dead
oh
had some good years  met her in '66  she showed up one day in coldfoot  no one knew her  one sunday morning she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder  didn't work out in three months she'd return the money and leave no hard feelings  my bid was eight thousand dollars  beautiful girl
how did she?
what about you  why come back? classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things
no if you go with the flow tavis that's what a lot of negroes don't understand  protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing  if people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it  or better yet write your own show  do it better
you should know something
i don't want to talk any more
have you talked to eric?
i have not but i very much want to  what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron?
 get this straight: i'm the district supervisor  whatever you do reflects on me  it wasn't my idea to bring you people up here but i'm stuck with you you are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes whichever side you take you alienate the other  mr corbett is quite wellknown in this region  people admire him 
what happened here?
the radio's on the fritz
where'd you say eric is?
somewhere along the pipeline
what about that hotheaded marshal sam wilder?  i heard he was in the middle of this mess
don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
sam?  we haven't seen him
really  i thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside  by the way  your truck also 'on the fritz?'
why?
he's coming around fine
what are you doing?
stay here
great idea  pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a highpowered hunting rifle
thanks
i call it 'the turtle' as in carrying your home on your back
best thing is meyerling has to chase around to find us
i don't know what a retort is but it's simple  mantan  the new millennium minstrel show is universal  it's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem  this is america  our ancestors helped build this country we got a right just like everybody else  i'm not gonna box myself in this show makes people think and they're laughing at the same time
i'll go into town with you
eric leave it alone  it's not your business
did you catch corbett?
sure did  he was one of the trappers we rousted from the haul road
was there any trouble?
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker
going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers eric
oh sweetheart  it's beautiful
you were looking at it in the catalog  don't know where you can wear it
i'll wear it for you  and i can wear it when we go home  we won't be here forever
this is my best friend sleep 'n eat
you make it sound like a prison sentence
that's not what i meant
it's exactly what you meant
look why get into this again as long as it's working let's leave it alone  it's been nice so far  we're together 
 permanently?
i still can't believe i'm being financed by an oil company especially when they get a look at these pictures  technology in the wilderness; not too pretty  what's that?
winter  two straight months of night  we may never get out of bed  which would suit me fine
prolonged darkness makes people crazy
hightech in the wilderness gets me excited too
let's go
we both left the hustle and bustle of uptown harlem
maybe you should drive him into devil's cauldron let them decide what to do with him
be careful okay?
oh christ sweetheart  four days  i thought you were dead or worse
you can't stay here  go back to the turtle  i'll meet you back there in a few hours
what's going on?
i'll tell you everything later
where's corbett?
here  a transport plane is due at eleven  once i put him on it it's all over
please anne marie you being here only complicates things
you're hurt
the big apple new york new york
technology in the wilderness only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip
when you ran off i thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in washington
leave it here
let's keep going  we're only an hour from devil's cauldron
had no choice  given the situation
go ahead  take the jeep  i'll come to cache with bob when he gets here
okay by me  you're the one likes these hot springs so much
you got two counts against you  trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land
can't be much of a crime if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid
ben corbett?
to come back to our roots
yep  afraid you have me at a disadvantage
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these  didn't expect we'd already met
desmond
new to the country kid?
six months  ecological study for northland oil
nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window  see you again maybe
a lot to ask dragging him away from such a goodlooking girl 
does he have people?
a daughter in oregon
surviving is what i know 
i think you're getting a little moody there eddie
our alabamy home  now we're getting countrified  we is bama's
how the hell were they smart enough to find us?
been driving long?
i needed a pilot's license to take the job here so i got one in six weeks
sounds like professional jealousy
stay put
next time you want to kill yourself don't include me
i took the odds on getting down in one piece and i made it  now we're in my territory
with light clothing and no supplies this is nobody's territory
i'm not gonna carry you out of here
that's right  you're not
no mo' "city slickers"  ahh can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
we'll stop here dig out a snow shelter
still quite a hike to devil's cauldron  days  a long stretch to go without sleep my friend  you can hide behind that pistol for now but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze 
ice is too thin  you can see the water moving underneath
we're not sitting here 'til november  there's a cargo plane coming to devil's cauldron in four days and i'm putting you on it
we get wet we freeze to death in a couple hours
be my guest
most dangerous thing in the world: a regular joe in over his head  you trying to prove how tough you are for me or for yourself?
it wasn't my idea to crash the plane
let's camp  there's grayling under this ice i'll snare some for dinner
tell 'em what you mean mistuh mantan
we've got another two hours of daylight
have to backtrack find another way down
forget it  it would take days
damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains  it continues we better stay put
it could blow over tomorrow too
where in hell meyerling dig you up?
you know meyerling?
sure love to know where you fit in up here
i'm here to do my job
folks come to alaska for a real short list of reasons:  money adventure  solitude  those cover most everyone  but frontiers also draw another type of man  one with a demon in his gut  he comes to the edge of the world to face that demon and lay it to rest
well thank you mistuh sleep 'n eat
yeah?
there's a cabin maybe twenty miles south of here
too bad we're heading west
there's a snowmobile inside a day we could be on the yukon  i got money there  remember that five thousand?  make it ten  be smart  take it and walk away
have to get these wet things off
stay awake  you want to go hypothermic?
told you i'm fine
how many do you see?
what?  fuck off  save yourself
you don't feel cold?
cousins i want all of you to go to your windows  go to your windows and yell  yell i'm tired of the drugs the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents  i'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks i'm tired you're tired we're all tired of these socalled bible thumping god fearing whore mongling professional athletes  aren't you tired of these basketballdunking footballrunning hophip rapping ebonicspeaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different ho's?  i know i am and so is sleep 'n eat
stay still
where's my elt?
emergency transmitter?  all your gear is back at wilder's
you got one?
it was blown up with the plane
i'm hungry  go kill me some dinner
an appetite  maybe you won't die after all
nome?  i figure you'd be a whaler coming from there
told that's what our old man was planned on going to sea me and bob 'til i read jack london started trapping when i was ten mailed the furs to sears  eight bucks for a skunk three for a muskrat  that was fine money
killing wildlife not good enough anymore so you go on to bigger and better things
you tellin' the truth
don't judge me  you're a joke coming here from a fuckedup culture telling us what to do
yeah it is fucked up  but it's not too late to keep that from happening here
what do you know about people? you live like an animal  a savage goddamn throwback like you belongs out here as far away from the rest of us as possible
don't push me
they think you're in fairbanks if not they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow
don't bet on it
i already have
maybemaybe not  i'll tell you what scares me  stumbling through life like an ordinary jerk  that's why i want to work on the front lines where what i do means something  soon as i got here i realized my job was bullshit  oil company propaganda  i was ready to leave then i thought screw it i'll outsmart them do the work anyway  i don't know anymore  maybe i am fooling myself  that's what i'm afraid of most of all
talk to that goodlooking girl of yours?
you broke the radio remember?
y'know my lady lucindy?
you were real resourceful out there  got me thinking of this perimeter man froze all his fingers one winter  so he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones  gets along better than ever  yeah maybe i underestimated you
i liked you better frozen  you didn't talk so much
emergency transmitter?  what happened to signal mirrors or twotone smoke fires?
lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area  only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths elt was in my duffel bag not around my neck where it should've been
maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend
shut up
answer and i'll shoot
snow's to their advantage kid you can't see them but soon as that plane comes they'll sure as hell know where we're going wise up  take me to the yukon i'll give you that money and guarantee you'll walk away
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
can you walk?
the one with da big
wound's a throughandthrough missed my liver i think
how come you didn't let him shoot me?
like i said i'd still be up on that mountain frozen solid it wasn't for you
look down there tell me what any of this matters  struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness soon there won't be a trace of our troubles or us
hullo sam  slow day?
benboys  yeah real slow and i'd like to keep it that way
relax  one more day without drink won't kill you  right sam?
i'm living proof of that sad fact
can we buy the marshal some dinner?
you wouldn't shoot anyone
not her the one with the little
all this for laying traps on private land?
christ if i shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth  i've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old
i got it from here  thanks
sam listen  i shot to defend my man  other guy drew first
if that was all fine  but carving him up stranding the others that's too fucking much is everything that walks crawls flies or swims fair game to you?
i'll get loose before that plane comes
you better get some sleep
goddammit i don't need this aggravation  i'll shoot you ben  bank on it
i don't want to hurt you sam
i'm not too old to knock the snot out of you
oh her
i need to rent a cabin
what's the problem with sam wilder's place?
will you rent me a cabin or not?
pretty clever:  if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time sam's is the first place they'll look  they may figure you're waiting for an airplane so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip  last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town  i can't afford any trouble 
 here's a hundred dollars  and if you or anyone else will back me up on this 
 forget it  and try not to bleed on my throw rugs  why do this?
mr desmond  arthur neff  area rep for the federal assistance plan  tell the boys in dc to keep those goodies coming
sure
you don't mind me saying mr desmond you look like hell
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me anne marie?
how old are your kids?
no not that  how 'bout
not a damn thing  what's going on?  mr meyerling was here all steamed up looking for you
look neff i've got ben corbett with me 
 here?  where's wilder?
if corbett's men find out 
 i'm putting him on the plane to fairbanks eleven tomorrow
jiminy christmas  what do you want from me?
what's wrong?
i was just on my way to your ladyfriend's but i guess she found you
yeah  sorry i barked at you last night
look mr desmond i didn't count on it turning this ugly
she hates dem
what are you talking about?
bastards killed sam you think they won't kill the rest of us?
there'll be three four men at the most  i have some backup nothing will happen
you don't care enough about sam to 
neff you know better than this
alleged killer
what does this matter to you?
you can't see past your lousy little assignment sniffing around the pipeline  the few voters there are in this district look up to corbett and i'm not about to alienate them
i should release corbett because you want some votes?
this miserable wilderness is a state of the union  policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box  that's the beauty of it  these icebox cowboys are living a century too late  get them on your side it's like buying manhattan for beads  with a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the new world
too bad  how 'bout a dress?
nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that correct?  that's good  now eric you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us
fuck you
bet you're right  but i didn't come by to wangle a meal 
what'd you say they call these spaceships?
hey sam look over there  black and white smoke
damn  likely that's an sos have to pass on that lunch
i'm too old for this shit
you give us a ride in the cessna you got hangared at the pumping station we'll be in fairbanks in a few hours
that's what we should've done in the first place
wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
sleep 'n eat one of dem slinky sexy little foxy
why the smirk?
bet i could make some money turning ben corbett in  maybe more for lettin' him loose  i was up in my cache  saw the northland man come talk to you
you're out of your greedy goddamn mind
corbett coming here stinks of trouble  we should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass
he saw you and corbett come in
dead  trappers killed him
lemalle  we got a problem where's mitchell?
there you go  wilder's always chummy with the fuckin' bambilovers
i called the cops in fairbanks see when ben is standing trial they don't know shit about ben or wilder
get the fuck out of here
mantan way too short too tight get her one of dose
it's a threehour flight  they shoulda got there yesterday
go easy
i ain't gonna leave a seven hundreddollar remington behind
what you gonna do with it?  large bore's for shit on small game
thought that door was open last night
look we pull ben's ass out of the fire i'll get you a whole damn crate of snickers bars
you hear me?  ben?
kenai's pa  but how the fuck she seein' us?
ben never sent a signal
meaning he'll need a plane
to big  the inbetween one not too tight not too lose
closest planes for hire are here in cache
naah wilder knows we got friends in town
okay let's backtrack try to pick up his trail  you know the kid out on the pipeline that wilder's buddies with?
it's sam wilder
musta wanted to keep him from the bears  if ben killed him he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this
there's what they're waiting on
this is sam wilder marshal in devil's cauldron  had some killings here  i got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands
on a good day i couldn't spare a crosswalk guard  but now no way  folks're batshit with the weather turning sour  bring him in yourself
next plane's not coming 'til next monday
sit your suspect out in the cold he'll keep
not for me my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for
this man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration
i didn't know you had a secret admire
huh?
there is a seriously goofy man behind this you are not allowed to block out that fact
do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
it lets a crazy man into our lives
you're not still writing that thankyou note?
i'm on the last page how do you spell conscience?
conscience i got sean from the bakery to babysit so let's go out
i still don't feel safe leaving spencer with someone how do you spell it again?
i thought you got rid of
spencer is okay you'd better start finding something else to do with your free time if you can't feel good about this break and step out a little  you ought to get mr udall to send you over a psychiatrist
i don't know it's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time without that you just start thinking about yourself  and what does that ever get anybody today on the bus there was this adorable couple and i felt myself giving them a dirty look  i had no idea everything was
go ahead
 moving in the wrong direction away from when i even remembered what it was like to have a man to anything hold fucking  sorry  hands with for christ's sake i was feeling like really bad that dr bettes is married  which is probably why i make poor spencer hug me more than he wants to like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems he has to make up for his mom not getting any  oh boy who needs these thoughts?
spencer's doing fine so what are you saying that you're frustr
what is it you want? what?
how was it talking to him?
stop treating this like i'm going away with a man he's just going to say those crappy sick complaining angry things to me i hate this mom  i hate this he's a freak show  the worst person i ever met
call me as soon as you're settled
stop it why can't i have a normal boyfriend??? why? get out of here just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me

doc  so listen you gotta let me know about the additional costs  one way or the other we'll
i'm starving
i know he's just the best
i'll buy her a less expensive dress so i can have some money left over to take her out to dinner

the table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it two sausages six bacon strips fries three eggs over easy and coffee
you're gonna die soon with that diet you know that?
clippity clop  clippity clop  she has to pretend she doesn't hear me listening to the story from the upset friend  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say "thank you" no the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe
what's with the plastic picnic ware? why not try ours  afraid it isn't clean?
i see the help  judgement call
just give yourself a little pep talk "must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out"
what's wrong with your son anyway?
he's gotta fight to breathe his asthma can just shoot off the charts  he's allergic to dust and this is new york and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection  is this bothering you?
no
i heard ya lady is wild
an ear infection can send us to the emergency room  maybe five six times a month where i get whatever nineyearold they just made a doctor nice chatting with you
his name?
spencer
okay
so what are you doing with a dog?
suckered in set up pushed around
you're not worried that someone might take him?

no  that's her second cousin who's married to li'l bit

otherwise you're not ugly
okay pal  i accept the compliment but go easy  my knees start aknocking when you turn on the charm full blast
last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it and so i decide i'm going to make a little joke
i'm hungry  you've upset my whole day i haven't eaten
this is not a sexist thing if you were a waiter i would still be here saying
are you totally gone? this is my private home
i am trying to keep emotions out of this even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject
oh because on our first date she let me
what subject? that i wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
yes i do as a matter of fact and to prove it i have not gotten personal and you have why aren't you at work? you're not sick  you don't look sick just very tired and bitter
what about your mother?
how do you know about my mother?
sorry honey  i'll be right there
yeah yeah  any chance you'll get back to work today?
uh udall?
carol the waitress?
the doctors had your billing address i'm sorry about the hour
i was working  can't you just drop me a thankyou note?
no she didn't
that's not why i'm here    though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer

yes i'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore
okay
hey what i did for you is working out?
no no thank you notes
well part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother my son and me than anyone else ever has and that makes you the most important surprising generous person i've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever
lovely
i heard different thought that was
nice of you thank you
thank you
oh i'm sorry didn't i say "what?" i thought i said "what?" what?
i want you to go on this trip
no sir
i can't do this alone i'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me i need you to chaperon separate everything but cars you said you liked convertibles now i'm on the hook
the stiff one eye?
two days
i can't i work
you take off when you have to
not that time
my son
bettes tells me he's doing fine
melvin i'd rather not
what's that got to do with it?
funny i thought it was a strong point
write me a note and ain't she sweet i need a hand and where'd she go
are you saying accepting your help obligates me?
is there another way to see it?
hello?
are you still coming?
so when are you comin' to pick us up?
melvin i'd like to know exactly where we are going
just south to baltimore maryland so i know what you're going to ask next  that you might ask  i'm not certain
there's there's no need to bring anything dressy or i mean  i didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes
oh  we might yes we can let's
okay gotcha what did you think i was going to ask?
whether crabs are in season there now
hi
thanks for being on time carol the waitress this is simon the fag
i was going to do that for you
it's okay no problem where should we sit?
he's from antigua  his girlfriend was taking too long to put her makeup on they were late for a party  stabbed her with a beer bottle
around
i  uh i well there is no place cards or anything
thanks melvin
i'm sure simon they did something real off for you to feel this way but when it comes to your partners  or your kid  things will always be off for you unless you set it straight maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance
nonsense
hey  you let him
 my father didn't leave his room for 11 years  he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano
that's not true some of us have great stories pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad just not anybody in this car but lots of people  that's their story  good times and noodle salad and that's what makes it hard not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good
no answer maybe we should just drive there tomorrow can i have that one?
my son was outside playing soccer i never saw him playing ball come on you guys  take me out for a good time take me out dancing
stop asking everyone
too early
no i'm not wearing that  and just in case you were going to ask i'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either
you wanna dance?
i've been thinking about that since you brought it up before
and?
no wait what? why? i didn't mean it you gotta sit down you can still give me the dirty look just sit down and give it to me
melvin pay me a compliment i need one and quick you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings
that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away never fails
that's not compliment melvin that's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid a compliment is something nice about somebody else now or never
and mean it
two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer  baked or fries?
then what about
fries
i am so afraid you're about to say something awful
don't be pessimistic it's not your style okay here i goes clearly a mistake  i have this  what? ailment and my doctor  a shrink who i used to see all the time he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help i hate pills very dangerous things pills "hate" i am using the word "hate" about pills my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never  well you were there you know the next morning i started taking these pills
that's maybe the best compliment of my life
so how are you doing with those pills? well i hopahopahopa
have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
never
you don't owe me that
well ah that's a personal question
if you ask me i'll say "yes"
too late maybe around
there are lots of reason i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might
sex with simon?
it's one idea
that's why you brought me? look at me is that really why you brought me like i'm a what and i owe you what?
i don't know why i brought you  that idea occurred to me is all it came out first hey you kiss him  me he says he loves you you two hit it off but you don't want to fine forget what i said about sex with simon it was a mistake
i'll never forget you said it
sorry didn't realize she was right there  did you have sex with her?
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home
let me see ahh gorgeous
i don't want to hear that music right now

i'll take a bus
i'll take you why not?
hello
yeah well

like grits and butter
i had to see you
because

if you need an excuse there's a bakery on the corner there's a shot it'll open soon  that way we're not screwy  we're just two people who like warm rolls
i'm feeling i've been feeling better
hey i've got a great compliment for you
you know what? i
i fell out of my bed last night

i'm sorry are you okay?
well considering everything's horrible and tomorrow i have to face my parents don't ask me  i'm sick of my own complaints  got to get me a new set of thoughts
why? what have you been thinking about?
how to die mostly
good night
i've got to sketch you
no absolutely not i'm shyer than you think i give the wrong impression sometimes and
that's unique
i slept too near where i fell out
i haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks
stop staring do a vase
but you're beautiful your skin glows
thanks but i just want to take a bath and
that long neck  the line of you you're porcelain your back goes on forever you're classic you're why cavemen chiseled on walls
we held each other it was better than sex what i need he gave me great
but what about
one night with me
i love you  let him take you home
what the heck are those for?
sleep 'n eat what's the matter with you?  using all dose ten dollar words?
no no get carol
i'm filling in we don't know if she's coming back she might have to get a job closer to home
what are you trying to do to me?
what the heck do you mean?
help
if you want to see me you will not do this you will make an appointment
explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like i have any choice in barging in
you said you could help me  what was that  a tease?
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app 
you changed the room around
mantan it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
i also regrew my beard  but you're not interested in changes in me so it's like i always told you  when it comes to people you
shhhhhhh i don't have this mountain of available time  i got to get to my restaurant on time do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
he's genuinely upsetting isn't he?
hey hey  haaa  bad but temporary the nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago  the hand will come back  they're sure
so what's new anyway? how's verdell?
your neighbor  udall  is taking care of him
how could you do that? he'll hurt him
no i promise  not a chance i own this guy there was no one else i'm on the move too much trust me
you are very certain my dog is okay  because you have no idea
i'm sorry that i'm not taking you
hold on you allegorical hypothesis don't cross words with me
simon you've got to get dressed
definitely a package you don't want to open or touch
no touch no touch no touch
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude but i grew up in hell my grandmother had more attitude you don't intimidate me
police police fucking crooked police  doughnutmunching morons help me  assault and battery and you're black
you're taking him  yes  you're taking him  this will clear the books one night you want to say "no" to me? try  because i've never felt as nuts as i do right this second i almost want you to try saying "no"
i'm not saying nothing to you
hey where are you going? you can't do this  i can't take a dog  nobody's ever been in here before
how's verdell doing?
simon's home i was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust
ain't jemima on the pancake box?
it's been five weeks  another few won't kill me
no he wants him back he'll be by tomorrow
it's not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind  but he did throw up twice and his spark is off
sure  take him to the vet
i did and his stomach is out of whack so they need him for a couple of days
she's nice
really nice shouldn't that be a good thing telling someone 'no thanks required'
what?
"what?" look at you you sense a mark
hey  you called me i
dat's yo uncle ben  that reminds me i've seen a lot of troubles lately
about a dog
yeah but it's all about simon now you helped with the dog and now there are other things i'm just as concerned as you are about simon
concerned i'm just the hall monitor here
it's not only financial assistance what he's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money it's not going to happen on the phone

sure thing
you're a wonderful man two o'clock is a good time here's the key in case he's asleep open the curtains for him so he sees god's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best
okay so you call 911 and don't leave your name  even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name how come you make a mistake like that?

well i work all the time so never never again interrupt me okay? i mean never not 30 years from now not if there's fire not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudgepacker you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states and he's going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone  don't knock   not on this door not for anything got me sweetheart?
yes it's not a subtle point you're making
that's some face they left hanging on you you look like
thank you verdell  sweetheart?  by the way thanks for saving me
i hope this prick doesn't run  my knees are killing me  stay behind me
i feel a song a comin' on

maybe i'll bring him some food by
if you'll excuse me i'm not feeling so well
it smells like shit in here?
go away
that cleaning woman doesn't

nellie you're a disgrace to depression
people show their happiness in a lot of different ways
rot in hell melvin

get out
i carry bacon in my pocket
oh my gosh
now we'll both call him
come on sweetheart
would you leave now please?
i brought you chinese soup
thanks
a lot?
i have never been so tired in my life okay if i sit here?
i haven't been sleeping i haven't been clear or felt like myself i'm in trouble some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back  but the tiredness  boy  not just sleepy
but sick  nauseous  where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches  when you can barely get up the will to complain
i uh i was attacked walked in on people robbing me i was hospitalized i almost died
that's very thoughtful
well i always painted always and my mother always encouraged it she was sort of fabulous about it actually and she used to i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it and she was very natural she used to pose nude for me and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it
not it at all really
do you ever get an erection for a woman?
melvin
wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not
so what's up with you?
you consider your life easy
i get why you're angry it's no snap to explain why i was like that but let's not try to do it on the run
 now he's going to want to stay and they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever so it's a good five hours back it gives us a chance to take it easy and
what are you talking about? you got real problems
goodbye  well your luck is holding they sublet your place you're homeless frank's got a line on another place you can use for now
another place where?
i told you to go on in
i think you gotta camp it here
thank you melvin you overwhelm me
they did a nice job cozy huh?
what do you want to know?
sorry didn't know you were awake i just thought verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then
you going to come talk to me or not?
what did she say?
i'm a great guy  "extraordinary"   and she doesn't want contact with me  i'm dying here
because   you love her?
no and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp
okay you tell me why   "you're dying here"
i don't know let me sleep on it and figure it out  because i'm stuck can't go back to what i had she's evicted me from my life
did you like it that much?
it was better than this look you i'm very intelligent if you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope you got to be better than you're doing if you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up i'm drowning and you're describing water
the good stuff
picking on me won't help
well if that's true then i'm really in trouble
but you know where you're lucky?
absolutely not
you know who you want i'll take your seat any day so do something don't sleep on it go over there i don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything  it's not always good to let things calm down
hey i'm charged here but she might kill me for showing up this late
then get in your jammies and i'll read you a story i think you've got a chance the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically  the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever  so go catch her off guard
what's wrong?
i can't resist you usually move through here so quickly and i have so many questions i want to ask you you have no idea what your work means to me
what's it mean?
i'm an asthmatic  been one all my life  can't go anywhere without an inhaler
that somebody out there knows what it's like to be  in here
oh god this is like a nightmare
how do you write women so well?
exactly what is your previous experience?
nothing i just watch till something strikes me do anything you think of  try different thing until i say "hold that pose" then just try and comfortably hold it
the fact that you haven't said "hold it" means i haven't done it right  is that correct? i haven't done it right?
so you're practically finished huh?
wait  i want to see the painting
just a second  he has to go
why are you doing this?
what else?
is there a problem?
no  no problem  the airport right?
yeah  yeah i'm a waiter
where?
what?
what restaurant?
uh fontella's
so you're from around here?
where you from?
what is this?
this is a nice place  it must have cost a pretty penny
not too good at small talk eh?
look i'm real tired and i'm not interested in fucking chitchat
why?  what happened?
didn't you here all them sirens? it's been all over the radio  some guy shot leevio valli and a bunch of bystanders in the trattoria roma
no shit
yeah it's terrible  i mean valli and i don't care what office he's running for the guy's a crook  he probably had it coming but all the other people  real sad
yeah
but they caught the guy  i heard it all  sounded like he just went berserk fucking loco  shooting anybody  drugs probably
probably
what are you doing?
sloan i got it like 'dat
what?
that was peterson back there  that goes to the expressway for the airport
you're right  talking too much again
yeah well you just blew your tip pal
what?  you think i'm running you up?
what are you doing?
get out  you think i'm running you up?  get out
you can't 
sit back  put your seatbelt on
no fucking way
i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
ready?
oh you do huh?
boy that's fucking genius  you're a fucking genius  then you're just sitting there bullshitting with me man no way i coulda done that
what's your name?  we both know it's not nicholai
bain  michael bain
how long have you been freelance?
hey  what i don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  i mean you had me a free shot  that's what i would have done
it's just a shootout then  sixty forty at best  not my odds
you don't have to tell me that it's just i know my bid was low but was it too low?  i mean did i seem like an amateur like i didn't know what i was doing?
oh  i got a question  jesus this has been driving me crazy for years  shit listen to me  i sound like some fucking fanboy  i'm sorry but i just got to ask you  everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian nicholai talinkov 
tachlinkov
robert bain driving me  jesus fucking christ
just a little something' somethin'
after those cops you'll never be able to come back to cleveland
so what happens now?
we go around once
okay
what are you doing?
no no  wait  you don't want me to jump  you're going to jump  i'm stuck back here until it's too late wham  over
how'd you know?  just tell me that how'd you fucking know?
i knew the same way in ten years you're going to know
what does that fucking mean?
listen to me bain  two days ago you contacted your contractor who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell you don't know how they got the information  it bothered you but you didn't care  how do i know this?  because ten years ago i was sitting in that chair as scared shitless as you are now
i hope you save a little somethin' somethin'
i ain't scared of you
yeah you are and you hate it  you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't  that you're sweating your balls off and i'm not you've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid all because of me
if you think you can take me quit fucking bullshitting and try it
five million dollars?
that's right
did you see how i did that?  magic wasn't it?
what?
you understand what's going on?  it makes sense right?
oh yeah
you think i would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars
gots no intention of ending up broke
you would be
you don't know a fucking thing about me  you don't have the slightest fucking clue
why don't you tell me
i'll tell you this  after cleveland i thought i was lucky to be alive  but now here i just realized that you were the lucky one
game over bitch
i'm on the scent
michael?
no  no  no  i don't believe it
they money will be standard bank transfer  we believe we will know where and when
such language in front of a lady
y'know at the beginnin' of the century africanamerican had to perform in blackface  you ever heard of bert williams?  he was a great artist
how in the fuck do you know that?
hi  up ahead my boss is in that black limo  we're not sure which hotel we're at so could you just follow them?
good afternoon  we have reservations at the hotel paraiso in costa blanca
no no  i said the hotel paraiso
yes  this is the hotel paraiso
no the other hotel paraiso in the city  near the plaza del sol
i'm sorry sir  a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso this is the new hotel paraiso
where have you been robert?
sick  the flu
send the file  i'll have the estimate tonight
no before my time
what?
who?
how did he know?
know what?
i don't know what the fuck you are
deadline?
who is the mark?
hello robert
the contract?
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you
you don't read do you?
i know what happened
i bet you fucking know
i give a fuck?  i'm done  i quit do you fucking hear me  i'm fucking gone
is this how it went nick?
you think this is a fucking joke?
a player?
what?
he has to clean up  how many bodies were there?
um five
get on the expressway
never read a book in my whole life
nikita?  she helped me find you
what?  how did you know i had a cat?
took a guess  lucky for you i guessed right
who the fuck are you?  who do you work for?
i work for the government
bullshit
yeah
you're one of them aren't you?  a fucking pro
twenty large?  that's all?
what do you mean 'that's all'? what in the hell do you know?
maybe you need to start
i figure that means these are worth ten times that maybe more
ten million 
now what?
you want me to pump?
okay  how did you find me?
you're the computer hacker you tell me
nikita?
you're one of them aren't you?
'them'?
an assassin?
maybe i need to do a lot of things
until a minute ago
what does that mean?
who is that other guy?
another contractor
someone hired both of you?
no  they hired bain  the contract would have been mine but bain took it from me as he took the previous one
so this is something between you and him?
he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him
why?
because he is trying to retire me
keep them out of my way
why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  this blackface thing was part of the deal from the gitgo don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this  you down with delacroix
he wants to kill you?
yes
why?
the nature of the business  you remove your competition
and you want to use me to get him?
yes
forget it
don't tell me i don't have a choice
right
i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you
i just don't want you and cheeba to get hurt
it's simple  you need me  i need you  and we will both need money
i don't need you to get the money  my money
i don't need the money
this is something that is never going to end  you can never work in the business again with this contract because he will find you to survive you have to go into deep hiding  and that's going to take money a lot of money
then you can have the disks and i'll just walk out that door 
if you walk out that door bain will still come after you
why?
because he took a contract on you he'll come for you and he'll find you
you don't know that  you're trying to scare me
no  it's the truth  i know what you are  like me like bain you're a ghost you're not part of the real world  you don't have a social security number  you don't pay taxes  you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years  a long time ago something probably happened something illegal and you ran you disappeared and it was easy  you think you can do it again  but i'm telling you fading from the law is nothing  no matter what you do where you go i swear to you that bain will find you
why don't you call him?
how?
oh jesus jesus
listen  i don't even know your name
rath  robert rath
electra
just electra?
yeah
as in daughter of agamemnon?
what i'm trying to say is that  i'm not sure i can do this help you unless i know more about you
what do you want to know?
you're sure this is a good idea
no
why?
because i'm done
with computers
it's not the same is it?
had?
it looks like white's game
we played with a code using <u>the new</u> <u>york times</u> obituaries  over three years we played twelve matches  i never won
he was taken
i killed him
i'll be down front  you better start putting your face on
why?
because that's how it works  that's what it's about  he was the best he was on top
where you wanted to be?
yes  as soon as you get into this business all you can think about is getting to the top  that's all there is  until then there is nothing  you are nothing
how did you get into the business?
the same way everyone does; the government the agency
the cia?
more or less
how old were you?
they recruited me when i was in high school
y'know what?
jesus  why?
languages  i was already fluent in nine languages
you were like a boy genius?
some people said that  i never thought so
why not?
i was just different
you went from high school to the agency?
no  i graduated from george washington university  then i entered the agency training program
they didn't give you a choice did they?
no they didn't
what?
but you knew what they were training you for?
of course  i was going to be james bond
ahhhh
they are very good at what they do it's very seductive  the training the weapons the travel 
the exotic women
women?  no not really
why not?
women i don't i don't want to talk about women
why?
because you are a women
how did you get this gig?
why did you leave the agency?
the same reason everyone does  you hear your name on cspan and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you
they tried to kill you?
yes  it didn't matter much to them as long as i disappeared
then you went freelance?
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government so you make more money  then once you make the transition you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets
tell me about the first time
my first take?
yes
why?
worked my black ass off first as an intern then worked my way up to this position
because i want to know
it was mechanical  very precise it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline
are they usually like that?
no  just the first one
after that?
they become complicated messy
did it ever bother you?
did it ever bother james bond?
that's fiction
this is fiction  don't you see that?  this is another reality  and the people that come into the world to play this game  nobody forces them  they're here they know the rules the stakes the risks  do you understand what i am saying?  no one is innocent  including you
you leave something out?
is that what you wanted to hear? something cold blooded something remorseless
it  tell it  for all i know it could be a machine
you said you didn't trust it
do you have a passport?
several
good
where is it?
hey where are you?
thinking
about?
okay  you ready?
after my internship expired dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant
i've never been to the gulf of mexico  is it as nice as they say?
i don't know
that's where he'll be
what?
no
why not?
it helps me to focus  it centers me helps me think
oh  what do you think about?
do you think about the game?
yes
and?
but you've never figured out a way to win
no
not even a stalemate?
no
what will you do if this works if we get the money?
i don't know maybe i'll live on a boat sail to all the places i've never been
i'm kind of tired  i think i'd like to try and get some sleep
do you think he's here?
here?
in costa blanca
and what?
what do you think he's doing?
breakfast
i know what you are thinking  i'm not going to disappear okay?  i'm not going anywhere just down there to that beautiful beach  i got to get out of this room just for a little while
okay
really?
he won't be looking for you  just be careful  buy a book  keep your sunglasses on
you should knock
sorry
how was the beach?
where did you learn it?
stop playing me sloan
taiwan
not that i would know but you look like you're really good at it
thank you
i've always wanted to learn something like that
two way?
transmits and receives
i paid a lot for these
they saw you coming a mile away  if i had known we'd be using 
it's too late now  okay?  we'll have to deal with these
this is the bank  this is the hotel  in the morning i will enter the bank
just ask me what you want to know
check
he will be hidden somewhere out here probably somewhere low in the crowd  he'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank
but he won't shoot you right then?
you'll be here  a restaurant  a public place far enough away that he won't notice you but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside
okay  then what?
then we wait
aiiee  more waiting?  i don't know if i like this plan
the sun will be low almost dark the air cool and the bank will almost be closed  5:45  5:50  he will put the rifle down he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank
why won't he wait until the bank closes?
he won't be able to  he'll have to go inside  he'll have to see with his own eyes whether or not i am there  if the bank closes he won't know for sure  he'll come  i'm sure  and when he does you'll go into the hotel go upstairs and take the gun
oh you gonna make me say it
he can't  the bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and xray machines
that means you won't have a gun
that's right
and with the mikes i'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank
if things go well i don't have to you'll already be in a rented car waiting for me
you'll have the money  how do i know that you won't 
i'll be walking out of the bank unarmed  you'll have the gun and i'll drive the car
we split the money?
five million apiece  you get on your plane i get on mine
sounds pretty well figured out
say what manray?
i've been thinking about it for a long time
except 
what?
except if he doesn't come out of the hotel
i told you he will
you can't know for sure how can you?  i mean you're not him
ten years ago i sat there in that same hotel window sweat pouring off of me waiting 
for nicholai?
yes
what is it?  i don't like this at all  what is going on here?
did you ever sleep with dela?
i don't know  it just happened  i was here ten years ago i'm here now  that's it
i don't believe that
it wasn't planned or premeditated i swear  things happened beyond my control  i understood; i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense
ten years ago
yes
what happened?
i waited until i was insane and then i walked into the bank  he was sitting there very calm waiting for me
what did he want?
he wanted what i want now; to get out of the business  to disappear to some empty greek island
what did he say?
we did it one time only once  it had nothing to do with the job it was stupid  everything i've got i've earned
he said i couldn't win  that no one wins at this game
was that it?
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away to quit the business
you didn't take it
no  i went back to the hotel  and waited
ten years later here you are again
do you have ulcers?
no
i think i got one today
why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
aw c'mon
i hate bishops  they're useless  i like knights
they're worth less points
did you think they were newlyweds?
i didn't notice them
when i first saw them i thought they were married
how do you know they're not?
i went into their room this afternoon
what?
it was no big deal  i saw them leave i went in
jesus if someone had 
any chance we can do that again?
so you say  sloan you wuz gonna use me up just like you used dela? work it to the top  i never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "ihop"  i'm damn happy dela fired ya ass
nobody ever sees me
why in the hell would you take that chance?
she is married but not to him another man much older  she has four kids  the young guy works for her  and i think she likes kinky sex
thank you
isn't it interesting though?  i mean look at us in this room  or yesterday when we were walking in the plaza market  i mean we look like just another couple  but what are we?  doesn't it seem so crazy?
no
no?
it's always been that way  the world has always functioned on two levels
i know  it makes me crazy
why?
forget about me are you a puppet for dela?
i don't know  when i was in college i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor
and you were drilling these holes?
so i could watch the girl that lived under me
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of selfpreservation
did he explain how this happened?
what are you doing?
what?
that's a ridiculous move
why?
don't try to change to the subject
because i'll take it
can i ask you something?
i'm sure you will
yes
are you attracted to me?
yes
why?
why?  i don't know
is it a physical thing or a mental thing?
is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
why don't you answer?
i didn't want to complicate the situation
attraction is a complication?
it can be
it happened to you before?
yes
who was she?
someone like me like you  a pro
what happened to her?
she was taken
did you 
i know i won't be your puppet
no  i tried to stop it  i couldn't
was she the only one?
after her i realized that to survive i had to live without it's dangerous to let things become complicated
is this becoming complicated?
were you attracted to me right away?
no
when did it start?
honestly?
uhhuh
when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me
you can go now
maybe you should see a psychiatrist
why?
that doesn't sound normal
i'm not normal
martin
four minutes
what?
i waited another four minutes
shit
wait until he is on the stairs
good day to you young sir
right
i'm taking off my mike
okay
electra 
what?
was nice
he's coming electra  get out now
i wasn't watching television
the point is they are paying for information  real information  not tooth paste brands  not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper  and no 16 hours of recorded phone sex you are wasting everyone's time with this shit
i thought it was interesting 
good morning
god damnit electra  this is not a game  this is business
right  in my hands i have five backup disks he made of all of his work last night
jesus  why didn't you tell me?
i'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus
electra 
hi  did you call 
i prefer it like this
would you like a drink?
why are you working today?
you're very good at this aren't you?
where are you bound for?
that's okay hon i always expect the unexpected
for what?
do you ever regret things you've done?
everyone regrets something
but when you finlsh a job afterwards do you think about them?
sometimes
do you think about their wives or their families?
do you ever think about starting over?
all the time
then i'll sail alone
that is none of your business
do you believe that?
is that all you want?
thank you
how much farther?
hey do you mind if i talk a little?  i feel like i don't know talking i guess
sure
funny i've never been a talker my wife was always getting on me about that  'say what you feel tell me what's bothering you you ve got to talk to me'  i never would though  not really
why not?
i think i've heard of you
it's possible
okay  you work in a vodka factory  i understand that  and what kind of work do you do?
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
you're pretty famous aren't you?
i hope not
i know this may seem like a strange question but can i ask you how much the contract was for  not to insult you or anything i know you're a professional but just for me i was just wondering
it's a common question
oh yeah?  i guess we still need to see that price tag  like art right?  you hang some painting that looks like babypuke in your living room only if it costs a bundle
a dime
one hundred thousand?  that's it? jesus is that a lot?
average
i have been thinking about this for a long while  i knew this day was coming  i knew someday someone would make the call on me i never thought about anyone that i had whacked  what do you call it anyway?
taken
and i'll tell you what mr dugan i've been insulted grossly in this house  i ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on i'm an englishman i am and a man of property; and i  i 
'taken'  that's nice  when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them
everyone who plays the game knows the rules
don't know  that's how it works
that's what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
right
i thought that i would be thinking about margaret or work or that i'd be having these deep profound and depressing thoughts but i'm not  i'm trying to think really profound thoughts but i can't it seems very funny to me
what are you thinking about?
i'm thinking about moonpies  ain't that funny?  i haven't had a moonpie since i was ten years old right now i'm thinking how much i'd love one
can i ask you something?
go ahead
both of us ride home with best here
everyone handles it differently some are ready some are not
do they get down on their knees begging and crying?
some
when i thought about this that was always there in the back of my head that image of me on my knees crying  it wouldn't go away and it would really upset me it was something that i could never get away from but now i feel it's okay  i feel good
can i ask you a question?
anything
why didn't you fade?
you mean quit?
yeah
i used to think about it  i had margaret  she wanted kids  i thought about moving somewhere far away like europe  i could see all of that the first part the getting away but i couldn't see that next part  'then what?' so i'd stop thinking about it and go back to work  you understand?
i'm not afraid of highwaymen  my man is armed and so am i
look at that  i haven't watched the sun set in a million years do you mind?
you wish to close this account today?
that's correct
how would you like the funds?
american currency
this will take some time
excellent senor  if you could follow me?
i'm sorry but i am waiting for an associate  can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
of course senor
that's true doug writers are supposed to write
there's nothing else for it  take your ground grogan  twelve paces i suppose?
what are you having?
a coke if they have it?
cheers katka
naz draviwhat do you like about this place these people chris?
i don't know it's kind of underground doug's right there's too much crap in this town
i used to think he was right about a lot of things but now i don't know i thought he was going somewhere but now i think i am wasting my time
so how's your work?
it's okay they're training me on the cash register and after i hope to work on one of the jewellery counters
sounds cooldo you think he's serious about squatting a place?
i don't know i don't care i see too much of him and he's changed he used to be busy at the magazine but now he's been doing nothing for months like he doesn't care about anything including me
ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan?
well he sure seems fired up all of a sudden
it won't last believe me and you when will you go back to the states?
your a good guy chris you deserve a nice girl
like you?
he_s the closest we've got to an intellectual
fresh from the shrink i'd say
what is it with that josh guy? who does he think he is shoving that reflections rag down our throats?
son of the american ambassador and a banker  good enough?
how to make a buck
yeah righti don't know something isn't right with this place it's all too sterile and staged do you ever wonder why there's no czechs here?
hoitytoity  john best what's the matter here?
because it's in english?
yeah but it's not just that to the czech mind any movement whether political or literary should be underground if it isn't then it's not radical and not worthy of a lookin
but we are underground?
inspirations a fickle thing you don't realise you had it till it's gone
you guys having a go a me or what?
we're only jokingit is your round though
sorry katka but i'm with doug on this
what about that squat bar you showed me is that open on a sunday?
anything in it?
no just crap i want some picture frames
i'll tell you what it is mr dugan i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways  i ain't used to 'em sir
i don't have the money for those bourgeois traps hell i'm making what a czech earns
it all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs if i'd been here ten years ago maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today
what's that? free
just because they've got a choice of four mcdonalds doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger
who's your friend?
hmmsmells good cheers
what did the beer cost?
fifteen crowns
this place is getting expensive too used to be twelve
oh yeah what's that?
well well  what is it?  we'll make you used to our ways or adopt english ones
an alternative literary venue
i ain't sure poetry will go down too well here
no it's the whole idea behind it how did they get this place?
squatted it
right and not just the bar lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building
what we need is a space for real performance art a cultural exchange for radical expressionism
he's not drunk he's crazy
maybe but someone's got to make a stand
like custer huh?
good news comrades it's better than we'd hoped lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake
it's not the english way for ladies to have two lovers and so mr dugan i'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and i resign all claims to this young lady  if she has a fancy for schoolboys let her take 'em sir
care to elaborate?
well providing we're treated like czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned we should be in the clear; at least doug  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs
amazing he didn't even say "if"
okay we're listening but i'm with katka on this one
well it's like i said there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city so they're not private now jahn here is an drama student at the university he knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre  they even began work on it until they ran out of money
puppet theatre don't you need something a little bigger?
okay it's in here somewhere let's keep it quiet
you were right jahn it's a great space hey chris do you want to come and look?
chris what if i were to cut you in as partner in this project  together we could make it swing all it needs is a good clean out and the power on then we're in business
i don't know man i'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime but this is different
i am butcher
pooh  pooh  best you are joking
damn right it is it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change to leave our mark on this town hell you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a led zep' song  c'mon don't run out on me now
alright i give in but let's not end up in jail okay?
no i got nothing till tuesday
that stinks
no but like my dad said "there's only so many ways you can wire a plug"
he was an electrician?
no he was talking about girls i think
that makes you an expert i guess
i feel like a mole in this joint so i guess i might as well come out lookin' like one
just two things what do i use to shift the stuff and where in hell am i gonna put it all?
my companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about england which i answered as best i might  but this best i am bound to say was bad enough  i knew nothing about england and i invented a thousand stories which i told him; described the king and the ministers to him said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him
scout around and see if there's something check that other corridor if there's nothing nip out and buy a broom and shovel
and put it on expenses?
somehow i'm going to have to bandaid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it
so?
well we might as well start filling it in now as long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe  so i can get to it we're set use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space  we'll neaten it up later
not bad hey i think i'll add sparkie to my resumegood shovel
yeah you're in luck there's two of them the other's in there
later mate right now i've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time
i thought that was part of the charm
i'll drill the locks and replace the barrels that way it won't cost so much
what is your uncle's name?
a locksmith too? why d'you ever bother with writing?
i'm making history chris nothings going to stop me there could be a knighthood for us in this once president havel hears
i'll settle for a pardon you gotta drill?
nobut i think honza at the office has you keep shifting this crap and i'll take care of the locks shouldn't take long take a break for lunch and i'll catch you up later
and if the police stop by  what do i tell them?
tell them we're working for the university
thought of everything haven't you
yep except a name for this place
wowwhat have you been doing rolling around in it?
no just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment that's all
o'grady
well don't get carried away
i'll try not to i'll leave that to you anyway there's still plenty more of it
no why?
'cause you stink of booze
yeah that was honza's idea i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear
i'm an idiot?
nope not even close i've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though
really "the freeman centre"?
nothe asylum
oh yeah what's my connection to that?
this is a very good inn  shall we stop for dinner?
none it's mine  you said it earlier i'm nuts
i've been saying that since we met
perfect but i can't use it right now i've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities
yeah i'm beginning to see that
i don't know but that used to be a window and i think that was a door
can you do the lock on it?
it must be on the other side of this
but how did the wall get here?
i'd love to get in there
don't we have enough already?
this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland  corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach
it must be fair old size suppose it's empty?
and suppose a little old lady lives there?
no way it's sealed  if she's in there she's dead
sounds like a good reason to leave it alone
well it's definitely there  we've just got to get to it
why how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
i'll rig up something don't worry  do you think i could bash through with that little hammer?
i don't know doug we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it
look i gotta get going shouldn't you have met katka?
need any disks?
ah  you sly rogue i see that will influence you
yeah her name's kavlova why?
see if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls give it a bit of atmosphere
moved on to plumbing huh?
i thought you were gonna throw these?
i had a better idea we'll burn them there's a drum across the road; i was just waiting for the workers to go home
destroy the evidence huh
have you ever stolen anything?
nope
could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
like helping a sick kid?
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
no for the asylum
close
just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better
what's that five instead of ten years jail
perfect
it looks new they might miss one or two
we're going to need it all
jesus doug they'll execute us
let's split
not yet we need a few lengths of scaffold
where's the beauty you promised me?
why don't we just take the whole damn building brick by brick doug
look at it this way it's their contribution if we'd explained it to them they'd probably have given it to us anyway
so why didn't we?
afternoon
am i late?
no not if you've got better things to do
like a hand?
do you think anyone will really come here?
fancy some lunch after we_re through with this meccano shit?
we'd better get some booze in for tonight
upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly
you should have said it was bringabottle
here let's both put in two hundred crowns that should get nine or ten bottles of wine
no beer?
you get the wine and i'll go see if i can rustle up some plastic cups
why don't we go together?
red or white?
i see you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine
have you cleared all the rubble up?
no not yet
get me a couple of beers and a salami
you're a butcher?  what do you use pig intestines for?
i have acted as i think fit
we could make a start on the floor afterwards
no we aren't going to do it
thanks come on chris give me a hand
my god what happened?
i fell in love
and a tram hit you?
no the boyfriend
what happened to katka?
didn't i tell you she dumped me monday night
you romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes  anyone i know?
sir i'm a british officer
holly
couldn't keep your hands off the hired help huh?
it just happened
she's as american as apple pie too have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
she's cool
a fine specimen for conversion
what are you on about?
don't tell me you really are in love?
yeah and i got the bruises to prove it so what?
chris can you do me a favour?
it's a lie  you're a deserter you're an impostor sir; your lies and folly have confirmed this to me you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know  will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up?
what?
take the drill back to honza at the office i promised to get it back for the weekend and i don't want to show my face there
you might make henry happysure i'll do it
shit no it'll be twice cost
you capitalist pig
does jahn's thing have a name?
it's me you want i'm responsible for all this
chris tell me some good news
tell me some bad news?
i don't want to ruin your day
good morning private james  please come in  i should like you to meet my uncle herr minister of police galgenstein
that bad?
your too good for this town buddy
so i hear
huh?
i had a visit from the british embassy they think i'm a stray soccer hooligan
i stopped by your office henry was steaming he says he's going to throw you out of the window and that you never worked at the bugler
he got that one right
they're good guys have you seen holly?
no but i ran into jahn seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the university they might even be expelled
damn
the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police herr galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion
did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
yeah i tell you they're one big happy family over there
what happened?
i don't know i'm waiting for the transcript
you're kidding
well the trial's in two weeks but i think they've already sentenced me they just need to check if siberia can slot me in
we gotta think of something
now you're using that word
you know there is one thing i can't figure out all along they've been bugging me about those files and when i told them i'd burned all that stuff they went nuts  they told the consul guy they were medical records?
so?
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well  and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas
well it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files
lucky break
maybe but i've started to wonder what those files were all about suppose it was old kgb stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police that might explain all the hassle and the coverup
did you see anything in the files?
it was all in czech wasn't it
what happened to those disks i gave you have you still got them?
yeah somewhere?
suppose those contained all the file info too? you could have a third or so of it there
do you want me to see what's on them?
no point it'll be in czech and god knows what format but if i'm right they could be my ticket out of here
what is the service sir?
and if you're wrong
siberia
what do you want me to do?
get me one of the disks ask a czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to reuters and be ready to send it if this doesn't work you'd better keep clear of your apartment too do you know someone with a phone?
yeah dave walters
it's42 56 76 
42 56 76 okay you wait at dave's for my call tomorrow if you don't hear from me by three o'clock send that note and get out of the country fast
doug i can't just leave you
if i cut a deal i'm not staying in this country and i want holly to come with me so if she doesn't come here today you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after i call promise?
sureanything else i can do for you?
you are a hungarian; you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins  he gambles a great deal and wins  do you know the cards well?
god i think i need a holiday
some deal you did there
what about me?
time for lunch i think i'll get the sandwiches what would you like holly?
yeah no problem
i can't go with him
you don't understand i can't
i made a deal with josh

it was a condition of getting doug out
only a very little as soldiers do
what are you talking about?
in return for doug's freedom i was never to see him again i had to  it was his only chance
you mean josh's father had nothing to do with it?
no
you're sure?
well he should be on his way back to his apartment by now

you say he drives after breakfast and before dinner  when he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box and the coachman will get his orders to move on
no
well i'll try and get that clarified as i understand it though the charges include break and enter theft trespass operating an unlicensed facility vandalism and destruction of government documents  whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
they didn't look like medical files to me
well a plea of ignorance won't go far here frankly i think you deserve everything that's coming

you mean you don't know henry we got a bunch of anarchists controlling a sixlevel block of luxury apartments down on janovska street here in the old town and you don't know about it?
ah so what?
henry these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography right? believe me it won't stop there either next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something henry we've got to stop them the foundation's got to put an end to it
how?
i'm in close with these guys it isn't easy but slowly they're opening up to me give me a month and i'll blow their movement wide open
a month jesus and how do i know you're not crapping me?
you can hold back this months paycheck until i come through with the story
what paycheck? you ain't done nothing
have you taken my message to him?
henry i've been working my tail off on this look all i need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop it'll send those scumbags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the bugler and your board of directors back home
i got a bad feeling about this how much do you need?
there's three thousand and if you don't come through i'm going throw you clean out of that window deal?
and take jiri with you?
what for?
any chance of getting me out on bail?
will they free me?
i don't know  maybe they are talking about it now mr vitovetch is a good friend of the judge
will this thing take long?
no it should be over soon
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
you mean it's started?
of course you can see that lady over there she is recording everything
how do i know what's being said?
no act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other as life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need so deep no light could reach surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display left alone in a rosetinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her paleskin body
i'll put one on the noticeboard too
am i invited?
i thought i'd help out
we don't need you
alright go help chris shovel up the last of the crap
seems a shame
my mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
why are you doing all this what for?
well i've failed at everything else i've done and i can't hack it as a journalist even for the bugler
what's the bugler?
it's a student magazine networked through eastern europe and funded by republican dogooders back in the states
i figured you more as a socialist?
i moving more to communism now it's dying out
a champion of lost causes huh?
no i'm just running scared same as everyone else
we_re not all running away
shall i wash these out?
that's a very handsome sword you have there
is it dry?
what would you like beer?
no just a coffee
i'd better get you to a hospital
it's all my fault i'm so sorry doug
i had it coming from someone
who you saving the dishes for?
don't you have a girlfriend?
i'd better get going do you need a hand to get into bed?
did you take your things over to my place?
it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck  he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly  but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
uhhuh
run into josh?
yeah but it was okay
better than you
hmm i still owe him
why don't we both forget about him?

it's josh's
and now you risk the same fate  if you are killed your mother is all alone in the world
this is your doing?
yes they had nothing to do with it
and you broke into that room?
that's right
you will wish you hadn't
why did you break into that particular building?
it was the biggest i could find
what was the real purpose behind this venture?
a kind of freedom
enjoying our hospitality?
i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body
no
we'll have to see what more we can do for you while you are still our guest
thanks but i don't intend to stay
really
good try mr greenwell but a little late we have analyzed the contents of that drum the remains of the disks are there just as you said
you are playing a very dangerous game i suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are
what is it you want?
i'm not sure it's possible
and the students?
i have the director's word there will be no action against them you may go once we have the disks
oh it's with pistols we fight  you are no match for best with the sword
how do i know this isn't a trap?
you have the letter and my word if you wish you may wait upstairsnow where are the disks?
i'll need to make a phone call
would you like your things now?
yeah
central station locker number 139  combination jfk
we had a deal
that's okay i like the metro it's only a couple of stops from here
hey doug where you been?
no just a drill
i'll match any man with the sword
a drill what are you up to?
nothing i've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all you've got one haven't you?
yeah
and a fifty foot extension lead?
you don't have fifty foot of apartment
sure
give me a break will you how often do i ask you for something?
okay okay but i want it right back it belongs to my father
no problem is it at your place?
great let's break for lunch and i'll buy you a beer on the way
are you married?
but swords are today impossible; captain best is  is lame  he knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night as he was riding home and can scarce move it now
but i have to finish this
so he didn't fire you?
when the hell did you write that?
just yesterday
shit honey you could've told me people might think it's about us
all i'm saying honey is run the thing past me for christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap
i decided to help out at the asylum
josh
yeah so i hear don't you think you should go get changed?
later
not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years
i think we should be going honey
what for?
well for a start you've got to get cleaned up
i don't want to go
come on holly
that's my bag
go to hell
it's more than what you're worth
you bastard
shall i look after the rest?
look here roderick my boy; this is silly business  the girl will marry best mark my words; and as sure as she does you'll forget her  you are but a boy  best is willing to consider you as such  dublin's a fine place and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month here are twenty guineas at your service  make best an apology and be off
honey what a pleasant surprise sorry to keep you waiting
josh i have to speak you it's urgent
of course darling you'd like to apologise?
so what have you got to say for yourself? was he good in bed?
josh i need your help doug's been arrested he's in big trouble i thought maybe your father and the embassy might be able to do something
will you come home and forget all about him?
yes if you can get him free
why are there still such headlines?
this press we cannot control americans i think
you know everyone can be controlled pavel where are you storing the personnel files?
grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which i wanted of my family
in a building belonging to the university in the old town
you are quite sure it's secure?
the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away
you are responsiblewhat has happened?
what are you an idiot
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed
the university cannot do this is the room safe?
so who is in the building?
have you lost all control of this city?
i don't understand it there were a lot of people there last night many americans i believe we should move carefully
i had news of you in dublin  faith you've begun early like your father's son but i think you could not do better than as you have done but why did you not write home to your poor mother?  she has sent halfadozen letters to you in dublin
it was crazy not to have destroyed them
that was not my decision i can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored in the meantime no one else must know those files exist secure the building and i will arrange alternative safe storage immediately
and what of these foreigners?
and there has been enquiries from the american embassy maybe they are involved?
all the more reason to eliminate him
what if his accomplices have made copies?
delay mr greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me then have one of your officers drive him home  i'll see to the rest
very well
so go dance
with you
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office
she's coming over here
that's one girl who can't take a hint
she asleep?
pictures from the play jamie looks pretty 
i'm sorry about how we 
no you're with who you should be it's like she chose you
and i have no idea why
what if they expel you?
kelly wouldn't do that
why not?
i see you are thinking of a certain young lady at duganstown
i'm not hanging i'm fixing my car 
you don't need a car you can't drive for a month go see marvin
'bout what?
your father dropped off an extra check
i don't want his money
it could help with a new car 
out with belinda?
that's over way over
you saw him?
we talked he wanted to get a bite  after i said no
is miss dugan well?
after he moved out i invited him to every practice every game every parentteacher conference you ever had he didn't show not once
he wants to show now
you look nice i should have dressed
you're fine like that mom
there's hot cider in the kitchen
thanks
i haven't seen clay or eric lately
to see your father?
a late night or an early morning?
late night  you?
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
were you with jamie?
yeah
honey some of this is farfetched you take after me people skills and common sense good dependable qualities
i could take after dad too
you do you're handsome and charming
i meant he's a doctor
that's eight years of school and training  after college and all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being
i could do it if i tried even kelly thinks so
but if it doesn't happen grab for something within reach life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment 
have i told you how proud i am of you  ?
good heavens  whatever?  has she died of grief?
i'm sorry i didn't know
i told him to leave me alone
landon 
i have no idea what to say how to act what if i do the wrong thing?
what are you doing here?
he wants to talk to you
now it's okay?
everything's being done but it's not enough i have to find something  more
where is he? he's supposed to be here
i'm thinking
i guess i thought i was protecting you
come to 45 broadway  don't bring the police  come alone or you'll be in my next film
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband  she is now mrs john best
hypotheticals 
don't call him a dipshit

the address?
deranged
she's like some puritan
belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real
and that you're scamming on jamie sullivan
landon
say nothing nothing 'bout her
mrs john best  was there another mr john best?
who are you?
landon carter i was driving the car that 
you
i'm very sorry 
get yourself a glass
he goes to my father's church he could've died 
 this your idea of small talk?
i don't make small talk 
because growing up books were my world
were?
no the very same one my boy  he recovered from his wound  the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him  it was only made of tow do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred ayear out of the family?  the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you  but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
you don't know me
your book and your brown sweater and your hair what's more to know  ?
you mean care what you say? i'm worrying about other things
like what? the moons of jupiter?
can't you have a normal conversation?
i don't want to have any conversation
'i hope your dreams come true'
'they won't'
'is it really me?'
you're like this fly buzzing buzzing everywhere 
the coward
 this play means a lot to me
this play  ?
that's deep 
 your act only works with an audience
i know you don't want help
yeah
why?
fire is like a living thing wild unpredictable

mr o'higgins i cannot say how grateful i am for your timely assistance to my wife
what's with the friggin numbers?
28 is do something illegal 42 is befriend an enemy
i'm an enemy?
the reason i got the part i'm a little like lizzie except i don't worry about some man rescuing me
you got some kind of list?
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
i'll take a chance
go for it
so what else is on this list?
it's private
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls
get very wasted lose your virginity 
spend a year in the peace corps make a medical discovery 
like you'd know
no problem 
i'll get something for us to drink

yeah maybe i dunno
mr o'higgins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin  mister o'higgins i wonder if i know your good father?
cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world
the world of the dead?
what is that?
saturn beautiful
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings 
but there are thousands of them made of floating ice 
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
looking for intelligent life?
do you believe you'll see your mother again?
i'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of haley's comet 
which o'higgins do you know?  for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family
the dirty snowball at its core
yeah  i'm probably not going to be around next time it comes
you're really into god right?
in ten words or less?
yeah
my relationship with god is my own
but you think about him  it  her
like in a church painting i see this giant hovering over the ground he's wearing a robe and has long flowing hair and he's pointing his finger at something
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
no
oh i am thinking of the o'higgins of redmondstown  general o'higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father colonel granby somerset
i know there's a plan for everyone but sometimes i don't understand what the message is  or what the point is
you have to believe to have faith
you don't believe in anything?
the bible why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles
interpreted by another guy like my father
he doesn't trust you
the play's going to be really good
you're not in a very good mood
the play's in a couple of weeks
oh just not at school
ah  i see  no i'm afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown
yeah 
or anywhere where people might see us
belinda's a very jealous person
so it's like you want to be secret friends
that's it exactly you're reading my mind 
he okay?

i haven't been nice to you
people can see
maybe you inspire me
look asshole  i've been threatened by better than you

okay maybe some of that is true 
you don't know the first thing about being someone's friend 
i don't want to be just your friend 
you don't know what you want 
you don't either take a look at yourself maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you

christ it's a miracle i was even born

what is that? a pencil that writes in ink?
it was marty's turn to be confused huh?
'bike fine point?'
i don't want to hit you in the stomach
you're not gonna hurt me just hit me in the stomach
how many times do i have to explain it to you? we know you're not a fighter you know it i know it but she doesn't know it that's why we gotta make you look like a fighter somebody who'll stand up for her somebody who isn't chicken and you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach
but i've never picked a fight in my entire life
you're not picking a fight you're coming to her rescue maybe we'd better go over the plan again where are you gonna be at 8:55?
i'm going to be at the dance

okay so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me 
why?
why what?
you mean you're gonna 
your line george
oh uh 'hey you get your damn hands off her'  george paused you really think i should swear?
maybe if i used my left
you'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
not a holocaust 
you know damn well that's not what i meant
and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood
yeah explode it up your ass
unfortunately the way things are going you may get your wish you may see the entire annhiliation of the world if not you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources we can already see the air we breathe not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes we'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted in fact all of our energy sources yes you people have a lot to look forward to  a lot to see
yes that's my name who are you young man? are you supposed to be here?
you have a name?
who me?
you're the only mr lewis in this class  if you have something to say say it so the whole class can hear
well yeah i was thinking if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas like what if we run out?
operator
operator listen this is an emergency i have to make this call but i don't have a dime  all i got is a nickel  but you gotta connect me 
sir it only costs a nickel
the cards are now my only livelihood  sometimes i am in luck and then i lay out my money in these trinkets you see  it's property look you and the only way i have found of keeping a little about me when the luck goes against me why my dear my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and i wear paste  do you understand the cards?
what?
oh  right uh madison 3489
i'm sorry there's no answer
operator what's today's date?
march 11th
what year?
good evening one said agents reese   and foley from the nuclear regulatory commition  mind stepping over here?
what am i radioactive or something?
been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?
okay martin you have a good evening now
i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
what?
professor brown it's almost eight thirty  i'm outta here
the power of a million hydrogen bombs  and we get twenty four measly volts it's not fair i've been working on this power converter since 1949 and you'd think in all that time i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy but no thirty three years of dedication and research and all i've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation
that reminds me if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain i've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house  we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater
did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
nope the way i figure it doors are made to be opened see you after school
eight thirty
am or pm?
pro the sun's out
oh right right 
we'll talk about that  four o'clock gives you time to go to bank  three hundred thousand dollars
but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost
catch you later 
but professor 
no marty shemp's molecular structure is completely intact
then where the hell is he?
the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he you see shemp has just become the world's first time traveller i've sent shemp into the future  two minutes into the future to be exact
the future? what are you talking about? where's shemp?
shemp is right here in this roomtwo minutes from now and at exactly 9:02pm we'll catch up to him
a time machine because of that coke?
the plutonium that's what i came over here for professor where did you get that stuff?
exactly two minutes difference  and it's still ticking
have no fear  it will come out well for me
of course shemp is unaware that anything even happened other than his stool suddenly falling over we had to wait two minutes to catch up to him but for shemp the trip was instantaneous
a gold mine?
marty that would alter history
so what? we'd be rich
all i know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money
the future marty the future is everything i built this machine to see the future so i am going to send shemp twentyfour hours into the future you can assist me if you like
professor? professor brown?
professor you time machine works it works it sent me back in time i'm from 1982
he will be simple inebriation is all the young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol something that runs in the family you see he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side came quite a distance to visit me he added his name's lewis
marty
i believe they will deport you
jeez  this is where you used to live huh? you must have been rich
must have been? used to live? i do live here
well there's a mall here now  i mean there will be
a mall?
you've convinced me that you must be who you say you are no living human has ever seen this machine  but why? why even in my twilight years would i remotely consider sending someone back in time?
you didn't professor it was an accident you see what happened 
pardon me?
on second thought there may be some things you'll have to tell me
the power converter
well professor are you sure you want me to tell you? you know changing the course of history and all
i have faced that problem before
how did you know?
professor well not exactly professor you see we don't point it at the sun
4200 rads  that certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age
you answered the door
i told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time nobody's supposed to see you here what if i was a mailman? or a salesman?
what if you lost your keys?
then i would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history don't you understand? the fabric of history is very delicate anything you do could have serious consequences
hey look gimme a break all i did was answer the door how's that gonna change history?
let me put it on a level you can understand you don't belong here you don't know anything about this world you don't know the customs you don't know how to talk how to act  you don't even look like you belong here and if you walked out on the street you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested then there would be questions and where would we come up with the answers?
an atomic bomb
but if they send you away then what is to become of me?
professor be serious would you?
i am serious if we could get you the time machine and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast we could send you back to the future
you're talking crazy an atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds
say where did this guitar come from?
oh  that  i found it in the closet
i don't recall ever seeing it before
well it was there
i know
look it's not a big deal i can fix it all i gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out
where did you get this?
make your mind easy you shall not be left behind i warrant you  do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in berlin  the dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
the test is this monday 15 megatons let's see we need 4200 rads  you'd have to beexactly 800 yards from ground zero you realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous
your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon and that if you were interested in going to the dance saturday she's available
but that's impossible george asked her out he had to i saw him walk her home oh god
my guess is that she turned him down
but why? why would she do that? she's supposed to marry the guy
apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior
in a manner of speaking yes and because of that she's no longer interested in your father
that's all taken care of
look i'm a little worried about this  this whole thing with my mother he admitted to the professor i mean i don't know if i can do it  i mean hitting on my own mother that's pretty heavy
nobody said anything about hitting her you're just going to take a few liberties with her
gentlemen i wish you a good day will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning and tell my man there to send my baggage on to three kings at dresden?
that's exactly what i said i mean a guy and his mother  that's illegal isn't it?
look marty she's not your mother yet and if you don't go through with this she may never be i know it's hard but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant some choices must be made that are difficult nonetheless we must make them besides this may be more than a simple question of your own existence he added the fate of the entire spacetime continuum may rest on your shoulders  marty tried to smile at him
that's just what i needed to hear
it'll be fine marty  you'll be fine good luck he stuck his hand out and marty shook it but there was still a question that was nagging at him
there's no way of knowing
perfect
you didn't?
nope my father's never clenched a fist in his entire life
it was sure nice of uncle sam to put those yardage markers up for us 
thanks for everything pro
when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask?
marty  i know i've repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future butwell those loud bangs on the tape recorderare they
what year is this?
hop in marty  we've got a long drive ahead of us
what do you call this? 
you see i never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952 i decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky anyway experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of cuba caught dr felstien fooling around in the bermuda triangle  that was back in '64
but if you didn't rebuild the time machine how did i go back in time in the first place?
obviously  
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with so don't mention anything about time travel to anyone
what theater was i at?
pretty isn't it?
it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel  that should be work for a hangman
uh yeah gimme a tab
what? 
sweet and what?  maybe you'd better pay for this first
look maybe i'd better talk to dick is he around?
dick? dick who?
now who's being stupid? the guy who runs this place
i run this place 
what happened to dick wilson?
he just lets himself get pushed around all the time people walk all over him and he never fights back never stands up for himself
no self confidence i guess at least you don't take after him
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition
can you imagine your parents in bed together?
no way
me neither i've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married you think yours did?
hell no the way my mom carries on about sex  you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest you shoulda seen her face when i told her we were gonna stay up all night saturday he added always afraid something is going to happen
suzy
hi marty
what did you do to your hair?
hi where's cato?
well he's gone
gone? where?
what?  it doesn't work that way
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him

thirty aught six
you ever had to open it up like that before?
kit kit i've got a question for you

listen i got a lot of respect for her sir  that's about as good a one as i know to tell you
well it's not good enough  just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you kit? guy like you
hi

you have to ask kit he says frog i jump
okay

yeah i can imagine
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you

holly

what for?
oh incidentally my last name is carruthers sounds a little too much like "druthers" doesn't it?
it's okay

doing what?
that's my father i got to run
well i know what my daddy's going to say

i don't care
did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
yeah
is that all there is to it?
gosh what was everybody talking about?
never
you know what i think?
what?
that we should crunch our hands with this stone that way we'd never forget what happened today
but it would hurt
don't call me stupid
i came in the front
how bad off is he?
i can look and see
we better call the doctor listen i'll say how it happened part i saw
are you sure?
but for a time a passing fancy?
listen maybe we ought to tell somebody about this
you said that once already too late now
why?
suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
how you doing?
i'm fine kind of tired
"the kontiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions we had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs i thought at once of suction from the coast which was drawing near and was continually out on the deck and up the mast"
i found a lid it was laying on the ground over there
look at all this junk
how's he doing?
not even that
is he upset?
whatcha looking in there for? we can't afford any of that

i don't know
what'd you put him in there for?
you tired?
yeah
yeah you look tired listen honey when all this is over i'm going to sit down and buy you a big thick steak
i don't want a steak
later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it
how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
hey why're you always walking ahead of me?
don't
anybody ever done that to you before?
no
positive?
yes
i'd like to get out of here
"rumor: pat boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school fulltime and complete his education fact: pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career it's the education that will have to take the back seat"
i don't blame him
that's montana over there
not one
why not? i mean i'm having fun at least i'm not bitching
well i feel kind of like an animal living out here i mean there's no place to bathe and no place to get anything good to eat
everybody loves trout
maybe we should've tried to hop it
it was going too fast
i could've pulled the car up on the tracks slowed it down some
yeah then we'd be stuck here
well maybe the slope here is throwing it off some we ought to find a more flat place
never mind it doesn't matter if i'm worth a damn i'll pick the right direction and if i'm not well i don't care see what i mean?
no
have you not a man whom you value?
what?
nothing i was just running off at the mouth as usual
you know they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you
you smoke pall mall?
boy i had a feeling today was going to be the day helicopter
yeah
have you got a better idea?
i just don't want to go
course it's too bad about your dad

rawhide tells me dr lizardo escaped
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces
buckaroo  what the sam hill
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
carefuldon't make noise and don't touch me  i'm hotter than flapjacks

arachtoids  from planet ten
planet 10?
i'm starvingsomebody help
got a half a tuna sandwich
then what?
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
dr lizardo's a raving lunatic perfect tommy a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours
have you warned professor hikita?
the professor and dr emilio lizardo were actually the first to discover the eighth dimension  almost fifty years ago  before buckaroo's parents even knew each other  but there was trouble a rocket catapult failed and dr lizardo got sucked half in half outwhen they hauled him back he wasn't the same guy  his hair was orange
and his soul black as the ace of spades
go back to the bus and reroute the call
that's me i've been ionized but i'm okay i'm switching on the homing beacon mark two minute intervals
buckaroo somebody shanghaied the professor
what crate?
i think i'm on to something you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne
you okay?
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
you're a welcome sight
apache?
arachtoid
we will old fried we will
anybody we know?
buckaroo you got a minute?
not really  this is pretty important
everybody ready?  how do we look?  do we look okay?
hey any lock can be picked  so what's he up to?
running a little late buckaroo
it is only too possible  love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last
let her out in my custody
planet 10?  the same planet 10 you postulated beyond pluto perfect tommy?  the invisible body?
it wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here  it wasn't to talk to the head honcho
buckaroo sorry

dead  damnit
it's whorfin buckaroo  line 3
all accounted for?  where's penny?
these antidote filters the professor's whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday as arachtoidal creatures they won't be pretty nothing personal john parker  but just rememberif we fail tonight there's no tomorrow
what is this thing?  a fighter?
i agree; but god put us on earth to take that risk
we're going down  onto the runway
i lack the authority buckaroo banzai
does this thing have guns john parker?
pull up  we did it  holy shit we did it  pull up
now buckaroo banzai?
and there's a twohundreddollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield
they're arachtoids buckaroo from planet 10
where there was some kinda giant crash landing a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up  and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for
but he wasn't the real doctor lizardojust this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the eighth dimension when prof hikita's lab exploded
where're you goin'?
a man may need to do that and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws
and they got penny  look
they're armed for bear buckaroo  check out those radiation levels
got a casualty list?
just their side  what're we gonna do with these people?  they're illegal aliens the way i figure been here forty years you could throw the book at 'em
raise your handwhere?
this is so embarrassing
somebody get her a mike? can we manage that?  and a spotlight  what's your name?
did you say"peggy"?
nobody's a nobody  why're you crying?  what's wrong?
did i say anything was wrong? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69 okay? i'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town i can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record  he offered to set me up for life and like a fool well i
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
he offered you money?
this song's for peggy  and all you others out there a little down on your luck
let me go let me go you creeps
what're you doing here? why're you looking at me like that?
i guess 'cause you remind me of someone i once knew long ago before any of this craziness
go away  let me rot?
who were you really trying to kill last night?
you  like the papers all say
was she pretty?
who?
were you a fireman?  that how you knew how to rig the apartment?
how so?
the girl i remind you of
she was the queen of the netherlands
i'd turn around but i'm afraid you'd strangle me
the netherlands  whew that's a long way from wyoming
wyoming? not cody by any chance?
no  laramie  except i was born in cody how did you know that?  oh right sure i forgot: you know everything

she must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you
she was killed penny
oh my

where's my damn ammo?  nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here
it is my only object
how did she die?  i wanna know
you don't wanna know
yes i do  gimme a chance  i'm stronger than you think
she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night
hanoi shan?  the guy in your comic books  boss of the world crime league?  supreme commander of the legion of death?  the pivot of mystery himself?  you're putting me on  he's a cartoon character
never
i gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelingsi've got mixed emotionsi don't know if i can handle this  oh boy
i gotta go  we're on borrowed time
go where?  where're you going?
please penny  you just gotta trust me now  okay?  and don't panic because it's gonna be all right

i'm not worth it buckaroo forget me
world watch one  direct incoming transmission
hello mr president  how's my favorite patient?  any tenderness?
not too terrific sir  i apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space and it looks like the earth's caught in a crossfire
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
hit smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war mr president
a what?
a thermonuclear holocaust sir  these creatures from planet 10 are ready to exploit sovietamerican tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth sir if necessary
buckaroo come inover  how does this damn thing work?  can anybody figure this lighter out?
no sir  i think the flint
what's happening with my call to sac?
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command  they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed
jammed? by who? whom by?
possible atmospheric condition sirsolar  it's unusual but no cause for alarm  intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem
how long you been riding with buckaroo reno?
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
nigh on ten years  been through a lotta scrapes together
what'd you do before?  can i ask?
government work  had my own think tank  got tired of thinkingwanted some action  seen plenty of it too  so will you if you stick around
where's buckaroo?  is he alive?
what's his problem?
perfect tommy's just threatened by smart women  can you play that thing?
better see what's keepin' the boss reno

deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me  if i do not know it i am innocent
pictures don't lie

barton
my father was  he gave me many lessons about fire  now it's my friend

i want to know
barton honestly only the last couple
hah
if i close m'eyes i can almost smell the live oak
this'll sometimes help
m'honey pretends to be impatient with me barton but she'll put up with anything

and what would that be son?
i don't know exactly but i do know what you're doing with that drink you're cutting yourself off from your gift and from me and audrey and from your fellow man and from everything your art is about
will we always leave it at this?
no son thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out no i'm usin' it to build somethin'
what's that?
i'll jus' walk on down to the pacific and from there i'll improvise

i'm a writer ted okum said you're producing this wallace beery picture i'm working on
what?  ted okum doesn't know shit they've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year what ted okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl
don't worry about it it's just a b picture i bring it in on budget they'll book it without even screening it life is too short
but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script see something by the end of the week
look you're confused? you need guidance? talk to another writer
always my dear one never any further  love is a child to be pacified with trifles  a full diet can only kill it
well i
getting started christ jesus started?  you mean you don't have anything?
what do you think this is? hamlet? gone with the wind? ruggles of red gap? it's a goddamn b picture big men in tights you know the drill
i'm afraid i don't really understand that genre maybe that's the prob

well i've talked to bill mayhew
a souse
you don't understand he's in pain because he can't write
souse souse he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week
but i thought no one cared about this picture
i know better than you do  love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away
i don't understand
are you deaf he likes you he's taken an interest what the hell did you say to him?
i can't write anything by tomorrow
who said write? jesus jack can't read  you gotta tell it to himtell him something for chrissake
i thought you were going to join us jesus garland you left me alone with those people
we have to talk a little business i've just been on the phone to los angeles  barton capitol pictures wants to put you under contract they've offered you a thousand dollars a week i think i can get them to go as high as two
to do what?
what do you do far a living?
to see pap
yes generally to see pap however point number two: a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays
our abstinence makes our love immortal  if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more  but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
i don't know garland; my place is here right now i feel i'm on the brink of success
what is it barton? are you okay?
i'm fine garland but i have to talk with you
go ahead son
it's about what i'm writing garland it's really i think it's really big
very important garland i just thought you should know that whatever happens
that's fine
have you read the bible garland?
barton is everything okay?
neighbor i'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink
let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew
that's all right really thank you
 you got a glass? it's the least i can do
what kind of work do you do barton if you don't mind my asking?
well i'm a writer actually
in spite of what you might think from tonight i'm pretty good at it
that's okay charlie i'm a playwright my shows've only played new york last one got a hell of a writeup in the herald i guess that's why they wanted me here
hell why not? everyone wants quality what kind of venue that is to say thematically uh
caught me trying to be fancy yeah that's it bart
well that's a good question strange as it may seem charlie i guess i write about people like you the average working stiff the common man
yeah i guess that's tragedy right there
my husband has convinced me of the contrary
hell no jesus i'm the kind of guy i'll let you know if i'm bored i find it all pretty damned interesting i'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view
and look i'm sorry as hell about the interruption too much revelry late at night you forget there are other people in the world
howdy neighbor
charlie how are you
oh yeah an ear infection chronic thing  goes away for a while but it always comes back gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus don't worry it's not contagious
ah doctors what's he gonna tell me?  can't trade my head in for a new one
thanks i'd invite you over to my place but it's a goddamn mess you married bart?
nope
got a sweetheart?
my folks live in brooklyn with my uncle
shall i tell you something  i believed what was called love came after the union  and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead  and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it
this must be boring you
not at all it's damned interesting
all right now when i say "ready wrestle"  you try and pin me and i try and pin you that's the whole game got it?
yeah okay
it's okay it's okay
i hope these are your shoes
hi charlie
because that would mean they gave you mine
jesus what a day i've had ever had one of those days?
jesus what a day felt like i couldn't've sold ice water in the sahara jesus okay so you don't want insurance so okay that's your loss but god people can be rude feel like i have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my
god you're just like him just keep me locked away in the dark so i can't experience anything for myself
you can't kill me  you're not a cop just fireman with a gun  i bet you never shot anybody in your life
without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love inexpressible love  god of nature bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter  divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes
well my pleasure i could use a little lift myself
did i say rude? people can be goddamn cruel especially some of their housewives okay so i've got a weight problem that's my cross to bear i dunno
well it's it's a defense mechanism
how did you know about that?
ah you'll lick this picture business believe me you've got a head on your shoulders what is it they say? where there's a head there's a hope?
and there's hope for you too charlie tomorrow i bet you sell a halfdozen policies
thanks brother but the fact is i gotta pull up stakes temporarily
your room does that too?
i guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper
i guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy
well
well it's pathetic isn't it? i mean to a guy from new york
what do you mean?
this kind of heat it's pathetic
well i guess you pick your poison
so they say
don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye
can i come in?
barton are you all right?
no can i come in?
as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you  but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much
why don't we go to your room
will you stay with me till they get here?
hold on stop take a deep breath tell me what happened
hold on i said hold on so hold on
yeah
jesus they can tell that
they gotta believe me charlie they gotta have mercy
uhhuh where's audrey?
jesus you're leaving
jesus charlie i
my lady cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one  her life was passed in a series of crackbrained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me  we would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes  one day i was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth  she suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me:
everything's okay believe me i know it's rough mentally but everything's taken care of
it's more than i've got

i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set
when did you start drinking again?
there's no smoking in this building

i want you in dr gardner's office at nine o'clock  you're out of control curran
we got a call from berkeley pd there was a killing  a professor icepick  in his bed  multiple stab wounds  1977

you're on leave man  you're on psycho leave  i'm talking to a possible whacko here
the boat blew  there was a leak in the gas line  there were two previous repairs  there was a fivemil policy on both of 'em  a real heavy investigation  zilch gooseegg  it was an accident
i can get my butt kicked for this you're not supposed to be in here
were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden?
hey that's dr gardner isn't it?
how are you nick?
i'm fine  come on beth  you know i'm fine  how the hell long do i have to keep doing this?
as long as internal affairs wants you to i suppose  sit down nick
it's bullshit  you know it is
so  how are things?
how is your  personal life?
how about the booze?
it's been three months
how about the coke?
i don't care a fig for captain best; he dances prettily to be sure and is a pleasant rattle of a man  he looks well in his regimentals too; and if he chose to ask me to dance how could i refuse him?
no
no?
how's not smoking?
it's fucked  now will you please tell ia that i'm just you average healthy totally fuckedup cop and let me get out of here?
yes
you okay?
yeah
what are you doing here?
babysitting  rookie cop
what was she like?
but you refused me dorothy
who?
catherine tramell
we were in some of the same classes
i need a cigarette
what are you talking about nick  what's wrong with you?
it's a confidential psychiatric record it'd be illegal she backs into a wall  she looks very scared he comes very close to her  puts an arm behind her to the wall
it's internal affairs isn't it?
no nick please 
who?
i don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything  we went to bed  what was it?  ten or fifteen times?  it wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations
oh  i can dance with you any day and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner  besides roderick captain best's a man and you are only a boy and you haven't a guinea in the world
sometimes i really hate you
you did it for me
it's the least i could do considering i got you into this mess with those reports
how do you know catherine tramell saw my reports?
she knows stuff about me that only you know
she must really be something  from a clinical point of view
what was she like in school?
beth  i didn't mean what i said about 
what is your problem?  i'm trying to help you  why won't you let me help you?
i don't need any help
if ever i meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two  i'll fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is
what is this interest you've got in her?
my interest is in you not in her she seduces people she manipulates 
i thought you hardly know her
what do you want nick?
she told you didn't she?
what did she tell me beth?
i did dye my hair  it didn't have anything to do with her  i was a redhead for a while too
did you know noah goldstein?
i had him in two classes
she's really sick you know  don't you know what she's doing?  she knows i went to berkeley  she knows i knew noah  she makes up that story about me  she's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her
suppose now roderick you who are such a hero was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side
she didn't hand you to me  she doesn't even know who you are she told me about lisa henderson
why did you change your name?
you should do something about this lock
what are you doing here?
put your fucking hands up  don't move
don't  i know about your husband  you still like girls beth?
i'm de
how long were you dating him?
how long were you having sex with him?
about a year and a half
i'd draw my sword and cut my way through them
were you with him last night?
yes
did you leave the club with him?
yes
did you go home with him?
no  we had a drink at the club we left together  i came here he went home

do you always keep old newspapers around?
what with me on the pillion?  would you kill poor me?
do you have a cigarette?
i don't smoke
yes you do
i thought you were out of cigarettes
i told you  i quit
what's your new book about?
did i miss something?
i told them you wouldn't want to hide
but you said you liked men to use their hands
writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him
well then i'll tell you what i'd do  i'd jump daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us
you like playing games don't you?
how did you feel when he died?
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died  that day at the beach
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game
but you didn't hurt 
no
because you didn't love him 
even though you were fucking him
sure
i'm tired
where's your partner?
monster  your father was a tailor and you are always thinking of the shop  but i'll have my revenge i will  roddy will you see me insulted?
if i were guilty and if i wanted to beat that machine it wouldn't be tiring  it wouldn't be tiring at all
why not?
i passed
how do you know all this stuff about me?
you know all about me
i don't know anything that isn't police business
am i disturbing you?
would you like a drink?  i was just going to have one
i'd like to ask you a few more questions
you tell me
i am at your service mr cosgrove how much do you wish to spend?
it was an accident  they got in the line of fire
four shootings in five years  all accidents
tell me about professor goldstein
there's a name from the past
noah was my counselor in my freshman year  that's probably where i got the idea for the icepick  for my book funny how the subconscious works  hazel is my friend
she wiped out her whole family
yes  she's helped me understand homicidal impulse
didn't you study it in school?
what happened nick?  did you get sucked into it? did you like it too much?
i didn't
as much as possible
how exactly did you hear?
i have attorneys  they have friends  i have friends  money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends
i don't know about that i don't have any money i don't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend
i wasn't talking about real friends why doesn't gus like me
i like you
do you?
you're not easy to figure  i'm just very good at figuring
don't get too cocky
why not?
you can make a mistake
as much as possible?
jack daniel's okay?  it's gonna have to be
fine
ice?
what did you pay nilsen?
what if i asked you not to call me shooter?
what if i call you nicky?
my wife used to call me that
cheers  my friends call me catherine
what did bobby vasquez used to call you?
bitch mostly but he meant it affectionately  you don't have any coke do you?  i love coke and jack daniel's
yes for i wish to entertain splendidly
there's pepsi in the fridge
say  "what do you want from me catherine?"
aren't you going to thank me?
what's it about?
why does he do it?
when did you write it?
you mean did i write it before my parents died?
yes
you're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave  are you?
no
all the same you must name an amount
good  i'd miss you  you can get into trouble though you're not really a cop anymore
i'll risk it
why take the risk?
how's your new book?
i'm leaving the house around midnight  in case you're going to follow me  i'm going down to johnny's club
maybe she saw something she didn't see before
did you think it was so special?
what did you think?
how about roxy?  is she a fuck to the century too?
how's your shoulder?
last month the duke of suffolk spent no more
fine  how's your back?
are you kidding?  you think this is my idea of morningafter conversation?
i thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty
you shouldn't play this game
you're in over your head
i should have known  i came into the house when you were down on the beach  she looked at me so strangely  she left right after you  i shouldn't have let her watch us she wanted to watch me all the time  she tried to kill you didn't she?
did you like her to watch?
do you think i told her to kill you?
no
it's ok  it's ok
and to be sure i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister lord west whose acquaintance i made as i had so many others at the gaming table
do you think she killed johnny boz?
for what to set me up?  she loved me she wouldn't frame me
maybe she got jealous of johnny boz too
i thought you didn't do adolescent secrets
no
no?
you won't believe me
i paid him $50000 in cash for your psychiatric file
when?
about three months before i met you
do you happen to know gustavus adolphus the thirteenth earl of crabs?
i'd read about your shootings in the papers  i decided to write a book about a detective  i wanted to know my character
you paid $50000 for your character?
i would've paid more  i wanted to know everything about you  then you came down here after johnny got killed it gave me a chance to get to know my character better
what about the other night what about last night?  was that to get to know your character?
do you believe me?
i don't know
what did he say?
he asked if i had an icepick in me yet
can i talk to you a minute?
you like to hang out with murderers or what?  did you know roxy 
by name only
i just thought i'd surprise you  what's the matter?
i found lisa henderson
you're not going to tell me what she's doing  i thought we weren't playing games anymore
you still think i kill people don't you?
no
how'd you get in here?
i decided to give you one more chance  i missed you
you didn't not see me long enough to miss me
did you miss me?
no

the answer is no  i didn't kill him
do you use drugs ms tramell?
what kind of drugs?
in the beginning  then i got to like what he did for me
in so far as i can tell these things  no  i believe the chevalier won the money fairly

what was the weapon?
38 revolver  never recovered

the king has determined to send the chevalier out of the country
i hope i helped you out

be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong  have you lost much?
i don't give a flyin' chili bean fart about aids
you oughta use a rubber pop  you really should
what in the hell for?  you think i'm gettin' any at my age?  i don't like bluehaired women  i don't like 'em
you don't like punk rockers?

i'm not afraid of her
why the hell not?
i don't know  i'm just not
it doesn't make sense  she didn't know me three months ago
you all right pop?  you want me to drive you?
let her go  let her go
that fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundredpound bill which was in the pocketbook that the fellow took from me
in that little pissant car of yours? hell no  i ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement  i'm gettin' me a full pension and a real goldplate seiko watch
come on i'll drive you in this thing
catherine says you don't like her
you know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
i don't believe it
why not?
i don't understand what the hell's going on here pop
i'm not sure anymore she did it
so nilsen had a report on her  so what  you don't know what the hell was in it?
catherine told me what was in it
i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap
if she's telling  you the truth
don't you get it gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine  she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen
how did she know nilsen knew about it  if it happened?
she'd have to be nuttier than a twentypound christmas fruitcake she's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers  your girlfriend is
she's a writer  it's part of what she does
goddamn writers  all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes  there's gotta be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened
i know what happened  catherine told me what happened
where the hell you goin'?
i'm going with you
maybe the maid did it
but i shouldn't like to put you to such trouble mister?
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch
maybe it's for oldtime's sake
sometimes i think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with internal affairs
he ain't that way  he's got heart
you look like dogshit
you're already gettin' psychological input son
homicide
what do you want?
when was the last time you saw john boz?
were you with him last night?
as you have been robbed of your purse may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
what was the motive?
he left the club with his girlfriend about midnight  that's the last time anybody saw him
keep your three o'clock
do you want me to work the case phil or do you want me to 
are you kidding me?
i love it  she's got a hundred million bucks  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars  and she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads
so what do we do  nothing?
what is all this "nick" stuff  nick would you like a cigarette nick can you give me a ride
she didn't ask me for the ride she asked anybody
you sure?
how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies  in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality  to the lady's question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum
now what?
what now what? now nothing  she passed the polygraph  that's it
she knew she could beat it  that's why she asked to take it
how the fuck do you know?  what is it with you and this broad anyway?
come on phil  you're not gonna let this slide  what about her parents?  what about what else she's published?  at least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing reallife coincidence
her parents died in an accident i don't care what else she's written  what are you  a book critic?
how did they die?  was there an investigation?
fuck you phil
gus  go over to berkeley harrigan  find out what else she's published  andrews  get the files on her parents' accident carbon beth on everything  i want some psychological input on this andrews and harrigan go; nick is left there with gus
i'll ask you once nick  for the record did you kill him?
i have good news for you mr cosgrove  the firm of bracegirdle and chatwick in the city of london are prepared to lend you 20000 pounds pledged against your interest in the edric mines  they will redeem the encumbrances against the property which amount to some 10000 pounds and take a twenty year working lease on the mines they will lend you the 20000 pounds against the lease income which they will apply to the loan as it comes in and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance
ia's going to talk to you more about nilsen  they're handling the investigation we're not stay in touch with dr gardner it'll help on the evaluation
she killed him
beth?  now you've got beth killing people?
catherine tramell  it's part of her game
first you've got her buying your file  now you've got her killing nilsen  forget her willya?  go someplace  sit in the sun  get away from this goddamn fog  get her out of your system
tell me again  i want to hear you say it again
it was an accident
you're driving around north beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way 
i don't think she meant to go off the hill do you?
you knew her didn't you?
mr newcombe i have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed
gus and i talked to her at tramell's house  all we did was write her name down
i told you to stay away from tramell
she's a suspect
on what basis?
she's got enough money to burn this whole department down
she was the last person seen with the guy  i'll take the responsibility
we know you're not stupid ms tramell
we're sorry to disturb you we'd like to ask you some 
why do you think he's dead?
who are you?
considering your financial circumstances mr cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you  i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity but obviously if you would reject this offer i shall keep trying to find a better one
how old was she when this happened?
anderson  jack w donald m  i'm sorry  no lisa
did you check all four years?
yes i did
no lisa anderson detective
can there be some mistake?
he died  about five or six years ago
my name is jean michel basquiat have you heard of me?
no should i have?
i'm a painter too
i am prepared to accept the terms mr newcombe
is this finished yet?
i don't know
when's your show?
not sure how was yours?
what do you think?
i like the one with the dragon's heads a lot but the black one's filled up with too many heads  i'd take some of them out  i think you're painting too fast i wouldn't put in so many heads let it breathe a bit
it's always how you would do it this is my version
you're right it's your version you should come over to the studio sometime
why so you could humiliate me?
naa
there are a few other points we should discuss  the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature
let's get out of here
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan i painted it after joseph beuys died a rebirth painting i felt like he could've painted it or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me the chinese calligraphers used to change their name midcareer so they could start over as someone else
do you ever get sick of it?
no it's one of the few times i feel good i used to have to go to work and cook every day that i got sick of
what about the shit they write?
you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark i read that the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly that's your enemy not your audience your audience hasn't even been born yet it's a lie that art is popular the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting and andy's one of them
i haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out
nixon lives in saddle river new york
saddle river's in new jersey
saddle river new york
hi i'm honey
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  are you serious?
it's in new jersey
new york
i think it's in new jersey
it's in new york
you wanna buy some ignorant art? ten bucks
ohhh that's new that sounds good
ten bucks apiece
i can give you five you didn't do very much to these
andy man thanks for coming i'd like to paint your jacket
jean michel this is mary boone she's got the great new gallery
may i be quite frank with you?
i wish they'd quit writing this shit about me

yes of course
piss painting?
i wanted to make a few more of these frank's been drinking this mexican beer it makes a good green
how come you're not peeing on them yourself?
that was my favorite part
i don't even have any friends anymore besides you and everyone says "warhol? that deathwarmed over person on drugs? he's just using you"
gee you shouldn't take it so seriously jean that's why you can't stop taking drugs you always think people don't like you everyone likes you
bruno called in europe people are saying you're gonna die from drugs they think they can cash in on your death
after the show we should take a nice long vacation maybe go to hawaii that's what i'm gonna do i'm going to give up painting and start playing music again i wanna sing
who is it?
annina nosei
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital
is jean michel here?
these are great
aren't they?
how much for these five?
i'm interested in showing jean's work
no
i'd love to see some more of your work where's your studio?

no he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world he said the eddie murphy
good night papa
or rather do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
are those the only two possibilities?  you wanna french fry?
ok one last thing is there any anger in you? any anger in your work?
should there be?

that's great
would you check out my studio some time?
i made sir william cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play table  one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth
what's your name man?
they call me steve but i prefer shenge
hi
hi
i've seen you before i like your paintings a lot your hair was different
you like your dad's paintings?
some of them
see you later
how can i ever thank you?
come on
indeed you are right sir  look at me  marriage has added forty years to my life  i am dying a wornout cripple at the age of fifty  when i took off lady cosgrove there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself  fool that i was i had enough with my pensions perfect freedom the best society in europe  and i gave up all these and married and was miserable  take a warning from me mr roderick and stick to the trumps  do anything but marry
wanna mac?
no i'd like the scarf

i don't eat junk food
oh i didn't know i'll take you to the best restaurant in town  you'll miss a great meal and i'll keep the scarf anyway what's your name?
you're a fast mover
that's a beautiful name french?
what? wait a minute talk to me
you see? you have someone to live for
no i don't i'm alone we all are especially here the world's unjust the respect fools get the disrespect i get
would you have me spend my life all alone?
what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you just for making this call one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world" think about it feel it
what? what do you want?
you heard of albert milo i made that niggah i'm rene ricard didn't you read "not about albert milo?" i know who to hype baby i'm gonna make you a star
can you put me in the ring with him?
i can put you in the ring with him even book the dates  but those big boys know how to fight they could make you look real sissy  i was looking at that painting upstairs it's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything  so what's your real name? 'samo?'
uh huhh band practice?  it's benny he wants to know why you're not at band practice?
tony bennett what do you mean?
singing on stage and painting in your spare time
i didn't know tony bennett painted
so keep painting
now i like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure  why don'tchya put my money on the dresser
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
yes boss  if you're so smart why are you here with me in this basement?
you're news i want the scoop i write it down when i speak no one believes me but when i write it down people know it's true  there's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important you know?
so what?
so shut up and keep painting
what time is it?
that one's for you
thanks i'll take it tonight
i'll make you another one
hey rene
jean could you get me a phillips screwdriver?
the milkmaid's daughter?
a what?
a phillips head from the toolbox
'phillips head' right?
you don't have any
jean? hold this please  you'll get there but it's good to have something to fall back on that's why i became an electrician it pays the rent y'know i'm an artist too
i didn't know
ok goodbye
pipe down lech let him order
you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you're not such a good waitress you get out too
i just don't think you're being fair
sir william cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches  he was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live i don't know how many years  if cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady?  but my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account
i need this?
yo jean this is ramellzee
yo you know why rammellzee's here don't you?
uhoh
man i was up on him years ago on the irt
you're selling and ending the culture not one bit of information only to get the money and growl with the power man
mr wayne  something wrong?
it's cold
it's vichyssoise sir
i suppose you feel better now sir
good evening mr james have you done with my lady?
sorry alfred i have to get to the plaza  you heard penguin he was practically begging me to show
which is why i hoped you'd snub him
'fraid i can't  there's been a kidnapping  tell selina  ms kyle  that some business came up  no tell her some major deal fell through she'll feel sorry  no no here's what to do just tell her  let her know that i  not in a dumb "be my girlfriend way" but 
i will relay the message
selina  more facets than vicki huh?  funny but sort of mysterious
"affair"  yes maybe  if she 
mr wayne  a reminder:  tonight is that loathsome party hosted by that odious mr shreck  may we rsvp in the resoundingly negative?
i'm tempted but  well  it is an occasion for celebration and  umm  selina will probably be there 
ah  "who" may i ask are you going "as"?
i guess this mean we won
i beg your pardon?
well  come what may merry christmas mr wayne
where's the fire?
how could you?  i'm a woman
as i was saying:  i'm a woman and can't be taken for granted  are you listening you batman you?
hanging on every word
a "heman"?  sure  they shine that beacon in the sky then wonder what hole i crawl out of
wow a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights but explain me  if you're so down on "them" out there why bust your batbuns to protect 'em?
i can't sleep either lately  a little link between us  but bottom line baby you live to preserve the peace and i'm dying to disturb it  that could put a strain on our relationship
hey stud:  i thought we had something together
a kiss under the misteltoe mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it 
come come sir  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
you're the second man who killed me this week  but hey no prob  i've got seven lives left
i tried to grab you  save you 
first you're gonna shut up  then you're gonna turn yourself in
don't be naive  the law doesn't apply to people like him  or us 
admiring your handiwork?
touring the riot scene  gravely assessing the devastation upstanding mayor stuff
you're not the mayor
once you were their freak now these clowns do your bidding must feel pretty good
better than you know batboy
what're you really after?
gentlemen see this amiable youth he has been troubled by religious scruples and has flown for refuge to my chaplin mr hunt who has asked for advise from my wife lady cosgrove and between them both they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith  did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
ah the direct approach  i admire that in a man with a mask  but you don't really think you'll ever win playing it your way ?
i think you're jealous that i'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask
we've met
sorry  i mistook me for somebody else
you mean mistook <u>me</u>?
didn't i say that?
you don't seem like the type who does business with mr shreck
no  and you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him
well that's a  long story 
well i could  free up some time
faith sir if i want to learn good principles it's surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you?
i'm listed
pouring myself into my work
i ah  didn't catch your last name
selina  hi  didn't mean to 
scare me?  no actually i was just scaring myself 
i don't see how  anyway it's a treat to find you out in the world away from ebeneezer shreck
the news these days  weird people looking to superheroes for their peace of mind and blaming their problems on supervillains  instead of themselves or their spouses at least
and it's not even accurate  i mean "batman blows it"?  the guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage
you're not coming to that are you?  "the relighting of the tree" thing?
i wouldn't be caught dead  no it's probably how i would be caught  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait 
well if my intentions are what you think they are  if i do wish to step into your shoes what then?  i have no other intentions than you had yourself  lady cosgrove's wealth may be great but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition  i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if i win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
you almost sound enthusiastic
i detest violence but  christmas complacency can be a downer too
you've got a dark side selina kyle
no darker than yours bruce
well i'm braver at night if that's what you mean
 maybe i'll watch it on tv
"we"?  you and
 and me  no that's be me and me  is that what i said?
i'm sure he's wonderful company and all but  doesn't the gold plated bachelor bit get a little  stale?
somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome i'd suppose
is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as i am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
executive assistant  secretary  girlfriend?
had one  didn't work
what went wrong?  hang on i think i know  you kept things from her
nope i told her everything
and the truth frightened her?
well  how can i put this there were two truths  and she had trouble reconciling them because <u>i</u> had trouble reconciling them  vicki said
"vicki"  iceskater or stewardess?
photojournalist
well?  was "vicki" right?  about your difficulty with duality?
it's the socalled "normal" guys who always let you down  sickos never scare me  at least they're commited
it's an outcall service run out of an apartment  i don't meet the other girls  aren't you gonna get undressed?
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight?
i ah  never fool around on the first date
nor i on the second
sorry about yesterday  some big deal came together no fell through and 
's'okay i had to go home feed my cat
there's a big comfy california king over in bedding  what say we 
y'mean take off our costumes?
guess i'm sick of wearing masks 
same here  so why'd you come tonight?
now don't give me a killingmax won'tsolveanything speech because it will  aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  when he should be six feet under?
jesus selina you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury i mean just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps  why man i have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation  who knows how long i may keep you waiting
a kiss under the mistletoe mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it 
 what do we do?
hmm  primitive ventilation
damn those carny bolsheviks the other night throwing bricks at my windows 
no  no glass on the inside
i'd offer you coffee but my assistant is using her vacation time
if my life has had any meaning that's the meaning
max i'm gonna fight you on this the mayor and i have already spoken and we see eye to eye here  so 
mayors come and go  and heirs tire easily  really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with muhammed shreck
not compared to that "cobblepot" person you're promoting
sir let those laugh that win
scared of oswald are you?  why if his parents hadn't eighty sixed him you two might've been roomies at prep school
"oswald" is linked to the red triangle gang  i can't prove it but we both know it's true
what happened?
ingenious costume  let me guess  trustfund goodygoody?
course you're feeling fine  you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city
i am the light of this city  <u>and</u> i am its mean twisted soul  does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
it does to me
i don't know what you want but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss  money jewels a very big ball of string
your blood max
my blood?  i  i gave at the office
charming schuvaloff
let's make a deal  <u>other</u> than my blood what can i off
sorry max  a die for a die
selina  selina kyle?  you're fired  and bruce  bruce wayne why are you dressed up as batman?
he <u>is</u> batman you moron
you killed me batman killed me penguin killed me  three lives down  got enough bullets to finish me off?
i'll warm ya  i got hot mitts 
down oswald  we have to talk  you see we've got something in common
appetite for destruction? contempt for the czars of fashion? wait don't tell me  naked sexual charisma?
batman  the thorn in both our sides the fly in our ointment
are you perchance a registered voter?  i'm also a mayoral prospect
blackeyed sczortarska
i have but one pet cause today: ban the bat
we're gonna disassemble his spiffy old batmobile then reassemble it as an hbomb on wheels  capiche? yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor
y'mean frame him?
thanks  jeez  not used to this manwoman catmouse business generally the babes flock to me i tell 'em take a number
he napalmed my arm  he knocked me off a building just when i was starting to feel good about myself i want to play an integral part in his degradation
well a plan <u>is</u> forming  a vicious one involving the loss of innocent life 
let's consummate our fiendish union
i wouldn't touch you to scratch you
i oughta have you spayed  you sent out all the signals
me domesticated?  by you?  i doubt it  you repulsive awful <u>penguin</u>
dark valdez
son
i  it was terrible i leaned over and accidentally knocked her out 
she jumped  she'd been depressed
yes  <u>yes</u>  boyfriend trouble ?
you buy this "blurry" business?
ten nine
the christmas eve of destruction  
 eight seven
silent night violent night
well um funny thing your penguins they're not responding to the launch command  fact they're kind of turned around now like someone jammed our signal
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
but who could've  no don't say it
actually this is all just a bad dream  you're home in bed heavily sedated resting comfortably and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering tragic irony or poetic justice? you tell me
my god  it's true  the penguin man of the sewers  please don't h
what is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
no just give you a splitting headache
most of all i want to find out who i am  by finding my parents learning my "human" name  simple stuff that the good people of gotham take for granted
yawn  that coulda come from anywhere
what about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in gotham?
a lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference  by the way how's fred adkins your old partner?
you know what mr  penguinsir? i think perhaps i could help orchestrate a little welcomehome scenario for you  and once we're both back home perhaps we can help each other out 
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
don't look oswald  it's a surprise
bu  wh  i  i mean 
yes adulation is a cross to bear god knows <u>i</u> know  but someone's got to supplant our standingin thewayofprogress mayor and don't deny it mr cobblepot you've got the magic
wonder if it's worth my time
we need signatures  to overturn the ballot  i can supply those oswald
i could teach her my "french flipper" trick
oswald:  we need one more thing
a platform?  lemme see  stop global warming  start global cooling  make the world a colder place  <u>frigid</u> 
that's fine oswald  but to get the mayor recalled we still need a catalyst a trigger an incident like the reichstag fire the gulf of tonkin
precisely  but they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that i've provided  that shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state
and he doesn't care about me?
i got my own  <u>quest</u> to pursue up here  it's crucial i not get sidetracked with some silly 
sidetracked?  oswald this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded 
reclaim my birthright y'mean?
he didn't even lose a limb an eyeball  bladder control 
max  relax  josh and jen'll put a spin on this  we'll talk it over tonight at your costume par
you're coming with me you great white dope  to die way down in the sewer
not chip  please  penguin  if you have one iota of human feeling you'll take me instead
i don't  so no
i'm the one you want  penguin please  ask yourself:  isn't it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  isn't it max not chip whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
working late?  i'm touched
he is only curious to know who you are
why how industrious  and how did you open protected files may i ask?
big giant <u>capacitor</u>  and that instead of generating power it'll sort of be    <u>sucking</u> power from gotham city and storing it  stockpiling it sort of?  which unless i'm being dense is a novel approach i'd say
 where did curiosity get the cat?
i'm no cat  i'm just an assistant a <u>secretary</u> 
and a very very good one
it's our secret  honest  how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
okay go ahead  intimidate me bully me if it makes you feel big  i mean it's not like you can just kill me

i damn well better be  in fact i want you to phone those goniffs over at gotham insurance and tell them 
how long has it been uncle alfred?
joanna and i were in love in london but when i realized our age difference was too extreme 
uncle alfred left for america  much to my mother's dismay 
you certainly will not
i'm sorry uncle i came to tuck you in  and
i guess they don't have fax machines on elephants
i have been trying to reach wilfred with no success  as one grows older one yearns for family
it's good to see you again uncle i've missed you
i'm sorry  i was too late
he loves me as i love you
too late for what dear child?
i came to give you your freedom a chance to live the life you choose the same gift you gave me
find my brother wilfred  give him this  i have duties he must fulfill in my stead  only family can be trusted
what is it?
uncle alfred?
in spirit only i'm afraid
he's overeager impulsive  i can't trust him not to get hurt
perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone
don't tell me you're on his side again
i must have dozed off  my sincerest apologies sir
will he wish to know the details of this night?
you have?
well i hope you'll stay with us
oh but sir  so much goes on
congratulations on your apprehension of mr freeze  batman monopolized the evening news
is there something wrong sir?
alfred am i pigheaded?  is it always my way or the highway?
but i can't can i?
i am as well as can be expected
alfred i know you're sick  i can get you the best doctors
have you ever regretted your life working here alfred?
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him
attending to heroes?  no sir  my only regret is that i was never able to be out there with you
alfred if i've never told youi just want to say
i've spent my whole life trying to beat back death  what good are all my heroics now if i can't save you?
i love you old man
alfred old friend i could use your help right now
it's good to see you
what seems to be the problem?
women
that sir does not compute
first ivy had an intoxicating effect on both dick and me  tonight my feelings spread to someone else
don't like 'em don't eat 'em don't make no damn difference to me
specify please
pamela isley  i was so attracted to her i couldn't reason clearly  i still can't  she used to work for wayne enterprises  find a file
advanced botany  dna splicing recombinant animal plant patterns pheromone extractions
pheromones?
glandular secretions from animals scents that create powerful emotions  fear  rage
what is it?
alfred are you?
i'm on break from
oxbridge academy?
their new computer sciences division  how did you know?
can i at least have a drink?
sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win
hey i'm the one who kicked ivy's botanical butt  personally  me  i did
please be looking for me
al's main squeeze  is she here?  i'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue right?
i could have made it you know  i didn't need your help
this is to replace the bike i lost i'll get you the rest
keep it
of course dick grayson ward of the fabulously wealthy bruce wayne why would you need a few hundred dollars?
hey what's your problem?
i started racing after my parents died  there was something about the speed the danger that took me out of myself that made the hurt go away  you wouldn't understand
it's ten thirty in the morning
you'd be surprised
street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at oxbridge  they kicked me out  it doesn't matter i've won enough money to do what i've always dreamed
alfred has supported me my whole life  now i'm going to pay him back i'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude
what are you talking about?
servants masters it's  ridiculous alfred is the sweetest most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else
alfred and bruce are like family
paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes you call that family?
alfred's happy here
alpha  got it  what the hell is attack plan alpha?
youwsa  nothing but air
yeah if you've slept
this is easy
crimefighter's rule number one: never say that
crimefighter's rule number two
i'm afraid to ask
pow  what  kazow
what exactly are you doing?
it'll take the satellites about a minute to realign butdamn
damn?  damn is not good
you were a great scientist once don't squander your genius on evil
after you have frozen your icy tomb will plummet back to gotham
you know the law  no liquor before noon could lose my license
mr bane i'll finish off the city you as they say in showbiz are on  take the boys and kill the kids but bring me the bat
you're loosing your cool
go on kill me too  just as you killed my wife
nice suit  and today you are?
nightwing  scourge of darkest evil
this is all about fashion for you isn't it?
 a giant drilling truck burrowing under the city 
mr freeze
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum
the new antiquities exhibit  the second sun of the sudan
hurricane kept you up too?
of course  he's going to steal the giant white diamond
i was just hanging around
i thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs
watch the first step
you think freeze will take the bait?
you don't have two million  three million  
pull back  you can't make the jump
she's definitely part of this  it's weird for a while ivy was all i could think about  but then
i know  the feeling just vanished
i can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy
not all experiences are good bianca you can't always trust the people you want to
that's confidential  could you put the money on the dresser?
bill styles
bad yes  guy no  this is one majorly beautiful evil person
i'm totally over her  positively
me too  great stems though
ummhmmmm
how did you?
she's still alive  he's adapted his freezing technology to reverse mcgregor's syndrome  he's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease
can he save her?
no beauty
remember the victim at the airport toxins introduced through the mouth
what are you talking about?
who?
why is she so desperate to kiss us? i'm betting her lips are poison
we gotta get those locks changed
she knows who we are
i guess we'll just have to kill her
no sign of the snowman
if we could relay the sunlight
winded old timer?
they're overly protective  you're not going to hurt me are you ms
dr pamela isley
what can i do for you doctor?  a research grant?  a hospital wing?
don't you ever point a gun at me
actually i already work for you or did  your arboreal preservation project in south america
we cut our support  a conflict of ideologies  dr woodrue was a lunatic
i see you knew him
that lab was consumed by fire last week  how did you manage to escape?
forget the stars  look here at the earth our mother our womb  she deserves our loyalty and protection and yet you spoil her lands poison her oceans blacken her skies you're killing her
your intentions are noble but no diesel fuel for heat  no coolants to preserve food  millions would die of cold and hunger alone
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet
tell me billionaire would you warm faster to my pleas if i looked more like ms january here?
physical perfection charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster how do you explain your behavior?
i can't  but perhaps tonight over dinneri've just had an opening
a target kendall cap a fucking target what's wrong with you?
no?
umm  what i mean isno plans at the moment
and?
you're not even listening to me
what?  i'm sorry  you were saying
julie i'm not the marrying kind there are things about me you wouldn't understand
i know you're a dedicated bachelor that you've had a your wild nights
wild doesn't exactly cover it
but there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness i couldn't learn to understand
i wouldn't bet on that
i thought i was gonna have an attack go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou childs could tell i wasn't right
who's ivy?
what?
you just called me ivy  who's ivy?
dr isley  it was like i could feel you in the room  you'reenchanting gorgeous  the most beautiful woman i've ever seen  if you'reum freethis evening
make a choice bruce  her or me
wellumher
that's gotta hurt
what happened to his wife?
he needs extreme cold to survive his cryosuit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees
let me get this straight a brilliant citizen disfigured by a horrible accident reemerges as a psychotic supervillain bent on theft revenge and destruction you see a pattern here?
fuck what the fuck is going on 
i need the wayne diamonds
we gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
absolutely  just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator
whoa i made a mistake  i'm sorry don't go all protective on me  it won't happen again
dick you were reckless  you could have been killed
i got the diamond  quell problemo bruce?
of course  alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room
he's dying  and i can't deal with it
but he's never said a word
you know alfred  he'd never say anything  but i can tell  until you came along alfred was the only family i ever had  without him i don't know how i would have survived  he saved my life dick  and i've never told him
what do we do?
talk to him bruce  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel
mcgregor's syndrome  that's what freeze's wife had
yes  but alfred's condition is less severe  freeze's research says he cured a case like alfred's  it just doesn't say how
i checked the medical database  no one else is even close
i'm late for the dedication  then i go after freeze and ivy  alone
like hell you do
dick don't push me right now
or what?  no one can capture ivy but the big bad bat  crap  you just want her for yourself  don't you?  answer me damn it
yes  yes i want her so badly i can taste it  that's the whole point look at us  orphans  isolated obsessed to the exclusion of life love family  we're perfect targets she's done something to us got us fighting over her somehow
hail the allknowing bruce wayne here's what i know she loves me not you and it's driving you crazy it's why you stopped us from kissing because if you can't have her nobody can
i don't want to go 
she's clouded your mind  you're not thinking straight
that's no batlight it's a birdcall
her name is pamela isley  i saw her talking to gordon  she must have stolen his keys altered the signal
and she did it all for me  for love
she's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract
is that it bruce?  i'm under some magic spell?
she wants to kill you
you'd say anything to keep me away from her  to keep her for yourself
one question  when batgirl and i rolled off the telescope how come you didn't try and save us? it was the first time i fell and you weren't there to catch me
let me guess plant girl? vine lady? ms moss?
did  did you 
listen captain cold the suit maybe even though silver went out in the 70's  but those boots are unforgivable what is it with men?
impressive
well i my most unabominable snowman have been impressed by you in fact i propose a pairing  so i'm here to set you free
an enticing offer  but what does the lady want in return?
i love that belt  what are you about a fifty big and tall?
no gun  how disarming
i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
my reserves are exhausted  i must have the gems that power my suit
in my weakened state i am no match for the bat and the bird
trust me  vegetable magnetism
what about pike?
fine  while i retrieve my diamonds you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair  she's frozen in 
you will rescue my wife
make yourself right at home
where is my wife?
there was nothing i could do  batman deactivated her  she's dead
their bones will turn to ice  their blood will freeze in my hands
yes  i shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort  i will blanket the city in endless winter first gotham and then the world
i have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals  once you have frozen mankind my mutants will overrun the globe  the earth will become a brave new world of only plants and we shall rule them  for we will be the only two people left in the world
you will distract the bat and bird while i prepare to freeze gotham
can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
i like to talk to the person who runs the service  can you give me address?
he is the only one unaccounted for
that is far too merciful  batman will watch his beloved gotham perish then i will kill him
as a team the duncely duo protect each other  but the robin is young impetuous  if i could get him alone
one kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face  their secret identities would be revealed  but how best to bait a brid?
the way to a boy's heart is through his ego  what strapping young hero could resist his very ownsignal?
inspired ms ivy
prepare for a bitter harvest winter has come at last
freezy i'm feelinghot
i find that unlikely
okay my hair is brittle my skin is dry and i don't care  i'd weather blizzards to have you you're the most perfect man i've ever known
to be frozen  to never change  a life of perpetual iceolation there is little perfection in that
you framedhim
what say we turn up the heat?
you're skating on thin ice  my passion thaws for my bride alone
forget your frosty femme  these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite
give it up  if you threw yourself
i'm glad you came  i can't breathe without you
i want us to be together  but i need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf  i need a sign
how about dangerous curves?
of trust tell me your plan
kiss me and i'll tell you
tell me and i'll kiss you
this isn't our area whose area is this 
freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun  he's about to turn gotham into an ice cube
i've got to stop him
bad luck i'm afraid  it's time to die little bird
what do you mean?
you should have heeded your pointy eared pal  these lips can be murder
then you never loved me?
you're too late  say byebye birdie
what do we have here?  a lovely new supply of venom  i'll just take this to my laboratory for further study
you have to tell me what you're doing with my venom
our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications he cut the funding for our work 
hey i   holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do?
our work?
join you?  i've spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction and now you corrupt my research into some maniacal scheme for world domination when i get through you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry do you hear me you psycho?
dr isley?  pamela?  you look great especially for a dead woman
the dreams again sir?
i think they're getting worse
would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
then you'd have nothing to complain about
how's the sonar coming alfred?
a few hitches sir but i'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time
it'll never work
you killed him you fucking faggot 
scholarly research?
she has an excellent mind
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady i humbly apologize
i wonder if she'd go out with me
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
your parents' wake rain fell like tears
the night batman was born  what was i doing in the fields that night alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can't remember
i don't know sir your dear parents  suddenly gone so much loss
gee i'm not sure  alfred? how many rooms? total?
ninetythree including the sauna
we got  i don't know we got separated
it's happening again just like my parents a monster comes out of the night a scream two gunshots i killed them
what did you say?
he killed them twoface he slaughtered that boy's parents
no you said i i killed them
sorry to bother you sir i have some rather distressing news about master dick
is he all right?
i'm afraid master dick has gone traveling
he ran away?
actually he took the car
he boosted the jag?  is that all?
before or after the explosion?  mueller 
not the jaguar the _other_ car
the _rolls_?
too much wealth too fast half of gotham zombiedout a technology that self destructs he's protecting more than industrial secrets alfred
maybe they're right
which `they' might that be sir?
why do i keep doing this?
why indeed?
could i let batman go? for dick for me could i leave the shadows? have a life friends family
she's the first woman in a long time that's no she's the first woman ever and she loves batman not bruce wayne if i let go of batman i'll lose her
perhaps perhaps not why not ask the lady?
shut the fuck up you fucking faggot you just shut the fuck up
how are you feeling young man?
not that young it's been a long time since you've called me that
old habits die hard are you alright?
as well as can be expected i guess give me the bad news
i'm batman? i remember my life as bruce wayne  but all this it's like the life of a stranger
perhaps the fall
there's one other thing i feel
what?
afraid
bruce son listen to me you are a kind man a strong man but in truth you are not the most sane man
west was one thing but this 
a bat
what?
i remember a bat a monster a demon chasing me  oh my god alfred
master bruce?
all the answers are numbers
but 1 3 1 8 & 5 what do they mean?
what do maniacs always want?
recognition of course
letters in the alphabet
of course 13 is mmre
we finished the course and came here then heard an explosion   where's pike?
how about mr e
mystery
and another name for mystery?
enigma
what now sir?
claw island nygma's headquarters i'm sure that's where they're keeping chase  are all the batsuits destroyed?

why's that?
let's just say i could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent
bats aren't rodents dr meridian
holy fuck holy fuck what the fuck did you guys do?

she's a malaysian dream warden she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams  need one?
my opinion this letter writer is a total wacko
wacko? that a technical term?
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles work better for you?
so what you're saying this guy's a total wacko right?
i think the question would be do you have a thing for bats?
you're under military arrest it's not gonna happen what's wrong with baseball?
so this riddler he's dangerous?
what do you know about obsession?
it's a stretch but i'll manage
the letter writer is obsessed with you his only escape may be
to kill me
you understand obsession better than you let on
no insights here doc just trying to get comfortable on your couch  oops times up
that's usually my line
look i'd love to keep chatting
would you? i'm not so sure
it's too slow
but i'm going to have to get you out of those clothes
excuse me
i'm surprised you aren't blind by now
like normal folks
that kid is amazing
i don't get you bruce wayne
me? i'm easy especially after a couple of martinis
the glib cavalier routine it really is an act isn't it?
look i'm rock climbing sunday how about coming along?
bruce much to my surprise you seem like a really great guy
well it's a game of anticipation that's the beauty
but
well i met someone
fast work you just moved here
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang i think he felt it too
he sure did
what?
the style of the letters i'm getting matches those found at the crime sites why would the riddler be sending me riddles?  who's your decorator? uhaul?
a lot of what happened is jagged pieces missing i can't really remember i just get flashes usually in my dreams i'd kind of gotten used to them at least accepted them
and now
find anything interesting?
i just don't like it
why do i feel like the other man here?
come on bruce this is what i do for a living
i'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home
why do you do that?
what?
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask if you're jealous
i'm not
in a sense we are all two people the side we show in daylight and that side we keep in shadow
if i didn't know better i'd say you were sulking
keep me off the couch doc your fees are a little rich for me
give me the address
i don't know i like the army
touchy touchy
so how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of batman?
oh god bruce you're still jealous
and the beast slouches towards bethelem
there's something i want to talk with you about it'swell we i
your memories are repressed they're trying to break through relax try to remember
i don't want to remember
my parents are laid out in the library their skin smells like talcum powder i'm so small my father's diary is on his desk like always i'm opening the book reading i'm running out into the storm the book is in my hands i can't hear my screams over the rain i'm falling
what does it say? what hurts so much bruce? what does the book say?
i don't
c'mon ray everyone hates the army during basic i'll tell you straight i hated it here
the last entry read bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight  bruce insists i made them go out i made them take me to the movie to that theater  it was my fault i killed them
oh god bruce you were a child you weren't responsible
not the bat?
what?
i always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life but it wasn't the real fear was hiding underneath: what i read in the journal that my parents' deaths were my fault that's what i couldn't remember that's the crime i've been paying for all these years
what are you talking about?
okay i'm outta here
excuse me
where will you go? the circus is halfway to metropolis by now
i got no place at the circus without my family i'm going to get a fix on twoface then i'm going to kill him
you did basic here?
listen dick killing twoface won't take the pain away it'll make it worse
i need to be part of this
absolutely not
me and my brother chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire dad's knee was going chris was engaged you know that? twoface tookeverything now i can pay him back
back off man
you don't understand it's an addiction you fight night after night trying to fill the emptiness but the pain's back in the morning and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice  i want better for you
what the hell did you think you were doing?
you have a real gratitude problem you know that bruce? i need a name batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
how about richard grayson college student?
i missed twoface by a heartbeat when we catch him you gotta let me kill him
there's no need
we don't kill killing is what damns you it what am i talking about? this conversation is over you're going away to school
you can't
dick let go revenge will eat you alive trust me i know
but what about all the good we can do? there are monsters out there gotham needs us
exactly and once you'd killed him you'd be lost like me  all this has to be a choice otherwiseit's a curse
bruce you can't

excuse me sir  commissioner gordon was compelled to leave  very unexpectedly  he asked me to convey his regrets
it's all right alfred everything's under control
where's the boy?
upstairs he's quite docile
i know the feeling it won't last  he's a long way ahead of where i was at his age
you smoke ray?
how long's it been alfred? a quarter of a century?  it seems like yesterday i guess we ended up doing more harm than good
don't ever say that sir don't ever believe it
like your boyfriend he's kinda hot
take me let the boy go
gosh i could kill you but then you'd miss my party and you batman  you're the guest of honor
what are you talking about?
you know we should've sat down and had us a little hearttoheart i bet we would have got on famously
 murderer
get in the car
look police
next  could i see your documents please?
this is one of those interrogation tricks isn't it? you don't give me a cigarette till i tell you more
i know i called them
what about the girl?
can't we 
how much do you weigh?
not even a 'thank you'?
i'll have to ask you for that film
please
the joker is a murderer and you were as good as dead so 
look i appreciate what you did for me but this is my job and i'm keeping those pictures
all right i'll develop the photos anything i don't want is yours
hey ray just had a nice talk with your buddy kendall  seems you killed three people
how do i know you won't keep them all?
thank you vicki
 how long have i been out?
quite a while i took the scenic route
what is this stuff? kevlar?
better it's not on the market yet
it doesn't protect your head though
how'd you find this place?
they don't come down here they're afraid of the lights
i loathe bats
that son of a bitch
what is that?
they've got it all wrong they're watching the warehouses the loading docks looking for a tamperer the joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source
that can't be right that would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned we'd all be dead
i just can't absorb it all this place the equipment what it must have cost  why all the secrecy? why do you wear the mask?
i don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me
is this what you wanted?
you could've killed him you know you could've killed the joker
i assume in my usual charming manner i've just insulted the host  alexander knox
bruce wayne   i've read your work  i quite like it
great  give me a grant
that'd be my reaction too 
"this is miss vale"  that felt redundant
that's how it is chum one column  and i can bring all this tumbling down i can take you off the streets for good
what is it you want?
i want you to hang up the suit and i want you to stay away from vicki
i can't do that not while the joker's still at large
see i don't know how it happened she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwedup guy but she's in love with you
tell me knox if you've got the story why haven't you printed it?
do you want a drink?
yeah a drink 'civilized' right?
i don't seek publicity  will you be staying in gotham for a while?
he's lying
as far as i know
do you sail?
two drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops  look i bore myself silly  let's talk about you how the hell did you wind up in corto maltese?
that's a tough one  have you ever seen combat?
no
neither had i  odd desire for a woman i guess
odd desire for anyone
well  a couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid i went down there for newsweek the beaches were nice  and at nights  they had a band  i danced on the hotel patio  of course i never saw what was really happening there when the war broke out i had to go back and i promised myself that this time i wouldn't look away
what did you see?
there's terror everywhere  if you train yourself to look for it
well why didn't you say so? we'll just drop all your charges then 
bruce really when i say these things i don't mean to criticize you
in other words what right do i have to talk about terror
as much as i do  it's not that  i don't want to be depressing that's all
i'm sorry bruce i just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation
but it's not fair  i'm half drunk and you're not even 
i'll take you home if you'd like
god  you would  come on bruce  i just want to get two drinks in you  as an experiment
maybe we should just kiss
i don't sing very well
to tell you the truth i'd just about given up waiting
fuck "you're serious" raymond you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours so if you've got something to say say it
i said i'd call you the minute i got free  and i did  and here we are
all street mimes should be executed
i know it's late i  are you there?
yes bruce  i'm here 
i'm sorry i had to stand you up today i'd like to make it up to you
well bruce  i don't think  that would be possible
i realize the way things have gone between us   i wish you'd reconsider
vicki? this is batman i thought i'd call and see how you're doing
 i know it's you bruce i'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it
who's this 'bruce'? are you trying to make me jealous?
so childs made some side money so what? people are dead ray and the only one we have to blame is you 
so we just pretend none of this ever happened we never met we    you're going to get yourself killed bruce you know that don't you?
no one would miss me
money makes money vicki the foundation runs itself  i'm extraneous to the process
you're one man you can't save everybody
bruce at the rate you're going you can't even save yourself
it's like the last time he sent me a present before he 
oh bruce don't tell me you carry it around with you
"it worked for van gogh let's kiss and make up"
keep her on the line
i'm sorry she hung up what are 
i didn't shoot west 
finding out where she is
how can you do that if she's already off the line?
got it
what now?
all this apparatus vicki this house and the money and the power  it was never mine it was something i inherited bruce wayne was something i inherited  all i ever hoped for was someone who could see through bruce  who could see me  and not be frightened
i'm frightened of you bruce i'm frightened for you
i don't know why i'm doing this i half wish you'd stay a cripple
ohhhh you don't mean that
i don't but i do it's just i love you bruce i don't want you to
we'll raid the ace the moment we get a warrant
i apologize 
he'll be ready when you do remember what happened at the apartment
all right bruce what do you suggest?
i suggest a nice big bomb
good a bomb on a blind tip from bruce wayne  we do have laws
then for god's sake harvey cancel the anniversary celebration
we've told him we'll deal what could he possible have to gain by 
do you still think the joker cares about money??
we got 'em
somebody's killed the power
what?
what is your intended purpose of your visit to the united states?
you saw west's body
somebody's killed the 
boss jesus they've 
move can't you do something??
i missed you lieutenant
sorry  we had another bat sighting
i'm on top of it  if there's a problem 
i answer to grissom punk  not to you
got it all figured huh?  grissom just sits back and hands you the reins   maybe he don't know what we know
what are you talking about?
let's beat it man  i don't like it up here
and he'd been shot
what are you scared of heights?
i dunno man  after what happened to johnny gobs  
look johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right?  no big loss
that ain't what i heard  that ain't what i heard at all  i heard the bat got him
gimme a break will you?  shut up
five stories straight down there was no blood in the body
there was no blood man  my brother says all the bad things you done they come back and haunt you
my brother's a priest man
you shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid man  you shouldn'ta 
okay a breakin  trash the office make off with the books  "industrial espionage"
you shot childs and nunez
why do you need me to handle a simple breakin?
i understand
it's me  "sugar bumps"
jack?  thank god  i can't believe it's you  i heard you'd been 
it's not the girl jack  sooner or later you would've tried to take me  you may get me now but your life won't be worth a dime
jack listen  we'll cut a deal 
jack   please   wipe that lunatic grin off your face
i don't like taking orders from grissom and i especially don't like taking orders from grissom's goon
i've considered that possibility
and what happens if we say no?
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession i'll write a confession
nobody wants a war carmine  if we can't do business we shake hands and part friends
that's it?
joker here can we talk?
i'd like to read a prepared statement 'while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace'
all right then here's the deal total amnesty and the sum of ten million dollars payable in 
ten million dollars ten mi  you cheapskates i've just wiped out the stock market i've cost you billions  i want ten million and one
please we'll talk just tell us what you expect
 thank you
and you want a 
maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist  people might like to see the face behind the makeup
you saved kendall's life 
i've seen worse  much worse
 why the mask?
you scum  you sick filth you did that to her
i'll see you burn  i'll see you dead  get away from me
how'd you know it was me?
burned out  i need a vacation
god vick a girl could get hurt doing this
a girl could get killed   so they tell me  what's new and hot in gotham city?
oh it's too good  we got a sixfoot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers
evildoers huh?  big or small?
raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony otherwise this is just another story 
small so far  i think he's leaving the big fish for harvey dent
our next da  i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser  did you get your invitation yet?
no
man i feel like robin leach  you actually know all these people?
where does one man get all this junk?
all aver the world  they say he's spent half of his life overseas
rich  reclusive  bankrolls half a dozen charities
likes to kill? knox  women find him magnetic
i bet they like him for his big charity balls
that and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks
we're not finished yet 
oh  sorry  i was thinking
what were you thinking?
yum yum
guess who's got a date with bruce wayne?
peanuts?
plain or roasted?  alex i'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research
nice snap huh?  pulitzer prize 1963
yep  he watched the whole thing happen   recognize the beat cop?  jim gordon
oh bruce
you are on drugs
we don't need the tapes 
yeah?  according to this he's in geneva from '76 to '79 well i called geneva  nobody there's even heard of the guy   probably off in tibet with some kung fu master
are they paying you for all this?
everybody needs a hobby  you explain it vicki  he walks out on his own party  half an hour later who turns up?  batman  sees an execution freaks out in an alleyway  no place to change
allie i know exactly why you're doing this
he's best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent  they would know
alexander i know you
right  and they know him  and that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for 
i've had it with you  i'm leaving
the guy's bats all right he's bat shit crazy he    i can't believe it i was right
allie he's not
oh you don't? what else do you have on me? you haven't found any bodies yet have you?

vicki we got a wealthy millionaire here who dresses up like a bat he goes out at night and swings around  in his cape  on a rope  crazy batstard
allie he wants to tell me i had a roll of film his face was on it he knew that  and he let me keep

yeah yeah little winded did you see that?
not true cadet i've got a gun 
god yes allie i've gotta say  that was the ballsiest move i ever
ahm well you know ~ that's a tough question  on one' level i think it 
jennifer can stay and look after kevin
sounds great  excellent  though ahm there's this guy who's coming to work at the gallery from england
yeeees?
and they asked me if we'd like to  you know put him up for a while
there aren't hotels?
yes there are hotels  they just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real american family  popcorn waffles all that stuff
and what did you say?
do we know anything about him?
two weeks holiday
he  he made me do it 
ahm  he's male  he's english  he's a doctor of er  at least 2 things  i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf  or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time  i think we're looking at someone moderately normal here
david  are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
it's the last thing we need
scottish
well they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like 
did you really ask?
i'm not sure i got the right person but they were a bit busy 
it isn't working any more david
jesus
go ahead

there were three strawberries
liar
ali?  what's wrong?
shut up kevin  honey youre not making sense 
okay  it's not a problem let's just sit  i'11 talk to the gallery 
david i'm serious
i know you are  very serious  most of the time these days
hi
hi  roses
yes  and	i have a wine for dinner that will kill you
i guess nunez wasn't dead after all he came after us with a vengeance  you know the rest
great  you said you'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else  did you?
sort of half
meaning?
i was sort of half way through the sentence in which i would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake
at least you didn't bring mr bean with you
0 my god
sorry honey  he just happened to tag along
let's get a coffee
everything's gonna be fine
shhh
and the bodies?
it was nothing  we're not  he just makes me laugh  when was the last time we laughed?  any of us?
maybe i ought to think about getting another job
here let me do that
he's not too bad  i can live with him
two dollars please
annie it's me
oh right yeah  two dollars please
he doesn't like to say much does he?
right first time
excuse me  mr grierson called down he's ready to see you upstairs
i promised them i'd ask you where west and the others are
goodnight annie
big day today huh? 78
david  there's a call for you  it's your wife
ah mr bean 
better go  grierson hates people being late
seems to be a problem with the door where's the picture gone?
ahm
oh jesus  oh god  oh jesus god  oh mary mother of jesus oh jesus of nazareth
oh dear
what happened?
washout rejects guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"
oh yes
it wasn't a dream was it  i have to go in to work and tell them whistler's mother now looks like danny de vito
it's very good bernie
i was hoping du  bean might take a look at my computer project today
yes  i'11 mention it to him  but  he's kind of his own guy you know?
howls he getting on with the family?
and howls alison?
she's  well she's good
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers  nice guy  good looking
yes isn't he
are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you?
it's great when people who work together can become real friends
look i've left bean on his own nice to chat though bernie  always a subtle joy
'emergency measures in your book means sack people right?
great day  at last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future
yes look i wanted to talk to you about this  i'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that
everything okay david?
yes  ahm  i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to
he's just parking the governor's car
look at all this  publicity expenditure  catering  all completely fictional  back as far as june 93 
lord walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the english art world  has a couple of doctorates no less
that first night with pike i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300
so  i'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel
love to sir but no can do  no spare room  period
we'll be able to start this afternoon  i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery  now that'll impress the governor
what a pleasure governor reynolds  i'd like you to meet some of our staff here 
and that's where you introduce me to the governor
this is elmer our longest serving
okay that'll do  the governor's here in half an hour  we have to be totally ready then  no excuses  period
he's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century
thank you sir  although i'm afraid i don't quite see how we can 
say that again son
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
i beg your pardon?
i said say that again son  because the next time you do i'll make sure you're in there with my daughter but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now
i'm er  sorry if you've been waiting a long time
so why not haul your   nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case
oh look i mean it's kind of the last thing i mean i'd really like to but things at home are kind of sensitive so i couldn't really er 
i thought perhaps as vicepresident and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year the massive financial loss 
tomorrow  you have a problem with that?
ah david  finally  and this must be our professor from across the sea
ah he certainly has something sir
very pleased you've taken him in david  at a time when noone's job is safe it really identifies you as a team player
he was sickly had that shaking thing whatd'yacall it epoxy?
yes although i really thank you  yes it's great to have him with us the whole family's very excited
glad to hear it  tell poor mr larson to come through will you?
you're not going to 
no
the thing is sir i've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection with the help of dr bean here  and we feel the time's come for whistler's mum to have her first facelift
time taken its toll on the old girl eh?
thank you david  however flattery will get you nowhere  truth is i have a rather different plan for whistler's dear mama  bernie and i have been inspecting our books  and the long and short of it is we cannot survive with our current losses so 
 you have to sack me  i understand sir  i'll go quietly  in fact i'll go right now
brilliant huh?  i already have a prospective buyer  the current governor of california no less who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal  spread the news  i think decisive leadership has done the trick don't you?
i think you're wrong david  she looks as fine as she's ever looked worth every cent of the 10 million dollars
how much money are you carrying with you?
epilepsy
ahm
bravo  let's put on a good show tomorrow shall we?  don't want anything to go wrong
well congratulations  isn't that great david?
david david david 
i'm fired?  because i let a copy of a painting the get stolen?
i owe you a very serious apology young man  it wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this  i sincerely hope that you do not
of course
and a car
maybe two cars
a car sounds sensible
he said he worked there 
oh come on  the guy's going to be a creep  all englishmen are ugly
what makes you say that?
all the guys they claim are english to and goodlooking like dan day lewis and liam neeson turn out to be irish  even anthony hopkins is welsh  prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors
richard burton was very goodlooking
welsh
welsh again
honey calm down now it's okay
jen  you don't wanna talk about it?
it's you and mom that need to talk
bye dad
no did he tell you about it? about the business childs ran?
as you can see security's pretty tight in this section  nobody gets past elmer here  isn't that right?
you've known me five years elmer when do you get to calling me david?
you arrange those flowers yourself?
sure did
they're pretty  learn it in the army?
hiya dad ~ i'll need you upstairs for homework in about   oh 20 minutes
who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived
well michael bolton's pretty grisly
he was incredible  this guy is fearless  he has no fear
that's one  way of looking at it  you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'
what business?
well there is that 
hey en nice bike' but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver
is jenny gonna be okay?
she was wearing a helmet  it could have been worse

doctor jacobson?
yes?
we need you urgently in c theatre
damn  i was just going to number 4 
where?
it is urgent sir
what a pleasure governor  welcome
hi grierson forgive the war paint  going on to my regiment/s reunion after
interesting suit
why thank you sir
off the peg?
i've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two  not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft  but you didn't even know it'd been stolen  i'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys
i am sorry you feel that way
shut up kevin
no seriously  i know he's your boyfriend but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird  what do you think it is dad?  jen says it's a moustache i say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes resting
what about the phosphorous grenade?

nope
i wish i could use that at school  "hey teach no hard feelings  it's just things between us ain't what they used to be and i need a little space ya know?  so i'11 see you around in a couple of years maybe"

helen got it for me in oslo
yeah i want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then i'll help you
oh honey i'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home
oh no
jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family
we should be flattered that she wants to sell our house
i know i just wish she'd leave us alone
wave at the lion
don't forget the balls ernie
pike and i got separated then i heard gunfire close
adam your bozman building is a beauty
yeah it turned out okay  we applied for a national historical plaque for it  that'll be the third one on main street
you're doing it adam  you're saving this town
slow down there honey i don't want the vibration to weaken the model
this fire wasn't burning when we left the house
how's your arm?
you'd better sit down hon
i am sitting
i'll tell you what barbara  i don't think we survived that crash
you saved my  uh  life or whatever something
so you killed him?
two hours
what?
that's how long you were gone
anything happen while i was away?
handbook for the recently diseased
de<u>ceased</u>  i don't know where it came from
i don't think we survived the crash
i don't like situations like this i hate it when i'm not in control so just tell me the basics
this book isn't arranged that way what do you want to know?
there are a thousand things why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  is this a punishment?  are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? and how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
whose blood is that jay?
cabin fever hon?
i can't clean anything  the vacuum is out in the garage  i can't leave the house  why don't they tell us something?  where are all the other dead people in the world?  why is it just you and me?
maybe this is heaven
in heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper
hon i didn't want to die but really this is fine with me  as long as i never have to wash dishes again
dishes?  we haven't eaten in three weeks  adam i'm not like you i really need to be around <u>people</u> get out to the church and go grocery shopping
god it's jane butterfield
what's she doing here?
she can't see you right?  in the book rule number two: the living usually won't see the dead
won't?  or can't?
what do you mean west's?
just says 'won't'  wait a minute here it says 'the living are arrogant they think they'll never die so they refuse to see the dead'
arrogant  that's jane butterfield all right
i guess if i'm going to be dead i'll just have to be the best dead person ever
adam we <u>are</u> in hell  i hate these people
they make gypsies look good
is this a punishment for something we did in life?  what can we do?
i don't know if there's anything we can do
oh honey we may need that
barbara honey  don't go out there  you don't know 
oh adam don't ever leave me alone
you looked beautiful last night you know
yes
where have you been jay?
<u>you</u> left me
we're trapped in this house forever with those people
you can't say that for sure  it could be a transitional thing like a postlife crisis  we just have to be tougher with them come on  have some brandy spirits get it?
look in the index maybe there's like an emergency number or something
that's it?  no number or instructions?
that little girl saw us
she couldn't have  we can't <u>make</u> them see us
but she <u>saw</u> us  i could feel it
there's nothing we can do  it's just a matter of time before they unlock this room  there goes my model  there goes our last refuge
we're not going to wait here like cornered animals  i can tell you that  we need help  i'm going to talk to that little girl
roberto what the fuck?
what about this beetle guy?
we don't know who he is   i'm going to talk to that little girl
are you crazy?  she can't hear you
i don't know what are you looking up?
we need some help  i found something this morning  here emergencies  'in case of emergency draw door'
yet another triumph for adam and barbara in the afterlife
 not what i expected when we walked through that door
my god we're back where we started
look at this everything is different down here  all our furniture is gone
we'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here  barbara and i worked very hard on this house
we just want to check your pack 
that guy is in our cemetery  oh adam
god this is so corny  have we been reduced to this?  sheets?
i feel really stupid
well i don't know we don't get many visitors
where are your skulls and bones?
lydia's trying but they don't believe her
she's got <u>photos</u> barbara
adam you had a photo of big foot
did you copy these gravestones right adam?
of course i did
you know it's not like that 
here's something
i didn't do that one hmmm
go ahead third time's a charm
what happened?
three times  powerful number
has anything been simple so far? from the look of the shovel we dig
i guess we open it
she's only fourteen
honey  let's go
go?  what d'ya mean?  we need help
right?
honey i think that was a mistake
i am not going to expose that little girl to that pervert down there
but <u>we</u> let him out
and your sushi was remarkable
the sushi?  i did the wine didn't you do the sushi?
n no  i just did the ink spots
maybe they'll leave now  that snake was a pretty nasty customer
he might have hurt somebody
<u>adam</u>  why did you build a whorehouse?  have you ever been to?
lydia believe me we know all the hard stuff is the same over here  you're going to be who you are whether you're alive or dead  and over here  it's it's flat there's no food no colors  you can't smell the flowers  if we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful
you gotta untie me  i didn't do this thing ray
you know i've been thinking  i could teach lydia to sew
little black party dresses?
ah adam you don't know anything about little girls  she's just missed out on some love that's all
let's see if she can get my model back
we've been given a gift here honey  a real live little girl she likes us a lot  she needs us maybe that's why we died so young to keep us from getting so attached to <u>things</u>  the house antiques your model  look at us we didn't have room for anyone
what?
what time is it?
3:30 i guess
oh adam don't tease her  you never got an a in science in your life
a are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
you hated west more than any of us
aren't you scared?
i'm not scared of ralph lauren those are <u>sheets</u>  are you gross under there?  are you <u>night of the</u> <u>living dead</u> under there?  like all bloody veins and pus?
what?
you can actually see us?  without the sheets?
nobody else can
why are you creeping around delia's bedroom?
we were trying to scare your mother
<u>you</u> did this?  you carved all these little figures and houses and things?
i certainly did  i'd finish it too but i don't get out much
and this used to be your house i bet  why do you want to scare everybody?
maybe but that don't make me a killer 
we want to frighten you away  so that you'll move out
we weren't there  the handbook says funerals aren't for the dead
you tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house
what is going on?
did you get the paint?
we studied all day yesterday don't tell me
so can i?
uhuh  only if you got <u>above</u> a c on science
you don't have an appointment do you?
nine months?  what difference does that make?
you're the only one missing a grenade
good luck  you're going to use up all your help vouchers
help vouchers?
wait for who?
aren't you dead?
hell no  i'm rolling  i'm a businessman  i'm the man what <u>am</u> <u>beee</u>tel <u>jooose</u>  <u>who</u> do i gotta kill?
<u>so</u> you the dead want me <u>the</u> <u>undead</u> to throw the live guys  mommie daddy and lolita who might not mind a tumble with an older guy out into the cold? even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
but the deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife  so what's my cut?
okay  but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad
this is <u>my</u> town
ray this is my life here i ain't gonna pretend i'm not happy west is gone but you know i couldn't have done this it's not in me
<u>barbara</u>?
are you available?
hell is other people  you obviously don't read much besides things seem pretty quiet here  you should thank god you didn't die in italy  the deetzes  okay  have you been studying the manual?
we tried
i heard  tore your face right off  bad news  it obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you
we have to start simpler is that it?
<u>don't say his name</u>  just practice do it <u>yourself</u>
handbook?  when?
<u>never trust the living</u>  we <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death
yes or no?  do you want the deetzes out or in?
please join us  come on forward
if not you then who?
all right  who are you?
we're
just get some people out of our house
bio<u>busting</u>  i <u>loves</u> biobusting who do i gotta kill?  family  right?  obnoxious i bet  mommie daddy piglets
just one daughter
folks be reasonable here  i'm at your service  you be the judge i'm a harmless guy  try me
i don't like charles deetz particularly but you could have <u>killed</u> him
you lillylivered bleeding hearts
i'd nearly given up on you  i was about to leave  i do have other clients
are you juno our case worker?
mueller
yes  i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed deserved and available
we're very unhappy
 like you used to be?
no
if we have trouble  what about the guy in the flyer?  betelge
no you don't  he does not work well with others
what do you mean?  what's he do?
he's a freelance bioexorcist claims to get rid of the living but he's a troublemaker  he's pushy  he's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years
our cemetery?
the whorehouse was my idea i want betelgeuse out of the picture  we've got some serious talking to do
oh come on 
about what?
what about betelgeuse?
if i had seen a ghost at your age i would have been frightened out of my wits
you're not gross  why were you wearing a sheet?
tell the truth
we can't  we haven't left the house since the funeral
i don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u> besides there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it  i'm getting out of here
i hate you  i can't trust anybody
he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you
no lydia we're dead
we're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away 
i want to be dead too
no you don't  no lydia why?
so <u>never</u> let beetle juice out never  besides  we're thinking about letting everyone stay you and your father and mother can stay too
how'd you do on the science test?
hi barb  i'm glad i caught you i heard you were on vacation
that's right jane  complete vacation
honey  today i am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars
no  jane it is 6:45 in the morning
look at me think of me as cash this offer is really real  from a rich man in new york city who only saw a photograph
jane don't send photographs of our house around the country we're not interested in selling
that's exactly what he says about you
you could double the size of your hardware store  you'll be rich
and live in what our station wagon?
oh honey i didn't mean anything  it's just too big for you two i know these things
mr and mrs maitland?  i've come for the last time  where are you?  barb
cookie they are dead dead deadski
of course they're dead  they're ghosts
no i mean they've gone decamped  split  vanished
where'd they go?
the happy hunting ground  who cares?
are you a spirit too?
you hated west mueller loved him 
sort of  high spirit  heh heh listen cookie i've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years  all i want is to get out
i want to get in
you do?  over here?  on <u>my</u> side?
i think so
well yes of course  it's great over here  you'll meet all the greats  james dean  buddy holly  'the little things a you say and do make me want to be with youahoo'
well it can't be any worse than my life here
that's right  they treat you like scum i bet?
yeah
i can't help you from this side but here's how we do it  so <u>simple</u>  say my name three times that's all  i'll be all yours then i'll bring you over here in style
i i don't know what your name is
enough to go to prison? childs' px scam mueller was in on it 
minor problem  the rules  i can't tell it to you  but do you know how to play charades?
yes
three syllables
no dummy  two
i don't know what that signal means
beetle
breakfast beetle?  beetle?  beetle fruit?  fruit bat?  fruit battle? volkswagen?  fruit wagon?
i am <u>not</u>  beetle juice?
that's it
your name is <u>beetle juice</u>?  yecch that's as bad as <u>deee</u>lia <u>deee</u>tz
bullshit
god you're anatomically correct
just <u>say</u> it
you were the snake  right?  i know  i saw you
you've <u>got</u> to say it
no i don't  i don't take orders from smurfs
how'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now  i can do it if i get out
they'd look silly on me  i'm fourteen years old
so you're ready for me now?
you've got to help them
can you help <u>me</u>?
look in my pack
 i will
w what is it?

your qu?  but you're
yes of course you are  well otho had an intuition  call it a hunch  that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house  and it certainly is  charles you're lucky the yuppies are buying condos so you can afford what i'm going to have to do to this place we are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>
otho you've got to help me get maxie dean up here  i have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable
he's a clovenhooved beast
he's your cousin
otho?
it's <u>otho</u>
why?
i can't believe that we're eating cantonese  is there no szechuan up here?  hunan?
lydia at your age you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>  charles we need to call that awful jane butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door  can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
i feel like we've been at war charles
at least insofar as we have our first casualty  me
otho'll know what to do
what's he going to do?  viciously rearrange their environment?
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration
let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for max and sarah because i've bought options on property all over town  i need max's financing
just don't tell lydia
why not?
is there a problem?
combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me
they're probably guilty about what they did to me
what do you think honey?
lydia relax  we'll build you a darkroom in the basement
yeah maybe if he's nice he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn
where is your mother?
stepmother  she's out torturing the movers
i was just trying to open the door  mrs butterfield brought over a skeleton key
skeleton keys never work  anyway this can wait  we'll get a crowbar later  your mother
stepmother
what?
you're lying 
darling can't you see i'm relaxing in here
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw
dad  do you believe me?
yes  except when you creep around in your mother's 
stepmother's
 sheets
well this is i mean this is the weirdest 
lydia i don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes but 
the attic room is locked 
answer your mother
why why didn't you tell me?
look at all that <u>parking</u>
now let's get back to business i want to get maxie dean and sarah up here immediately  i can make history here  i'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center and amusement park
i cannot believe this
i'll bring the wine and the business plan  and lydia you'll bring the ghosts
i can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts  they're not here
they're not here anymore
not <u>a building</u>  that's the beauty of it  i think i can buy the <u>whole town</u>  these people don't know the value of their property
then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere
just a minute maxie  somebody
no listen we'll talk about this visiting later i gotta go i gotta meeting on the japanese joint venture
that still doesn't mean you didn't kill him
great idea maxie  those japanese could <u>run</u> it for us  build them a dormitory in the woods  listen think right about it will you? we've almost got the house ready you bring sarah with you and i'll show you
i don't care from guilt  i just want to <u>see</u> them
are they suffering?
i plan to have a stroke from the amount of msg that's in this food
we'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer new york  i'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture  and when otho and i get through with this house you people are not going to recognize it
<u>you jerks</u>  that is my art and it is <u>dangerous</u>  you think i want to die like that?  lydia  moving is a family affair so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs
any particular kind?
i can't believe you are doing this to me  <u>ghosts</u>  i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight  otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic  my agent bernard is bringing some woman who writes for <u>architectural digest</u>  in fact no one here tonight has not been in <u>vanity fair</u>  except you
i <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid
don't you <u>dare</u>
you saw west right? how was he killed?
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon
it wasn't a joke
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you and you didn't get scared 
all right you dead people  come on out or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with
shhhh  they didn't commit suicide
lydia i will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors  you help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry
that was the single most unattractive window treatment i have ever seen in the entire of my existence
is the rest of the house as bad as this?
the rest of the house is probably worse  when can you and i get started?
what's wrong?
full clip to the body 
okay?
you read my <u>mind</u>  i love clients who can read my mind  i don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural
<u>i know</u> i read your book <u>the</u> <u>haunted tapestries of the waldorf</u>
what do you think?
viridian?
bluegreen  hydrated chromic oxide  remember i'm schooled in chemistry  i was a hair analyst briefly  interior design is a <u>science</u> delia  think of me as doctor otho  and this patient is truly <u>sick</u>
<u>oh my god</u>
otho i can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles
is there much more of this torture?
that's charles' study  but you don't have to even look in there he'll love whatever you do to it  he's such a sheep
from up close or far away?
'i' will tell you what is boring  once you cover up the wallpaper knock down a few walls alter the traffic patterns and  perhaps  only perhaps  think about an inground pool  the place <u>might</u> just be livable  what's on the third floor?
attic space
you don't have a key?
maybe charles does
i have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door
now lydia favor us about your ghosts
<u>no</u>  do not encourage this little person
oh delia lighten up
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts  that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>
look at that <u>detail</u>
his chest was hamburger 
are they still here otho?
what's happening to them?
well there's a little deetz at least  boy when you city people do something you do it right don't you?
is this the key to the attic?
are we going to be seeing you at miss shannon's boarding school?
yes but i'm going to live at home
hellooo  how's school?
it's okay  how's the dirt business?
it's bad luck  and i believe hugely in luck
otho that's terrible
way i figure it west must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them so they decided to get rid of him first
they don't want to come down
all presences have a home space a place where they live so to speak  where do they hide out?
perhaps if i were properly motivated
wait a minute  what am i worried about?  otho you can't even change a tire
their wedding clothes
<u>adam</u>  <u>adam</u>
the injection will ease the pain and swelling mr gardiner
i understand i've seen it done before
you were wrong it did hurt
it's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone
they?
yes i think so too
however with injuries such as this i have run into minor hemorrhaging which really isn't too serious at the time but can cause secondary problems if not looked after
you can pull your trousers up now
oh fine
just to take the proper precautions mr gardiner i'd recommend we take you downstairs and xray your leg   by the way mr gardiner i would like to ask you something straight out
 straight out?
yes are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand's?
claim?  oh claim that's what thomas asked me
thomas? who's thomas?
thomas franklin an attorney
we are both from prague
i i don't know
an attorney?
yes
then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
there's no need for a claim the garden is a healthy one
oh i see   well then you're a very funny man mr gardiner you caught me off guard i must admit
thank you
good keep your weight off that leg mr gardiner in fact it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two if that would be would be possible since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs i can promise you the finest in care unless of course you would prefer to go elsewhere
yes i could stay here thank you
fine would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
i'll send wilson up to take you for xrays mr gardiner feel free to use the telephone and please let me know if you have any discomfort
what don't you know?
 and please call me robert
chauncey there you are what are you doing on that leg?
it's fine today robert
i swear chauncey between you and benjamin i've got my hands full   say that is coming along the swelling has gone down considerably   any pain here?
 benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his financial institute today but obviously the strain would be impossible how about here chauncey any soreness?
 were you going somewhere?
no robert
 oh   my god i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers anyway the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture i felt he's due here soon i believe
yes robert i know about the president
 oh? you've heard?
there's no time to think ray we gotta get out of here you untie me we grab the guns get kendall and nunez and make a run for it 
yes ben called me he wants me to meet the president
he does does he?
yes ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock
why that's terrific chauncey
 it's five of you'd best get on in there
i would like to walk today
hell yes  walk you're meeting the president aren't you?
 he's gone chauncey
yes robert i have seen it before it happens to old people
will you be leaving now robert?
no no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the mp's 
in a day or two yes
eve is going to stay the house will not be closed
 you've become quite a close friend of eve's  haven't you mr   chance?
yes i love eve very much
i see   and you are really a gardener aren't you?
i know exactly what you mean today the businessman is at the mercy of kidlawyers from the sec all they want to do is regulate our natural growth it's happening across the country
to everyone i'm afraid the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession as we know it is being legislated out of existence
 no of course you don't excuse me for being so presumptuous no man knows everything about another man  however very few are honest enough to admit it
some pain is to be expected   and i think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest   it's late i'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed
and you benjamin must be strong and brave for me turn over please
a test will no doubt link you to the killing 
no more robert no more needles
it's not good ben  i'm sure you can feel it
good god eve  you'll freeze out here
i wanted some fresh air robert how is mr gardiner?
a rather large contusion but i don't feel there is any serious damage i'd like to keep an eye on him though  i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days
stay here? is that necessary?
not necessary but preferable i don't think he'll be a bother he seems like a most refreshing sort of man
yes he is different not the kind of person one usually meets in washington
how true mr gardiner may be a welcome change of pace
he's very intense and internal don't you think?
you i've seen you around the base but you  you're not army are you?
at times yes but that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident actually i found him to have quite a sense of humor
good it might be pleasant for a couple of days   robert is there any improvement?
 eve  this has been an exhausting day for ben
 but he's?
 he walked off
 do you think we should look for him?
i don't think so he should be along soon
we have to find him robert  he could be lost something may have happened we can't leave him
you really care for him don't you eve?
i do  we do  both of us ben and i feel so much for chauncey
that's it you're that policeman with friends in low places tell me how's guissepe torres doing these days? those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer 
 and he told us that he had been living there since he was a child working as a gardener he showed us a room in the garage where he said he stayed and i well i didn't really believe him of course  but why the act?
i have no idea
another thing that baffles me doctor  what was his connection with the deceased? major financial dealings obviously  but our firm has no record of any such transactions
hmmm you say he showed you his garden?
well he said it was his he walked us through it
i see  mr franklin i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr gardiner to yourselves there's no telling what he was involved in and the matter may be extremely confidential so please not a word
of course doctor i understand
fine thank you mr franklin
gentlemen i didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations i just want to explore the possibilities now i have three questions; is the man a foreign agent? or have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? or thirdly have the man's files been destroyed? now i'd like some answers
gardiner is not a foreign agent there are now sixteen countries investigating the man we can rule that out
i've done nothing wrong  i'm the victim here
i don't think that's entirely true grover
and what do the boys around intelligence think?
well mr president they don't quite know what to think
do you know raphael?
no sir i don't believe i do
oh i have a message for him
yes sir
a black man gave me the message
i understand i've never seen anything like this on television
mr gardiner i have a telephone call for you sidney courtney the financial editor of the washington post
but not the only victim right?
thank you
would you care to take it sir?
oh mr gardiner i've been looking all over
oh yes
morton hull the producer of 'this evening' just called
yes i have seen that show on television
of course they would like you to appear on the show tonight the vice president was scheduled but he had to cancel and they asked if you would be interested
yes i would like to be on that show
fine they felt that since you had such close ties with the president you would be a splendid choice   can i help you? are you looking for something?
 won't you let us do something for you? your leg should be examined we could take you to a hospital
my father is a powerful man over the years he's used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain unpleasantries  i am a homosexual
there's no need for a hospital
i hope you're comfortable
yes i am
these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a todo over a simple little accident of course they can be very frightening and i must apologize for david he's never had an accident before
yes he's a very careful driver
 why yes he is is your leg feeling any better?
it's feeling better but it's still very sore
i see   say would you mind seeing our family doctor?
your family doctor?
yes my husband has been very ill his doctor and nurses are staying with us those hospitals can be so impersonal  why it might be hours before you are treated
how long are you planning to stay?
senator daddy must be thrilled
i agree
would you care for a drink?
i would like to watch television
oh by the way  i'm eve rand
may i ask your name?
my name is chance
pardon me was that mr chance?
no i'm a gardener
oh mr gardiner mr chauncey gardiner you're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you?
no eve i'm not related to basil and perdita
he is not shall we say wild about the idea he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet what do you think of that?
did you lose something?
yes i lost my remote control
 i'll feel so relieved after dr allenby examines your leg after that david can run you on home or to your office or wherever you'd prefer   is there anything special you would like to watch?
i can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events
yes
won't your injury prevent you from attending to business mr gardiner?
no it won't do that
 would you like us to notify anyone for you?
i hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you
oh i know exactly what you mean i sometimes enjoy puttering around myself such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles
i think you just blew "don't ask don't tell" out of the fucking water
chauncey i wanted to tell you how dreadful i feel about the accident today but that i'm delighted that you are staying with us
thank you eve  i like this house very much
 and ben is just mad about you  you've lifted his spirits so  it's just well it's just a real pleasure having you with us
ben is very ill eve  i've seen that before
yes i know chauncey
i like ben very much he reminds me of the old man
he does?
 why no i don't think so
 good night chauncey
chauncey
levi i don't know if you're familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one
hello eve
your leg must be getting better
yes it's feeling much better now
good i'm glad to hear that   how did you like meeting the president?
fine he's very nice
 chauncey last night you mentioned an old man that died
yes
was he a relative? or an intimate friend?
he was a very wealthy man he looked after me since i was young
oh i see your mentor perhaps?
you said you wanted to know what happened  i'm telling you the truth
forgive me chauncey  i didn't mean to pry you must have been very close to him
yes i was
i'm sorry   and what about louise? you mentioned that she had gone were you close to her also?
yes i liked louise very much she was his maid
oh his maid stupid me i thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with
oh no she brought me my meals
what is that?
our greenhouse
oh i like that very much
 i'm   i'm very grateful that you're here chauncey   with us 
what happened to "degrees"?
i'll be all right chauncey you go ahead with mrs aubrey
chauncey
hello eve
chauncey i just wanted to wish you well i know you'll be smashing
thank you eve
and benjamin sends along his best wishes
how is ben feeling?
he's tired chauncey  but he's going to watch you tonight we'll both be watching
that's good i like to watch too
 you don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase do you?
i didn't kill him 
no thank you
oh well we can fix up one of ben's for you tomorrow night sophie insists an black tie
i see
 good night chauncey
chauncey have you seen the papers?
no eve i don't read the papers
well it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the president's speech and your own comments from the 'this evening' show are quoted side by side with the president's
i like the president he is a very nice man
i know   so are you chauncey    do you mind my being here like this?
 you know chauncey i want us to be  i want us you and i to become close i want us to become very close you know?
maybe i shouldn't tell you that maybe i should tell you i wasn't scared at all but i was  enough to almost kill him
 i'm grateful to you chauncey i would have opened to you with a touch and you know that   but you're so strong  i can trust myself with you i'm glad chauncey  i'm glad that you showed so much restraint
yes eve i'm very glad that you didn't open
i know you are chauncey   you conquer a woman from within herself you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love
yes that could be true
i've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you chauncey you're so cool and detached  almost as if you were born to it
yes
chauncey this is mr dennis watson of the state department
chauncey where have you been? i was afraid you got bored and left or that you were with some mysterious woman
no i was with a man we went upstairs
upstairs? chauncey you're always involved in some sort of discussion
but you didn't
he was very ill i stayed with him for a while
i feel so close to you so safe with you chauncey   and benjamin understands that dearest he understands and accepts my feelings for you
yes eve ben is very wise
 come in chauncey  please come in
i just don't excite you at all i don't know what you want i don't know what you like
i like to watch
to watch? to watch me?
yes i like to watch
 is that all you want?   to watch me?
yes it's very good eve
he admitted it
dearest you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me and when you watch me my passion dissolves it you set me free i reveal myself to myself and i am drenched and purged
chauncey chauncey
oh chauncey darling where have you been? we thought we'd lost you  we've been looking all over
hello mr gardiner this is sid courtney washington post
hello sid
i'm sorry to disturb you mr gardiner i know you must be very busy
no i'm not busy
then i'll be brief i covered the president's speech at the financial institute today and since the post would like to be as exact as possible we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between mr rand the president and yourself
the president is a nice person i enjoyed it very much
good sir and so it seems did the president  but we would like to have some facts; such as uh what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation?
two weeks
why did he come back for you?
i think you should ask mr rand that
of course but since he is ill i'm taking the liberty of asking you
i see then one more quick question mr gardiner; since we at the post would like to uh  update our profile on you  what exactly is your business?
mr gardiner i'm morton hull the producer of 'this evening'
of course mr gardiner the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis
i see
do you realize mr gardiner that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
yes it's a very good show
can you see well?
yes very well thank you
okay i think that's it he rises and walks to the door
do you like it?
yes it's very tiny but it's good
 are you sure you like it?
yes i do it's very good
do you need a doctor? i could call robert
i don't want robert
i see
you must sit with us my friend we have much to discuss
i agree
regretfully mrs rand  i shall yield the pleasure of your company to others
somebody emptied a full clip into him 
i'm sorry we haven't met sooner mr gardiner i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your downtoearth philosophy i'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president   tell me mr gardiner just how serious is benjamin's illness? i did not want to upset mrs rand by discussing it in detail
ben is very ill
 mr gardiner i wish to be quite candid  considering the gravity of your economic situation shouldn't we the diplomats and you the businessman  get together more often?
yes i agree i think so too
to exchange our thoughts  what does a russian know about business? on the other hand what does an american know about diplomacy?
yes i understand
and i have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues  so why not a coming together? an interchange of opinion? we may find my friend that we are not so far from each other not so far
we are not far   our chairs almost touch
bravo bravo our chairs are indeed almost touching and we want to remain seated on them correct? we don't want them snatched from under us am i right? because if one goes the other goes and then  boom boom and we are both down before our time you see? and neither of us wants that do you agree?
i certainly do
you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar 
yes tell me mr gardiner  do you by any chance enjoy krylov's fables? i ask this because there is something there is something krylovian about you
do you think so? do you think so?
so you know your krylov in russian do you? mr gardiner i must confess i had suspected as much all along  i know an educated man when i meet one
oh good
yes it is very good
yes it is  would you tell me your name again please?
ho ho a dash of american humor vladimar skrapinov
yes i like that name very much
yes eve that would be good
we must speak again mr gardiner many times
how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten
welcome to rand memorial hospital mr gardiner
i feel very good in here
sure you do this ward is air tight i have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up
failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells not a damn thing they can do about it oh they can make me comfortable prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions and what makes my blood boil what little i have left that is mr gardiner  is that it's generally a young person's disease here i am getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease
 we're prisoners mr gardiner  we're prisoners of tubes and technology
i agree
 you will join us for dinner won't you mr gardiner?
yes i am very hungry
no thank you my house has been closed
oh when you say 'your house has been closed' you mean to say that your business was shut down?
epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer
yes shut down and locked by the attorneys
that's good mr gardiner or may i call you chauncey?
yes chauncey is fine
do we have a garden? hah tomorrow chauncey you will see our gardens
a gardener well put chauncey excellent isn't that what a businessman is? a gardener? a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands who waters it with the sweat from his own brow and who creates a place of value for his family and community? yes chauncey what a brilliant metaphor  yes indeed a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard
thank you ben the garden that i left was such a place everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands i planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow
bravo
but i don't have that any more   all that's left for me now is the room upstairs
it's a very pleasant room ben
no ben
is it the truth?
reluctant to speak eh chauncey? well i can understand that when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time just give it some thought work with the idea i'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days
i could give it some thought ben but my leg is very sore
chauncey up and around this morning are you?
yes ben my leg is not very sore
well that's good news my boy
you're looking much better today ben
hah it's all makeup chauncey i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i didn't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk
i understand
no one likes a dying man my boy  because few know what death is all we know is the terror of it but you're an exception chauncey  that's what i admire in you your marvelous balance you don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope  you're a truly peaceful man
yes when i was younger i had thoughts about public office but i found chauncey  that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen of course my wealth provided me with considerable influence but i've tried believe me not to misuse that power it's extremely important chauncey when one is in a position of eminence that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country the temptations are strong and i've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people i have tried to remain honest to myself
why did you tell us he shot everybody levi? you put him in for three murders the man saved your life 
i see ben
i think what my most insightful friend is saying mr president is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy
he's a decent fellow the president isn't he?
yes ben  he is
he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey  he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately  seldom if ever at all
 you know chauncey there's something about you you're direct you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly you don't play games with words to protect yourself i feel i can speak to you frankly you know what i was talking to you about last night?
no ben
oh sure you do the financial assistance program i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking i'd like you to meet with the members of the board we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time
i understand
and please chauncey  don't rush your decision i know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds? the guns went off i ran in childs shot me pike and mueller were dead and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun 
thank you ben
certainly ben
senator rowley's widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union i think it's rather obvious that robert won't allow me to attend so  would you go in my place and escort eve?
yes i would like to escort eve
 chauncey chauncey
 i'm about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel my boy
oh i see
let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey let me feel your strength  yes that's good i hope chauncey  i hope that you'll stay with eve take care of her watch over her she's a delicate flower chauncey
a flower
she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey there's much to be looked after
dunbar was running out the door? ohhhhhh see that's where i was confused because i thought you said nunez was running out the door
yes i would like to do that
we could do it now we can go upstairs   please it's time for us come upstairs
i like to watch
watch? you mean just watch me? doing it alone?
yes i like to watch very much
well if that's what you want then i want it too  we can go this way
i want to tell eve
tell eve? you mean mrs rand?
yes
mr gardiner i'm ronald stiegler of harvard books
i'd like to speak for himself okay?
no i said dunbar
hello ronald
mr gardiner my editors and i have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? something on your political philosophy what do you say?
i can't write
of course who can nowadays? i have trouble writing a post card to my children look we could give you a six figure advance provide you with the very best ghostwriter research assistants proof readers
i can't read
of course not no one has the time to read one glances at things watches television
yes i like to watch
sure you do no one reads listen book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days
may i help you mr gardiner?
yes i would like to go to rand memorial hospital
i believe your next line is "what are you trying to hide?"
 sir?
 did you wish to see someone sir?
yes i would like to see ben
mr chance i'm very pleased to meet you
 then you really are a gardener?
yes
your appearance doesn't suggest that at all mr chance
what about money?
some pictures?
yes of men and women
well?
how about taxes mr chance surely you must have paid taxes?
might you have a birth certificate mr chance?
i am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the old man's suits they all fit me very well i can also take his shirts shoes and coats
it is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style
good day mr chance
this is terrible sir   i hope you're not badly injured
can you walk? it's not broken is it?
i don't think we should call anyone just yet it may not even be all that serious
i agree
let's have a look do you mind?
dunbar will testify that you were
it's starting to swell is it painful?
please sir
i've never ridden in an automobile
i assure you sir david is a very careful driver please won't you let us take you?
 yes you can take me
 my suitcase
does it have a television?
no  but mr rand does have one with an electric motor that way he can get around by himself
how long do we stay in here?
 that is a very small room
something funny levi?
yes sir i guess that's true smallest room in the house
 hmmm elevator
 evening chance
 the old man is getting weaker chance
i see
 back up those stairs  damn that man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again
good morning louise
he's dead chance the old man's dead
 i see
must of happened durin' the night i don't know lord he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish i touched him just to see and you believe me chance  that's doin' more than i get paid to do then i just covered him up pulled the sheet over his head
jail if he's lucky the gas chamber if he's not 
yes i've seen that done
then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably he wasn't any too alert he just said 'yeah he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over' lord what a mornin'
dammit boy is that all you got to say? more gobbledegook?  that old man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you
yes louise i have seen it often it happens to old people
well ain't that the truth
oh lord chance  i don't know what i was expectin' from you i'm sorry for yellin' like i did no sir i just don't know what i was expectin'    i 'spose i'd better gather up some breakfast for you
yes i'm very hungry
well no more stewin' those prunes every mornin' that's somethin' i guess   what are you goin' to do now chance?
 well ain't you the gentleman this mornin'   gotta go now chance
yes
why?
mr gardiner how very nice to have you with us this evening
yes
i'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the vice president
you're welcome
i always find it surprising mr gardiner to find men like yourself who are working so intimately with the president yet manage to remain relatively unknown
yes that is surprising
 well your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on
i hope so
yes of course you know mr gardiner that i always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests i hope you don't object to that
no i don't object
how do you know?
fine then let's get started the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all and i would like to know if you agree with the president's view of the economy?
come now mr gardiner before his speech at the financial institute the president consulted with you and benjamin rand did he not?
yes i was there with ben
i know that mr gardiner
yes
well let me rephrase the question; the president compared the economy of this country to a garden and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow do you go along with this belief?
don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? the bad as well as the good?
well mr gardiner from the sound of our audience i'd say that your words are a most welcome respite from what we've been hearing from others
i'm sorry to say that our time is running short but before we close i'd like to ask one final question what sort of gardener sir would you be?
hello thomas i'm chance the gardener
or you levi? when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him?
 we're with franklin jennings and roberts the law firm handling the estate
 are you waiting for someone? an appointment?
yes i'm waiting for my lunch
your lunch? you have a luncheon appointment here?
yes louise will bring me lunch
louise? the maid?  but she should have left earlier today
i see
 you've quite a sense of humor mr chance  but all kidding aside may i ask just what you are doing here?
i live here
you live here?   we don't have any record of that
i didn't 
yes it's very cold outside today isn't it thomas?
 how long have you been living here?
ever since i can remember since i was a child
since you were a child?
do you have any proof of your employment mr chance  any checks from the deceased any contracts or documents?
no
how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
compensated?
how were you paid?
mr chance perhaps you could show us some identification with your address  a driver's license a credit card checkbook?
who is he?
you lied to us levi you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them
no i do not have any of those
then how about medical records? could you give us the name of your doctor or your dentist?
i have no need for a doctor or dentist i have never been ill i have never been allowed outside of this house and except for joe i have never had any visitors
 joe? who's joe?
joe saracini he was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house that was in 1952
1952?
mr chance that was twentyseven years ago
yes and the old man used to come to my garden he would read and rest there
come now mr jennings had been bedridden for thirtyfive years since he fractured his spine
yes thomas that is correct then he stopped visiting my garden
i don't know 
 we shall need some proof of your having resided here mr chance
have you served in the army?
those trees were very young when i first arrived
are you related to the deceased mr chance?
 do you drive this mr chance?
the old man gave me nice television sets this one has remote control  he has one just like it
mr chance the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased
what are your plans now mr chance?
mr chance assuming what you say is the truth i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate
i'm fine thomas the garden is a healthy one there is no need for a claim
where are they
no thomas i don't know how to sign
come now mr chance
i have no claim thomas
but you won't sign correct?
correct
very well mr chance  if you insist on dragging this matter on but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon if indeed you do reside here you will have to move out
move out? i don't understand thomas
good morning mr president
you look much taller on television mr president
well mr gardiner that's just fine with me  i'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion be seated please mr gardiner
maybe 
yes i will
do you agree with ben mr gardiner? are we finished? or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
as long as the roots are not severed all is well and all will be well in the garden
 in the garden?
that is correct in a garden growth has its season there is spring and summer but there is also fall and winter and then spring and summer again
yes it has
 you will honor me and my family with a visit won't you?
yes i will
 gardiner is laconic matterof fact the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man we're going to need facts on his background   kinney what did you come up with?
 nothing
maybe what 
 skip the levity kinney  what have you got?
 sid be reasonable  i've been everywhere there's no place left to check
try again
sure try again  where? there's nothing it's like he never existed
try again
sid it's useless
oh ben  i miss you so when i'm out how are you feeling?
tired and i'm getting tired of being so tired other than that i'm doing very well
no headaches?
no it's been a good day  better than yours from what i've been told
how are you?
you heard?
i may be a shutin but i do not lack for news i'm sorry you had to go through all that
oh it wasn't all that bad darling we were fortunate that mr gardiner turned out to be so reasonable
reasonable? good i'd like to meet a reasonable man why don't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner?
do you feel well enough for that?
oh i'm very sorry well if you have any need for any of our facilities please do not hesitate to ask
i'm becoming quite attached to chauncey  quite attached   and so are you aren't you eve
 yes i am ben
 ben really
good evening mrs rand
been better  i read about what's been happening with you i should have called 
good evening wilson
i shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite ma'am dr allenby is standing by
thank you greta  i'll be with mr rand if i'm needed
yes ma'am
eve child how nice of you to come
and look who you brought with
sophie this is chauncey gardiner
oh i've been just dying to meet you mr gardiner
come on eve let's let the men talk there are so many people that have been asking about you
 how are the kids getting along?
that bad?
oh well i just talked to cindy this morning she loves california but to quote her she says 'the secret service is getting to be a drag' i guess she wants her privacy
huh i'm glad they're along with her if you know what i mean how about jack?
well i think jack needs some time alone with you darling he's getting to that age you know he really misses you
 maybe you should talk to somebody darling
no that won't do any good
 is it me? is there something i've done?
oh no sweetheart  it's not you
it's your damn job it never happened when you were a senator
i can certainly understand that
 this is another world tom  i never would have believed it
would i have called you if it wasn't? if there was any other way 
yeah he and my father used to ride together back in the thirties fox hunting before i was born
 would you take me on a tour?
 what do you make of all this?
i really don't know tom  he seems so honest and simple in a way he's quite charming
 yeah
 it's very bizarre  i don't know what to think
it's that gardener
yes chauncey gardiner
no he's a real gardener
 business bullshit going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar
this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator
sally hayes is not a bitch  she's a damn fine attorney i've got to talk to her about this gardiner
good night
look johanna
yes? what have you found?
we have nothing on him ambassador skrapinov
quietly please mr gardiner for one understands our language
sorry comrade ambassador
what do you mean there is nothing? that's impossible
but where was this man gardiner before last week?
apparently the white house shares our curiosity  they have also launched an investigation and according to our sources neither the fbi nor the cia has met with success
this all you want?
the official term for it is "clusterfuck" by the time beth hit us i'd canceled all off base exercises save one  a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush we're missing three and the sergeant the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names but the sergeant
i see clearly such interest on their part is of great political significance
clearly yes comrade
hmmm take this down  i want this quote included in the tass coverage; 'chauncey gardiner in an intimate discussion with ambassador skrapinov noted that "unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes"'
kaufman i'm going to need information on mr chauncey gardiner's background
gardiner yes sir
and put it through on a code red  i want it as soon as possible
 gentlemen i quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown
yes sir  we are aware of all that but still we haven't been able to
he's an advisor and close personal friend of rand's for christ sakes they have volumes of data on benjamin
yes mr president we attempted to contact mr rand but he was too ill to
a few years ago the army picked our good buddy as their go to noncom to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder gentler military he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country
i do not want benjamin rand disturbed you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of chauncey gardiner if you run into problems alert honeycutt  i'll be in the office at seven in the morning and i would like to have it at that time  i've got to take a leak
this is not what i requested
no sir
this information goes back three days i want the standard file you know that
right chief
so? where the hell is it?
we uh have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at mr rand's home  and uh
what the hell are you talking about kaufman?
well we do have data from honeycutt's sources chief  but it isn't pertinent
i'd like to hear that data kaufman
the exercise was one of his section eight "private sessions" left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning
 so what does all that add up to?
well sir  it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power but we ruled that out as they invariably are provided with too much documentation too much american identity we uhdon't quite know what to make of it yet sir but we'll keep on top of it mr president  we'll come up with the answer
sorry to disturb you chief but we have new developments
oh? what?
we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiner's background so far they haven't come up with a thing  what's more as a result of their eagerness one of their ablest agents blew his cover we have him in custody at this time
good anything else?
the rankandfile in the fbi feel he is fbi but others feel he is a cia man who knows how to destroy fbi files
that could be possible
but we are quite certain comrade that this man gardiner is a leading member of an american elitist faction planning a coup d'etat
a coup d'etat of course that was foreseen by lenin himself
and the problem is you only got three
that is correct comrade skrapinov we have ascertained that gardiner heads a bigbusiness power group that will soon be taking over the american government
big business i could work with that faction quite nicely colonel novogrod
you have proven that already comrade skrapinov you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship
thank you colonel
ben
 mr president how good to see you
it's so good to see you too ben you look terrific
i'm not convinced of that mr president but your visit has raised my spirits
mr president i'd like you to meet my dear friend mr chauncey gardiner
i just wondered if you had gone over my speech ben
no the problem is one's dead one's got a bullet in his arm and one won't talk the one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup
yes i did
 well?
overall  pretty good but mr president i think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game
well ben i
i sympathize with your position mr president i know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos
 there is no longer any margin for inflation it has gone as far as it can you've reached your limits on taxation dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis and from where i see it mr president the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible
it's that serious huh?
no she flew up to boston for another charity event she'll be sorry to have missed you
i'm sorry too well nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you  and ben i want to thank you for your time and thoughts
nonsense mr president  i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man
i'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
you're right mr president i don't like feeling sorry for myself
take care of yourself ben
you take care too bobby
john great to see you sorry about the cunt at reception
i'll get right to the point larry i'm a puppet now

who killed pike?
brain soul i'm telling you lotte i was right inside him looking out we're going to be rich
i want to try

you weren't you you were john malkovich
i was wasn't i?  i was john fucking malkovich  take me back craig
lotte why aren't you at the pet shop?
why aren't you at work?
i've been going over and over my experience last night it was amazing  i've decided i'm a transsexual isn't that the craziest thing?
what are you nuts? that's oprah talking
everything felt right for the first time i need to go back to make sure then if the feeling is still there i'm going to speak to dr feldman about sexual reassignment surgery
how was it?
i have to go back tonight at eight exactly
there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it
why?
so how was it? what was he doing?
oh you know not a lot just hanging around his apartment i think he must be a lonely man
you see men can feel unfulfilled too i'm glad you're realizing that you shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems
you're right you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner since you two are partners and all it might be a nice gesture
did you know that eskimos have not one but fifty words for snow it's because they have so much of it
what are you doing?
i'm moving remember? what's with the hooded cloak?
nothing don't go craig i've been thinking let's try to work this out we've got so much history
you should feed your animals they're looking peaked
habeas corpus  you have to have a body to have a crime
i'm getting rid of the fucking animals
what?
i'm getting rid of the animals i've lost interest besides they're standing between you and me
no they're not
you've always hated the animals
you've always loved the animals
i'm giving them up i've changed i've found a new focus
what's that?
what about maxine?
fuck maxine
okay then let's widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car 
you were him last night weren't you?
yes
and he was with her
we love her craig i'm sorry
we?
me and john
don't forget me
i'm sorry that was nasty
life is confusing isn't it?
sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions  i'd like for us to stay together craig you know platonically if that's possible i truly value our friendship
without the body we have no physical proof we need a confession
i'm your goddamn wife once you vowed to cherish me forever now you hold a gun to my head?
yeah well welcome to the nineties
suck my dick
tell her you need to see her
tell her what the hell close early today live dangerously
it was lovely being you being malkovich my dear i'd never seen the passionate side of sweet maxine before or her actual tits for that matter if only i've been thinking to myself if only i could actually feel what malkovich feels rather than just see what he sees and then dare i say it if only i could control his arms his legs his pelvis and make them do my bidding
it'll never happen fuckface
ah but you're forgetting one thing lambchop
what's that?
once this was a relationship based on love now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head
from dunbar? i hate to break this to you but i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty
things change anyway you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine
you fell in love with her first
yeah but i didn't do anything about it out of respect for our marriage
you didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole which is by the way about nine feet nine inches off the mark anyway
that's true oh god lotte what have i become? my wife in a cage with a monkey a gun in my hand betrayal in my heart
maybe this is what you've always been craig you just never faced it before
perhaps you're right i can't let you go though too much has happened you're my ace in the hole
i need a shower
i'm sorry oh god i'm sorry i'm some kind of monster i'm the guy you read about in the paper and go "he's some kind of monster"
you're not a monster craig just a confused man
nevertheless 
my god
i'm so glad you're safe you look really wonderful
i'm in love for the first time it's funny but when it happens to you there's no question
he's a lucky man  do i know him?
it's elijah
the iguana?
the monkey
oh right as long as you're happy i'm sure he's a better lover than i ever was
a better friend
i'm sorry for everything
nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough
it's okay craig it all worked out in an odd sort of way
you came up here looking for the portal?
yeah i was going to kill him from the inside
and yourself too in the process god you're so beautiful why couldn't i see that before?
you saw it once now you see it again that's life isn't it? and you were up here to try the same thing weren't you?
i suppose but they got here first the lousy bastards so now it's all over i guess
i don't know there's a small community of us we have a place they don't know about we're happy we'll keep trying to figure out a way come stay with us join the struggle
you'll have me after all i've done to you?
people make mistakes
i'm through with puppets lotte i just want you to know that
let go
in here says he wants a million
you mean not enough to save you
i know
i'd like to be a farmer i want to help things grow to encourage life do you and your friends need a farmer?
maxine
holy shit yes
holy shit yes
holy shit he said what i said
mr malkovich my name is craig schwartz i can explain we operate a little business her that simulates for our clientele the experience of being you actually
simulates?
sure after a fashion
let me try
tom where are you going 
you? why i'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience
so how was it?
that was no simulation
i know i'm sorry
i have been to the dark side i have seen a world that no man should ever see
really? for most people it's a rather pleasant experience what exactly did you
this portal is mine and must be sealed up forever for the love of god
with all respect sir i discovered that portal its my livelihood
welcome to lestercorp may we meet your filing needs?
no uh my name is craig schwartz i have an interview with mr lester
home i'm done
please have a seat mr juarez
schwartz
pardon?
schwartz
i'm sorry i'm afraid i have no idea what you're saying right now
my name is schwartz
money miss warts?
mr juarez?
yes?
yex?
you want a confession? why don't you confess bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault 
i said "yes"
you're not like the other boys we've had here granted i can't understand what you're saying either but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis
i am a trained performer
come in mr juarez i'd stand but well you know
security
not at all dr lester i simply misspoke
tell me dr schwartz what do you feel you can bring to lestercorp?
well sir i'm an excellent filer
you think so eh? which comes first l or glooph?
glooph is not a letter sir
what the hell are you talking about 
you don't have a speech impediment dr lester
flattery will get you everywhere my boy but i'm afraid i have to trust floris on this one you see she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western perhaps you've read her memoirs "i can't understand a word any of you are saying"
no
pity it tells it like it is that's why the eastern read jewish publishing establishment won't touch it that's a quote from the book jacket george will i think  i apologize if you can't understan a word i'm saying dr schwartz
no i understand perfectly
thank you for being kind enough to lie you see i've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech you're hired any questions?
just one why is this floor so short?
don't toy with floris schwartz why if i were eighty years younger i'd box your ears
i wasn't toying with her sir i was just how old are you?
one hundred and five carrot juice  lot's of it i swear it's almost not worth it i piss orange oh and i have to piss sitting down like a godamn girly every fifteen minutes but nobody wants to die schwartz
what i said before 
i'll keep that in mind sir
no sirebob i don't die but what i do is get older wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you oh to be a young man again maybe then floris would care for me
the elderly have so much to offer sir they are our link with history
i don't want to be your godamn link damn you i want to feel floris' naked thighs against my own i want to know passion i want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful complex woman i want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when i penetrate her oh god the agony of the flesh schwartz
dr lester while i am flattered that you share your feelings with me i believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion
dr lester it's been really fascinating but i'm afraid i have to get home to my wife now
wife huh? i'd love to meet her craig
yessir
shall we say dinner on friday just the two of us?  you can come too if you like schwartz
dr lester  
was dead right you think dunbar's on the level?
ah craig just the fellow i wanted to see  juicer easy as pie just keep your fingers clear of the blade and never never use it while bathing in a tub full of water
dr lester i have a question i was in that vacant office down the hall and i stumbled upon a little door and
ah yes the little door  there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes if you hurry you'll just make it
dr lester
more beetspinach juice my friend?
no thank you sir it's delicious though i just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at lestercorp but i'm afraid i'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately
i see are you unhappy at our little company?
no sir not at all it's just that i'm going to open my own business and
and what sort of business will this be? if you don't mind my asking
you're making a big mistake schwartz  ma'am
yeah
dr lester i don't know what you're talking about
there are rules boy procedures etiquette this is not a toy i've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room grooming myself quietly setting the stage performing ablutions paying tribute seeing all his motion pictures again and again worshipping schwartz worshipping properly
you're insane
moving story
yes unfortunately it's bullshit the real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors
is that true?
well truth is for suckers isn't it?
listen i'm craig schwartz just starting out at lestercorp
how dreary  to be  somebody / how public  like a frog / to tell one's name  the livelong june / to an admiring bog
emily dickinson
it's over time of death was 4:42 jag's been notified and i called the senator myself my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable you two had no culpability in the matter

you're a fag or a liar
i mean i am really attracted to you
no wait i like your tits  i love your tits i want to fuck you
so tell me about yourself if you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough dogboy
hi
you're not someone i could get interested in craig you play with dolls
they're taking your command aren't they?
puppets maxine it's the idea of being inside someone else feeling what they feel seeing what they see
yikes
it's just and i've never done this before maxine but it's just that i feel something for you i've never felt this before for anyone not even my wife my future is with you maxine
don't you want to know what happened to me?
this is important
there's a tiny door in that empty office it's a portal maxine it takes you inside john malkovich you see the world through john malkovich's eyes then after about fifteen minutes you're spit out into a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike
sounds delightful who the fuck is john malkovich?
he's an actor one of the great american actors of the 20th century
what's he been in?
lots of things he's very well respected that jewel thief movie for example the point is that this is a very odd thing supernatural for lack of a better word it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self about the existence of the soul am i me? is malkovich malkovich? was the buddha right is duality an illusion? do you see what a can of worms this portal is? i don't think i can go on living my life as i have lived it there's only one thing to do let's get married right away
i'm sorry bill
is this malkovich fellow appealing?
yes of course he's a celebrity
good we'll sell tickets
tickets to malkovich?
exactly two hundred dollars a pop
but there's something profound here maxine we can't exploit it
fine i'll do it myself i was going to offer a partnership to you but this way it's more money for me
you wanted to be partners with me?
sure it'd be fun
really?  but maxine can of worms end of the world illusory nature of existence
don't be i'm not cut out to deal with the west's of the world
okay here it is  ever want to be someone else? now you can no kidding only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes visit jm inc mertinflemmer building etc etc
craig i just don't find you attractive and lotte i'm smitten with you but only when you're in malkovich when i looked into his eyes last night i could feel you peering out behind the stubble and the tooprominent brow and the male pattern baldness i sensed your feminine longing peering out and it just slew me
this is amazing we're gonna be rich
you're late
are you torturing me on purpose?
i've fallen in love
i don't think so i've fallen in love this is what people who've fallen in love look like
you picked the unrequited variety very bad for the skin
you're evil maxine
you're glowing again
you're a good soldier bill
lotte this is so good
lotte? is that you?
let him try
what happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
but i gotta go now i've got to go be johnny
hello don
hello wendy
don i was wondering do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
so that's the story of 7 1/2 since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners after all the overhead is low ha ha ha
you've got to tell craig what's going on he must never leave malkovich
it was so good i actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now the base commander the one in control you couldn't let him testify could you?
i'm glad you learned sign language elijah but i'm tired of your nagging i'm tired of this conversation i'm tired period what has the world ever done for me that i should feel personally responsible for saving it?
must you take this terrible demon on yourself my love?
yes i'm the only one i have to enter malkovich and destroy him from the inside if not me who?
if there was any way i could go in your place but i'm only a monkey and
i'll be with you always my friends who knows maybe if i'm lucky i'll rejoin you with wings and a beak
no
long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
no don't be an ass
can i be anyone i want?
you can be john malkovich
what are you talking about?
well that's perfect my second choice ah this is wonderful too good to be true you see i'm a sad man sad and fat and alone oh i've tried all the diets my friends lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise did it work? you be the judge but malkovich king of new york man about town most eligible bachelor bon vivant the schopenhauer of the 20th century thin man extraordinaire
two hundred dollars please
boy this is a toughie to be honest i didn't anticipate this
and as i said sir we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich
right lester i heard you the first time i'm not a dummy
didn't mean to imply that you were sir
have a seat i wracking my brain over this malkovich thing
we saw his show at the luxor last night
vegas? what'd you think?
the kid's got talent you've never seen malkovich like this schwartz had him up there singing and dancing impressions
if you let him testify then it would have all come out west was supposed to take care of it out there shut nunez up and then disappear but it got messy and people got killed so you called your old pal tom hardy figuring if worse came to worse he'd cover for you
impressions? those are hard
very talented son of a bitch too bad we can't kill him
i suppose i could come to him in a dream i don't know that's the best i can think of right now
a scary dream?
no a sexy dream of course a scary dream
how'd it go? did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
no for god's sake i just watered it yesterday  it almost went well i gave a pretty good dream but circumstances arose
what kind of circumstances?
maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves malkovich plus he's been challenged to a puppetduel by mantini
the great mantini?
you're drunk 
no the mediocre mantini of course the great mantini
oh he's good great actually i saw him do "tru" with his sixty foot robert morse puppet sensational
but i think i have another plan
do tell i love a good plan
i missed you i'm sorry tell me the plan
well if mantini wins schwartz will leave malkovich right? so if he needs it i help mantini's performance a bit give him an edge spice up the show
can you do that? i mean do you know anything about puppetry?
i am the devil lester i think i can handle it
i was just asking no disrespect intended
fine let's drop it
stay where you are
fine i mean it's not like i was doubting you it's just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire
fine i'm not mad let's just drop it
floris get guinness on the phone
gehginnis ondah foam?
forget it
fork ah did?
yes my dear?
someone names a lot of warts on line two
thank you floris
think jew florist?
hey tabloids paid ted bundy  famous serial killer  half a million for his interview  and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her?  it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country look you want magazine or not?
or what? you've gone round the bend 
do you dream often?
do you?
it's my job to ask the questions yours to answer them
says who?
says me do you dream often?
it's like nothing i've ever felt before i think i'm going crazy
i'm sure you're not going crazy
kevin i'm telling you it was like nothing i've
yeah yeah yeah yadda yadda yadda were you stoned?
yes but you see someone else was talking through my mouth
what i can't understand is why you signed these if you'd just let west take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too
you were stoned case closed end of story how hot is this babe?
i think it might've been this lotte woman talking through me maxine likes to call me lotte
ouch now that's hot she's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover let me know when you're done with her this is my type of chick
i'm done with her now tonight really creeped me out
you're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you lotte i tell you that as a friend
i don't know anything about her what if she's some sort of witch or something?
all the better hey hot lesbian witches next geraldo buddy boy ha ha ha
i gotta know the truth kevin
you don't look a day over one hundred and five captain what's your secret?
anybody else?
that's preposterous 
do we get to wear a crown?
but of course
count me in
tell me lotte can you understand a word i'm saying?
yes of course dr lester
oh be still my heart
dr lester would you point me toward the restroom?
i'm getting divorced
no you mustn't my child
but why son of malkovich?
toxicology report came back kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe you've heard of it it's for asthmatics if an epileptic takes enough it kills them i checked with the nurses at the hospital  you're the only other person who visited kendall
i blew it dr lester
you followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing
but now we've lost access to craig
you know i think it pays to leave juicemaking to the trained professionals you look terrible my dear
craig stole maxine from me dr lester
hmmm a lesbian are you? i must inform you that i find that highly arousing
no you don't understand i've been inside malkovich when i'm with maxine
what? that is not allowed my god you are supposed to be one of us you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself
no i didn't know that
oh didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
i wanted to see if he was okay 
no
aaaahhhh the portal
no don't harm the vessel
it's craig in there i can tell
thank you all for your efforts but i'm afraid we can no longer get into malkovich through the portal
why not? i need to get in there
i'm not certain my dear but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route
that bastard i'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich
yes hello i wanted to place an ad  hi are you craig's wife?
hi have you done malkovich yet?
you poisoned him bill you heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like pike
and the funny thing is mr malkovich my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me
ah
yes?
i have to see you can you call him and invite us over?
when?
oh my darling oh my sweetheart
i love you lotte
jm inc be all that someone else can be
i have to see you
we have to meet
i'm not even going to dignify that 
maxine listen:  it hasn't been me in john the last three times craig's had me locked up in the apartment he made me call you at gunpoint it's been him oh god it's been him
really? well you know he's quite good i'm surprised anyway i have a session with malkovich i have to attend i'll speak with you soon
but maxine i thought it was me you loved
hello schwartz i saw your show
did you see the reviews?
yeah i saw them
she's not available
how do we do that?
a friendly competition if you will your malkovich puppet and my harry s truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play not some vegas burlyq pyrotechnics but a real play that requires actual acting the audience decides who is more deserving of the title the losing puppeteer bows out graciously goes back to obscurity as a file clerk
what's the play?
no you will stand there and you will listen what happened to you bill? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world you were the one who believed in it 
say "equus"? it's got everything
never heard of it
broadway's finest three hours it's about the suppression of the individual conformity as god in modern society
sounds boring are there any songs?
nothing but acting to hide behind buddyboy
i'm not afraid i toured for a year with the national puppet company's production of "long day's journey into night"
great then
is there dancing?
no
yeah?
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? the army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? there's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you
mr malkovich?
who's calling?
you don't know me but i'm a great admirer of yours
how'd you get this number?
can i get you a drink?
thanks so much for coming over
so do you enjoy being an actor?
i'm sorry did you just call me "lotte"?
do you mind?
oh my sweet beautiful lotte
no more witnesses west's a ghost but it doesn't matter because we have your signature the hospital log and kendall's toxicology report and that'll be enough
yes yes sweetheart yes  what the fuck is going on? i'm not talking this is not me
something was making me talk some goddamn thing was making me move i gotta get out of here
oh dollface it was just your passion for me taking hold
darling
come on in
i can explain about the portal darling
don't con me maxine we're over i just let you up here to tell you that and to tell you that i'm taking you and schwartz to court
yes how did you know it was me?
lotte called me
oh so the bitch escaped
just do what i do  say the same thing i say  don't open your mouth
you're crazy 
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now
i'm getting better all the time
i'll say you are let's do it on his kitchen table then make him eat an omelette off of it
you still there sweets?
yeah i've figured out how to hold on as long as i want oddly enough it's all in the wrists
wow  do a puppet show for me craig honey
you mean with malkovich?
i'd love to see your work
that was incredible you're brilliant
you see maxine it isn't just playing with dolls
you can't duck this bill i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen
stay in him forever?
no  but how will we make a living my love if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
well we'll have all the money in malkovich's bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally
no please  shut up will you? we're trying to think here  it is sort of like being a puppeteer i like that about it
no one would ever have to know its not him
wait a minute what if everybody knew? what if we presented malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? we'd wipe the floor with the great mantini
shut up  sorry dear i lost control for a minute
vegas
this is it lover you're stepping onto that stage a nobody and prestochangeo you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen
doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
for the last time i have no idea what you're talking about 
they love me darling "craig schwartz is fantastic"  the new york times "if only craig schwartz had always been inside malkovich"  women's wear daily "craig schwartz  the world's greatest puppeteer"  paul wunder wbai radio
oh darling it's a dream come true we're going to ride this straight to the top
sleepy suddenly
bad dream darling?
i've got to leave malkovich
you've got to be kidding
honey we can be happy and poor together
yeah what?
goodbye maxine
captain mertin?
hostile and uncooperative
what want ye girl child?
i am not a child captain mertin but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions
i see well it is not my fault that thou art tiny so if it is charity yer after then be gone with ye ye foul demon

i did down to the cent$900 always wondered though what mrs garner got for my brother paul f must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years but then they hung my other brother paul a up on a tree so i guess he wasn't worth the samei wonder what was baby suggs worth? and halle? i wasn't surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti her price must have been higher than all of us  her being property that reproduced itself without cost a breeder
no use thinking these things now
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which doesn't exactly put people at ease is he cute?
oh but we got to how we gonna know our price in the future? how are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? who's gonna tell them? what are they gonna pay for us if we free?

in a sense yes  elfranco my robe my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal  which bothers some men  the word itself makes some men uncomfortable  vagina
oh yeah?
yes they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say  whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson"
"johnson"?
huh?
yes i know about it  and i know that you acted as courier  and let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven
right but let me explain something about that rug
do you like sex mr lebowski?
excuse me?
why?  why do i always have to speak to you in czech?
he's telling the truth up to a point
sex  the physical act of love coitus  do you like it?
i was talking about my rug
you're not interested in sex?
you mean coitus?
i like it too  it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex it can be a natural zesty enterprise but unfortunately there are some peopleit is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in womenwho engage in it compulsively and without joy
oh no
yes mr lebowski these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word  our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these
listen maude i'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho but i don't see what it has to do withdo you have any kalhua?
lord  you can imagine where it goes from here
he fixes the cable?
something wrong?
shit yeah the achievers
yeah but my
i'm getting to your rug my  father and i don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and needless to say i don't approve of his still i hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter so i'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to
wellsure i could do that
if you successfully do so i will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum
a hundred
thousand yes bones or clams or whatever you call them
yeah but what about
oh that's okay i hardly even
here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you  you will receive no bill  he's a good man and thorough
being back here gives me the willies
that's really thoughtful but i
jeffrey you haven't gone to the doctor
no it's fine really uh
do you have any news regarding my father's money?
i uh money yeah i gotta respecfully 69 you know tender my resignation on that matter 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all
she most certainly was not
hey man why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  you might learn something  now i got
and please don't call her my mother
now i got
she is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim
remember he's the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves
i'm telling you i got definitive evidence
from who?
the main guy dieter
dieter hauff?
wellyeah i guess
her "costar" in the beaver picture?
beaver?  you mean vagina?i mean you know him?
roy orbison   pink floyd
jeez  i miss vinyl
is he pretending to be the abductor?
that was kid gloves?
wellyeah
look jeffrey you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with  you can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are
well yeahi know that
so dieter has the money?
well no not exactly  it's a complicated case maude  lotta ins lotta outs  and a lotta strands to keep in my head man  lotta strands in old duder's
do you still have that doctor's number?
please jeffrey  i don't want to be responsible for any delayed after effects
delayed aftereff
jeffrey
tell me a little about yourself jeffrey
but we have to question him   thought you didn't have cigarettes 
i was uh one of the authors of the port huron statementthe original port huron statement
uhhuh
not the compromised second draft and then i uh   ever hear of the seattle seven?
and then   let's see i uhmusic business briefly
oh?
yeah  roadie for metallica  speed of sound tour
uhhuh
bunch of assholes  and then you know little of this little of that my career's uh slowed down a bit lately
what do you do for fun?
what happened to your house?
"too neat" how long have you been an investigator?
jackie treehorn trashed the place wanted to save the finder's fee
finder's fee?
he thought i had your father's money so he got me out of the way while he looked for it
it's not my father's money it's the foundation's  why did he think you had it?  and who does?
jeffrey
it's a complicated case maude lotta ins lotta outs  fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict uh drug regimen to keep my mind you know limber  i'm real fucking close to your father's money real fucking close  it's just
i keep telling you it's the foundation's money  father doesn't have any
huh?  he's fucking loaded
no no the wealth was all mother's
but your fatherhe runs stuff he
i don't think that has anything to do with 
we did let father run one of the companies briefly but he didn't do very well at it
but he's
he helps administer the charities now and i give him a reasonable allowance  he has no money of his own  i know how he likes to present himself; father's weakness is vanity hence the slut
increases?
well yes what did you think this was all about?  fun and games?
wellno of course not
i want a child
yeah okay but see the dude
look jeffrey i don't want a partner in fact i don't want the father to be someone i have to see socially or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself
sothat doctor
i just he came back for kendall i don't think he's capable of murder
no the uh police chief of malibu a real reactionary   so your father   oh man i get it
this was uh
yeah man it really tied the room together
what's your point walter?
what's the point ofwe all know who was at fault so what the fuck are you talking about?
forget it donny  you're out of your element
this chinaman who peed on my rug i can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
what the fuck are you talking about? this chinaman is not the issue  i'm talking about drawing a line in the sand dude  across this line you do not uhand also dude chinaman is not the preferred uh   asian american  please
walter this is not a guy who built the rail roads here this is a guy who peed on my
what the fuck are you
look all we've got is what kendall says and he didn't actually witness any deaths except nunez he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies  he didn't see any crime committed
so who
jeff lebowski  come on  this other jeffrey lebowski  the millionaire he's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two uh these two     and he has the wealth uh the resources obviously and there is no reason no fucking reason why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug  am i wrong?
