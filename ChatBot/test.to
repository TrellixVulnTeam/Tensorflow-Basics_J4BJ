it's in your closet
i've worn some kinky stuff before

well if i don't who will?
they're happy like this
david nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set  you like all this don't you?
i just don't think we have the right to 
david let me tell you something these people don't want to be geeks they want to be "attractive" they've got a lot of potential they just don't know any better
they don't have that kind of potential

i'll be honest with you bud i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these reruns 
reruns?
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey   those aren't your cookies bud
you'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend cousin  cole younger's going to make everybody rich

bud
terrific i'll talk to you then
ohwell 
now
what do i mean  you think this is a toy? you think it's your own little goddamn coloring book 
lookit just sort of "happened" 
a deluge doesn't just "happen" bolts of lightning don't just "happen"   you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake 
we don't need to know
a trap
i had nothing to do with that
oh i'm sorryrefresh my memory what episode does the orgy happen in again?
look 
it was a gift bud it was so special you liked these things as much as i did remember: warm smells in the family kitchen? a smile from a stranger? you know how rare that is?
 only if they mean it
i didn't do anything wrong
oh no? let me show you something
why?
because you're coming home i'm gonna put this place back the way it was
no you're not
clell tom go get doc mimms in liberty

i am actually  glad to see you've finally shown your true colors
why?
because you're coming home

oh you're a smart little bastard aren't you?  it's kind of like a restricted ticket you gotta leave the same way you came
pass me some whisky
just gimme the damn remote
i'm sorry i can't do that
they weren't my memories  i borrowed them it's no good when you borrow them
i don't know  three four weeks
much less than that  an hour and a half
i'm going on trial tomorrow?

oh sure for the first hundred years then it starts to get a little monotonous  sleep well
sorry  i had to help my folks and then i couldn't find my hat

i'm out
welli always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries 
yeah

yeah 
you know how when we close up i close the register then you lower the shades then i turn out the lights then we both lock the doors
yeah 
well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself
there aren't any cheeseburgers
look i thought we talked about this i thought we said 
who's next? you? me? bob?
ohwhat's the point bud?
what are you talking about you make hamburgers that is the point
no i know  i know i do   but it's always the same you know? grill the bun flip the meat melt the cheese  it never changes it never gets any better or worse 
just listen to me 
 like the other night when i closed up by myself that was different 
forget about that
oh  okay   but i really liked it
why?
so they can have their hamburgers
 what's that?
missed you too cousin
christmastime
thanks  but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year and then i thought "gee that seems awfully silly that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment don't you think?"
i think you should try not to think about this anymore
really?
yeah
oh okay i'll try that then
hi
aren't you a little early?
i brought you something  from the library
oh my gosh bud 
pff all we been through the thought never crossed my mind

tv repair?

remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
oh sure big fan like yourself it's the least i could do
what happened?
a miracle
this isn't funny i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes
well you don't have to worry about that anymore
you pay me to find you bluecoats there they are
you knowthis is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation
hey
yeah  saw you too
yeah 
cool
cool
hey it's me what are you doing?
hello karen i'm just working
yeah but what are you doing?
i'm just workingi have some customers here
you're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class
we came here to stay  to build not to start a crusade  in this forest there is enough danger to sweep us away in days  so we will be brave and swallow our grief  and in the name of those who died we will accomplish what we came for
you ride like a comanche
so you can't talk to me?
i have a few people here i can't really chat right now
"chat?" did you just say "chat?"
well i can't talk though 
you just fucking said "chat" that is so  what are you now? "chat" i'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight
yes i'll be there
fine you get back to chatting with your precious customers
ok byebye
no no no
well it's just not true we wouldn't be looking at you  why are you wearing this suit? did you say hello to your brother in law's?
hmm go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack or work for you
and what was this?
i'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
this is "fly with us?"
it's hard to understand because it says in addition to but i can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too
i think that's a typeo then that would be a mistake
so just to clarify i'm sorry: ten purchases of any of your healthy choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles 
that's it
do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
i don't knowi mean: i don't know
ok thank you
well?
somewhere in utah
what's the listing?
d&d mattress man

yeah not really
i saw a picture of you
yes lena elizabeth has a picture of you guys  your sisters and you it's a lot of family it must be nice
do you have brothers or sisters?
no i'm the exact opposite 
that must be nice that must be really really really great
all right all right  jesse james never yelled at folk
it's terrible no
that's not mine it's one of the guys that works here that pudding's not mine
it's ok that's ok how long have you worked with elizabeth?
are you guys hurt?
really?
i was yeah i was thinking about going there for business 
 well if you're gonna go 
 i'm probably not gonna go though
 oh that's too bad it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something 
 yeah that would be great if i was gonna go but i'm not exactly sure i have so much goin on here  a lot depends on this thing i might do here and if that happens i can't go and if it doesn't happen then i probably will but i doubt it
yeah injun what do you want?
ok
sure
do you want to pick me up?
sure
can i write down my address and phone number for you?
sure
yeah
i didn't ask anyone for a shrink that was someone else also: this pudding is not mine also: i'm wearing a suit because i had a very important business meeting this morning and i don't have a crying problem
ok
alright?
great chief of st louis send me
hi
hi
it's barry
i thought i should tell you i didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something 
yeah
how long have you known her?
about six months
you like her?
yeah yeah we get along well  you didn't get along with her very well?
did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
the district marshall
no no i did
that's nice it's nice  i've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways cross promotional work by some companies do you remember all that pudding?
yeah
so that pudding was bought i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines it's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products they make frozen meals deli meats pasta sauce breads soups and ice creams this sort of thing
yeah?
i'm sorryi lost my thoughts what i was saying
you were talking about the promotion 
 the promotion says: buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1000 for purchases made with a special coupon so in the supermarket you notice their products first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at $179  that's a pretty good dealbut then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a canand you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label that's those little bar codes you know? the universal product codes?
yeah
that's what's used to redeem the mileage so in noticing the pudding each cup had an individual bar code  in other words: two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles add in the coupon: it's one thousand you see?
hoyah him say tell big lawman in carville that badman jesse james riding toward rising sun above great river near eagle rock
yeah
you see?
yeah no i see 
you see if you spent $3000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles
that's insane that is really really crazy that's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding
yeah
so that was your pudding?
no
i'm sorry i thought you said 
no i didn't say that
east? east above the river heading for the eagle pass?
i thought you said you bought all that pudding 
my friend carlos is doing it who works with me it's his it's his pudding he's doing it it's not mine he's crazy i told him not to do it he's the one who's insane he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though 
your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? is that right? you threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
yes
what happened?
nothing
what did he want?
nothing
ok
did something happen; are you alright?
hoyah
yes i'm fine everything is ok it's fine everything is fine
well it's fine thank you
did you pick it up from the street?
what?
did you take it from the street in front of your work?
yes i did?
are you learning how to play it?
yes? i'm trying
oh that's great
so you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
savagery is what monkeys understand
me get heap firewater 
yes no not really

i thought latisha said you would 
god be with us admiral
mmhmm
 she didn't know what she was talking about 
it'swhateverthat's not cool
david don't just seriously it doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense ok? it's business seriously one hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house i'm serious now ok please now just stop
ok
that's it
can we maybe ask for more money on this?
i'm only paying two of you guys
uch shut up dean
what's the problem?
you don't need to talk all macho "shake him out little bad boy" whatever  you're not an action hero tough guy you're not a gangster 
such as?
hey it's me this guy from la barry egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever 
what did you say?
nothing
put him through
no no this is bad something might have happened we should just 
shut up just put him on the phone it doesn't matter just shut up 
it's fine
are you learning how to play the piano? what is that?
are you sure?
yeah
you could have worn one of those big floppy woman's easter sunday hats
he's being weird i'm sorry i have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit 
it's not bad it's ok
 he's so strange i don't know if you really even would want to go out with him someone like him i said i'd try but it's just 
it's ok it's alright i'll come right back i'll just go pay for my car
sorry
yeah no i have to get something from my car i said
you ready?
are you coming to eat with us?
will you call me later to talk about asking walter for the shrink? and we can talk about  he said you have this crying problem or something?
bye barry
that would have made an impression
ok
ok what should i do about eric?
just tell him to call me
ok
sodid my brother call you?
no
i have no idea what he's doing then i'm sorry that didn't work out
it's fine
you wouldn't want to go out with him anyway honestly he's such a freak sometimes
he did seem a little strange
i figure
wellhe's not that strange don't say that
i'm sorry you're right
i think he's weird but that's me
should i call you later?
i'll just see you when you get back here
ok
i'm pleased to have the new post sir
i'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all france but  on a happier note 
it's remarkable doctor the patients are so subdued; so docile
they've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide
see that's your problem frank by the time you finish figuring out stuff i'm already finished doing it
ever since his unfortunate death there's been a surge of interest in his work i'll use the profits to restore charenton to her former glory
my years tending the lepers at st emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings doctor
we've still a few lone incurables prone to violence to perversion
we oughtn't be reading his nasty stories 
no one's forcing you to listen
once or twice
i hear he's got a whetstone and chisel and he uses them to sharpen his teeth
he's a writer not a madman
then what's he doing here?
i think she's sweet on him that's what i think
no jesse your problem is you're always doing stuff before i'm finished figuring it out
for fuck's sake who else would it be? the witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others yes?
i'm no longer a man i awoke to discover i'd turned into a sparrow
at your service count
now give the signal
"one day fanchon was visited by a surgeon he ran his fingers across her naked skin pulling apart folds of flesh inspecting follicles"
"with that fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue "
"a poker he took a poker from the fire"
we can't all we can do is guard against our own corruption
yes abbe?
the next time you feel the urge to visit the marquis i hope you'll come to confession instead
i reckoned
his stinking breath caused my eyes to run that's all
not now or we're both done for
don't say that; reading's my salvation
but why must you indulge in his pornography?
it's a hard day's wages slaving away for madmen what i've seen in life it takes a lot to hold my interest
but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
i put myself in his stories i play the parts each strumpet each murderess
why not act the role of heroines instead? queen esther from the bible or st joan?
if i wasn't such a bad woman on the page abbe i'll hazard i couldn't be such a good woman in life
he's not the man who's cast a shadow here
hell of a war
i haven't been to see the marquis for ages and i won't  ever again  i swear it i won't speak to him i won't even utter his name 
is that a promise you can truly keep?
i've you to look after me haven't i?
"turn you out?"
by whom? the marquis?
mother's not half so blind as you
why not?
they incite us to act in ways we should not cannot a lesson the marquis would do well to learn
what? what've i done?
don't come back not tonight not again 
i'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
you'll hate me now won't you?
don't come any closer abbe god's watching
you needn't worry valcour it's administrative nothing more
mustn't do that sir
i must grant him his last rites
i don't take my orders from you; not anymore
you'd deny a dying man his salvation?
it's not even noon 
conversation like certain portions of the anatomy always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated
we treat you well enough here don't we marquis? your very own featherbed in lieu of a straw mat your antique writing desk all the way from lacoste enough quills to feather an ostrich 
and what do you think mendez?
all this time in the saddle we get to the farm i'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle
it's true dearheart you've spoiled me pink
in exchange we ask only that you follow the rules now you know as well as i do you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters
i'm entertaining you now aren't i?
i'm not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption
don't be so sure
i'll fill page after page i promise
what did you do? bribe one of the guards?
but you implored me to write for curative purposes to stave off my madness 
but you've no right to publish behind my back without my sanction
have you truly read the book in question? or did you run  straightaway  to the dogeared pages?
we better go to doc's see what's going on here
enough to discern its tenor
and ?
it's not even a proper novel it's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions frankly it even fails as an exercise in craft the characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" 
there i was taxed; it's true
and such puny scope nothing but the very worst in man's nature
i write of the great eternal truths that bind together all mankind the whole world over we eat we shit we fuck we kill and we die
but we also fall in love; we build cities we compose symphonies and we endure why not put that in your books as well?
it's a fiction not a moral treatise
but isn't that the duty of art? to elevate us above the beast?
i thought that was your duty abbe not mine
you're doing just fine
one more trick like this and i'll be forced to revoke all your liberties
it's that doctor fellow isn't it? he's come to usurp your place here hasn't he?
more than your writing's at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure
they can't be serious
our future lies in the stroke of your pen
mightier than the sword indeed
put yourself in my place i've your fellow patients to consider if charenton falls they've no place to go no manner in which to clothe or feed themselves 
fuck 'em they're halfwits and pinheads let 'em die on the streets as nature intended
you among them?
do i have your word?
zee we got to talk to you and your father
honestly you cut me to the core what's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if  when i finally succumb  when at long last i pledge myself to righteous conduct  you regard me with nothing but suspicion? have you no faith in your own medicine?
don't be absurd; it's only a play
how can one man possibly be so selfish?
we held a mirror up to the doctor and  apparently  he didn't like what he saw
if you won't be true to your word then you've left me no choice
you can't  you mustn't  i've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper 
try reading for a change the writer who produces more than he reads? the sure mark of an amateur
that monstrous god of yours? he strung up his very own son like a side of veal; i shudder to think what he'd do to me
you know what sacrilege is don't you? the last refuge of the failed provocateur
whores and pederasts? you're better off without them
saved all our lives doc none of the liberty boys would have come home if not for web mimms doc god's honest truth
you always do
madeleine she's besotted with me; she'd do anything i ask she could pay you a midnight visit 
i don't know who you insult more; her or me
"part the gates of heaven" as it were 
that's enough
you're tense darling you could use a long slow screw
good day marquis
then bugger me
his rug
and my chaise  am i being denied the privilege of sitting  of plopping down my ass 
think about this if we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right
valcour his chair
orvolle his wine  from now on nothing but water at every meal 
 water 
 and your meat shall be deboned
because your writing continues unchecked
its horrors perhaps its darkest nightmares and to what end? nothing but your own morbid gratification 
morbid gratification? no i write what i've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block we're all lined up at the guillotine waiting for the crunch of the blade rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet abbe
a man after my own heart
what in god's name am i to do with you? the more i forbid the more you're provoked
i could be convinced to abandon my writing quite voluntarily
what kind of story are they going to believe?
what on earth would that require?
a night spent with the partner of my choice
you expect me to pimp madeleine?
i wasn't talking about madeleine
coulmier you animal
i do not mean to flirt marquis
oh but you must my pumpkin sex without flirtation is merely rape
now strip
your wig remove your wig
your words drove bouchon to 
maybe maybe
for fuck's sake abbe what am i to do? police my readers as you police me? suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? would you condemn the bible? i think not
an innocent child is dead
so many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work i am blessed am i not?
oh that's rich  coming from her lapdog 
i saw the longing in your eye 
 that was lust 
 the passion in your heart 
i know because i felt it myself 
i wanted to fuck her that's all
and did you?
you can shut up now
it's not your province to ask
you're no stranger to rape marquis; and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged
go to hell
why was it you never took her by force?
who's to say i did not?
was it impotence?
never
then it must've been love 
we inspected the body marquis she died a virgin
tomorrow we'll cut out your tongue
you are a charmer
i'm here
surely you'll grant me a final word
of course
this may feel a tad awkward my friend but it needn't be i've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
of course
it's a formality; truly
you're a man of science; i'm a man of god charenton stands to profit from us both i'm certain
i'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things
if you don't mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs?
it seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy
well i surely know what a quadrant is  but i've never seen it used at night before
i swear i'll shoot you in your sleep
a few indiscretions in his youth
i hope you'll judge him by his progress here and not his past reputation
playing dressup with cretins? that sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure
his wife's influence
his wife's?
better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one
a man of his notoriety? he wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture
what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
he no longer roars or spits he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards 
and his writing?
next time try "fat and haggard"
well?
it's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind
do you favor its publication?
for sale? to the general public? certainly not; it's unprintable
all france is aghast at this book yet you've not heard of it?
i've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them
abbe i admire you; i do you've a conviction an idealism peculiar to the very young and so i'll be candid the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit the most severe instructions
yes?
shut down?
in their eyes the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here
what worries me is that jesus is talking back
but he's one among some two hundred wards 
have you tried bleeding him with leeches? the calming chair? maybe you should flog him at the stake?
why? so he'll learn to fear punishment rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
you're a sentimental man
a practical man sir given the marquis' unusual tastes a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent
you find this amusing do you?
and place my reputation at stake?
charenton is my life's work to have her wrested from beneath me now 
i spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here
and ?
your zee? hmm  "from women's eyes this doctrine i derive: they sparkle still the right promethean fire; they are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world"
he's sworn to obedience
you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here 
i have
 then i've friends of my own to visit
oh indeed?
of course
it was not inspired by circumstance
no it most certainly was not
that's not our intent 
 a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus the theater is henceforth closed as for your avowed friend  playwright emeritus of the madhouse 
heard of him
do more otherwise i'll be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum
what could cause a tincture like this?
it's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children 
this child let loose the beast from its cage 
madeleine's not wicked it's the marquis who's corrupted her that's not her fault; it's mine
you'd suffer in her stead?
he was so impressed with the marquis' tale that he chose to reenact it yes?
i beg you doctor don't make me say it
her name abbe
and my own
damn all that reading paid off
how is the patient faring?
poorly
and you? it must've been an ordeal
i'm not the first man god has asked to shed blood in his name i will not be the last
will you sleep soundly tonight?
no sir plainly put i never expect to sleep again
gibberish my friend he rants and he raves 
monsieur masse says he'd like another manuscript quick as you please he's got himself three presses and he can't print 'em fast enough
i'll pass the word on then
i'll pay you another visit with a share of the profits once its sold
what do you think?
i'll be waiting
maybe someday you'll tell me your name
sweet then? like the pastry?
such gallantry in men is  sadly  a rarity; how lucky i am to receive his charity
i tremble with fear you're bound to pound the quivering lips of my venus mound
and then  to prove your truly mine  i'll plunder you darling from behind
what of my lips will you soil them too? when you've broken every other taboo?
i'll fill every slippery hollow; if you're obliging then you'll swallow
it's not your cup of tea mama
come now darling give it a read
would you get in the carriage? until ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself she's gonna make me miserable
"the vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge still he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman"
yes?
"well worth the dig"
now's not the time to be cheeky maddy
it's because of the marquis isn't it?
don't start 
go ahead; you've a key slip it through my tiny hole
you? frighten me? that's a good one i'm twice as fast as you are who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
it's the only frontier i have left plumcake
i suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours
shut up  uh doc i was wondering if uh this evening i could come by?
i put myself at life and limb surely that's worth a few louis
there's something else i want from you
you've already stolen my heart as well as another more prominent organ south of the equator
your publisher says i'm not to leave without a new manuscript
i've just the story inspired by these very surroundings
is it awfully violent?
most assuredly
is it terribly erotic?
fiendishly so
must i administer them directly or might i blow them?
ma
the price my coquette is every bit as firm as i am
oh you you talk same as you write
the climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap
you demand a lot from your readers you do
what's that then?
tortures so arcane so medieval even i haven't the words to describe them if you've an ounce of pity in your heart you'll throw caution aside and unlock my door
i don't believe it
they decreed me a savage and now they have made me one
it's only been described to me in your books
you're far crueler than i my sweet
come over here
don't care
don't be fooled madeleine he fears for himself he's like a man starving and you  ha  you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream 
he's a man of god; he's true to his vows
first and foremost he's a man you remind him of that fact and he resents you for it
how do you propose i write it? with dust upon the air?
you could whisper it through the walls of your cell
go on child
tomorrow night whisper a new tale to your neighbor cleante he'll whisper it to his neighbor dauphin who'll whisper it to his neighbor franval 
 who'll whisper it to bouchon 
 whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet there armed with a quill of my own i'll commit it to paper
yes you shall of course you shall 
didn't think you would  i'm going to go make the coffin
a tale more horrible than all the rest combined
something to make the angels weep and the saints to gasp for air
"what shall i ready?" asked fanchon "my mouth my ass or my succulent oyster?"
tell him i'm no fool a prison's still a prison even with chinese silk and chandeliers
"by the time you read this we'll be long gone; bound for england or points beyond"
tell him  if he uncovers our whereabouts  you'll slit your wrists with a razor and i'll plunge a hat pin through my heart
you'd do that rather than forsake our love?
no but tell him i would
desperation has driven me past etiquette all the way to frenzy
my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics
make a thousand of 'em still won't be enough by the time i'm through
i pray you: be succinct
you're new to charenton yes? perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband and his unusual case
with all due respect madame all france is familiar with your husband  grant us a moment alone won't you monsieur prouix?
oh you do do you? it is my dearest hope doctor that he remain entombed forever and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms
i pay his stipend every month far more dutifully than i should
that barely covers the cost of his room there's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments opiates to quell his temper restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves
i am not a wealthy woman
but you've a pension haven't you from the sale of his books?
it's tainted money doctor
what a beautiful thought marquise
fine how'd it go out here?
what thought is that?
that illgotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation
oh but i am
 words alone are insufficient
it's beyond perversity that honor should carry a price tag
now is the time to secure your epitaph the benevolent marquise charenton's most revered philanthropist or satan's bride
and i in yours
doctor can i impart to you his cruelest trick?
of course
once long ago in the folly of youth he made me love him
we're gonna have to talk
i'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted and to what end i ask you?
if only you'd remained true to our contract opiates for his nerves restraints the man warrants a bed of nails 
i can say with the utmost sincerity that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use
am i a cursed woman doctor? must i be betrayed by every man i meet 
it's libelous; you wouldn't dare
and why not? my fortune siphoned away my reputation past repair i've nothing left to lose  silence my husband or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own
shame on you truly
forgive me i beg you 
how was i to tell you? by writing a letter? with what my asinine bride?
you've come to lecture me?
and that's why you both lead the gang two of you went into that bank together right?
to flaunt your deviance in public? upon a stage?
they've put you up to this haven't they?
you ought to court the doctor's favor not his contempt
it's the way of all martyrs isn't it?
give me back my anonymity that's all i ask let me be invisible again
he refuses to be seen in my company he blanches at the mention of your name 
it's a convenience isn't it having your husband locked away you no longer have to hold your tongue or hoist your skirts or crack your mouth so i can put it to its one pleasurable use you're not my wife no you're one among my many jailers aren't you?
but it's just begun 
do as i say
very much
and i do so want to shoot some pinkerton detectives
i'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon there we can sit sideby side before the fire
i'd rather read thankyou
you prefer a book to your husband's company?
no when i was but a tender lad
last week would this be?
not you too
it's gonna be fine orson you're gonna do great
i wonder sometimes
you're just scared
am i?
it's the scientific method it's all the rage
oh but haven't you heard? i'm the boy wonder i've been a genius since the moment i was born
we've known each other too long orson sling the bullshit elsewhere
carole you wound me as if i could hope to pacify you with evasions of
don't insult me with your cute press quotes save it for louella
she knew what she was signing on for after all she took the money
houdini mice
you need to get outta here rapunzel
that's why he has the parties he says it's like bringing the world to me
why don't you come down to la? stay with us for a while
with about twenty of his spies on my tail no thanks
bob's upset
mr welles certainly is a caution
yeah orson's a real piece of work but deep down he's a good kid real deep down
and attractive in a hammy sort of way
mm
i can't
sure you can just
he needs me here
and he did
sure
thing that bothers me now though looking back is that i really think i could have been something  special
the posters?
thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts you were a great star and you had a good run that oughta be enough
yeah but all of a sudden it's not
you know this citizen kane picture? about pops and everything?
uhhuh
the character that's supposed to be me susan alexander
marion everyone knows you're not like that
but i am that's the killer honey
my name is orson welles
the actor
and director
you know the deal  i can ' t go if kat doesn't go 
twenty eight
bob here'll kill a man for sneezing and he's the best shot in the gang
i see and you are in california for what reason?
to make pictures
so i've been told
in hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed
i'll remember that
do you?
intimately for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others i have been swimming in blood my entire life but i retain a belief perhaps you will think it old fashioned undoubtedly you will but i believe that private lives should not be public property
elegant words sir when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock i learned at the knee of the master
so where does that leave us mr welles? what kind of sad future are we two making? a future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? a future where no price is too high for fame and power? when we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
randolph
jesse we're outlaws
hope you don't mind my popping in
over at rko?
uhhub
apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself entirely too much like myself do you follow so far?
yeah
you know that can't happen
oh why is that?
why is that louis?
bel air is restricted
yeah
and we're good at it
there's no call for that language
there certainly is i there certainly is aw to hell with you
darling i talked to millicent
she's a catholic she says it would put her soul in peril divorce is a very serious sin apparently
nuts she only cares about the money she thinks i'll make you cut her out of the wwww  will
you oughta lay off him  he is the pppresident after all
he is a bolshevik he will have us at war by the end of the year i think i'm going to run that wheelchair picture
don't
nothing for you to worry about darling
pops
it got to you didn't it all the killing in the war you need it now
how much?
it's not really
how much?
yes
one    buys things
nailed us hub? the crazy old man and his whore
marion
bought and pppaid for just like one of his goddamn statues well at least in the movie he married her
this picture
i am not that woman
you've killed your fair share of men
there's nothing to explain
a million dollars a year on art and stststatues and there's nothing to explain?
i will not defend my life to you
i'm not asking you to defend anything but we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it
we are in no "pickle"  as you would euphemistically have it
you gotta wake up now pops
there is nothing to discuss
you don't have any money left okay? that's the truth i don't wanna say it nobody else will say it but it's the truth you spent it all you can't buy the tribune in chicago  you can't buy ^ gg goddamn thing now you better face up to it
you are being typically theatrical marion i need the tribune to
you don't need it that's the problem you always think you need everything
if i could go back to farming 
it's 12th century from deauville  in france
i know where deauville is for ccchrist's sake
you needn't use that language with me
did you need it? did you need any of it?
i wanted it
there's a different between want and
not for me
but why? just so you can show it all off  just so everyone can see what a bbbig man you are?
you will not walk out on me
you are repellant when you drink
that's a lie you could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen
tough shit we need to tttalk about this
you are slovenly and unattractive and i won't  ttttolerate it
i will not have this in my home
i just want to understand
no you don't you want to condemn me like everyone else you want to point to the pathetic old man grown lunatic with his spending  trapped in his ridiculous
castle  still fighting old battles he will never win with pulitzer and roosevelt and hollywood
i don't want you to
there is nothing to understand but this:   i am a man who could have been great but was not
how so?
the jigsaw puzzles and the urn career  the man spending a fortune to make her a star  only it's opera and not movies and
i can't quit and leave you alone i can't quit until you quit ma would've wanted it that way
yes?
the drinking
thank you sir she begins to leave
sir? 
why did we not know about this sooner?
sir?
i pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in hollywood do i not? if you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me
sir i
please be quiet
he looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you
we're doing this for ma
and how do you feel when you are lied to?
good retain that feeling let it nourish you from this day forth it shall nourish us both
"you talk about the people as if you owned them as though they belonged to you as long as i can remember you've talked about"  orson i am so goddamn tired
i can't remember the lines
then make them up you're drunk and you're angry
we're not all hopped up on benzedrine orson i some of us humans need sleep
"you don't care about anything except you you just want to persuade people that you
love them so much that they ought to love you back only you want love on your own terms "
"a toast then jedediah to love on my own terms those are the only terms anybody ever knows his own"
huh?
maybe it started out that way but now
what we are going to do is shoot life  in all it's joyous complexity
we're using
you're not doin' hearst are you?
good god no the character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons
a delicious amalgamation is it?
orson hold on look into my eyes tell me you are not doing hearst
i am not doing hearst
louella hello i was just fixing a drink would you like?
you drink at 10 am do you?
no  no  i mean
he's drawing an isthmus he's saying we're on an isthmus
what do you want me to say frank? i was killing men when i was fifteen i like getting shot at i like riding out of town with a posse at my back this is a helluva better life than farming
i wanna see the picture today
that might be a tad difficult because orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music
cut the malarkey buddy the boss himself wants me to see the picture today
he personally asked you to?
that's right
uhhuh
louella please be reasonable i understand you have problems with orson's picture but maybe we can work something out
nix sweetie you shelve it
oh for god's sake louella
and mr hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture he'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to new york and do shakespeare with the boy wonder
a better life than the one you could have had with zee?
can i talk to hearst?
you are talking to him
all right enough i've heard this from schaefer and rko i've heard it from everyone
but you keep coming up with the same elitist crap   heart of darkness with a million dollar budget?   no one wants to see that
nonsense
forget it
what are movies about?
telling stories
nope
showing life
oh yeah
who the hell wants to see life? people are sick to death of life they want makebelieve pal fantasy they want tarzan and jane not tristan and isolde
butts on seats that's what movies are about you got one job in hollywood  everyone has the same job in fact  putting the butts on the seats you gotta sell 'em popcorn and pepsi cola it's all about popcorn and pepsicola
not for me
then you better get ready to be the youngest never was in hollywood history
that's better than being the oldest hasbeen in hollywood history
you're a laughriot kid
right
we find the man and then we dissect him
like a bug
but with compassion and insight
just do me a favor think about what this is costing everybody not just the railroad
christ we gotta go the old man doesn't cotton to lateness
i'm not fucking with hughes that shitkicker would kill us dead baby just like jean harlow
howard hughes killed jean harlow?
sure dropped her out of his lockheed over utah
kid you just got your ass kicked on joseph conrad and now you're gonna go to schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? stop being so goddamn smart
who the hell's manolete?
the great spanish bullfighter
i don't wanna write about no spic
no it's perfect when in doubt put on a cape false noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the lifeblood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and booth  imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky andalusian plains
the old man has his own way of doing things
no i 
he's nothing but a hypocrite he preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress
no baby those are the hands of a killer
the whole joint is half the size of rhode island
jesus
yeah it's the place god would have built if he'd had the money
orson please  it's too bright
okay boy wonder what?
listen  i've got it it came to me like a thief in the night pure inspiration total magnificence
i know who we're going to get i the great american biography a journey into the soul of the beast
this better be good
got any ideas little brother?
image a man that has shaped his time a titanic figure of limitless influence think about empire a man with an empire at his feet a man like a baron living in a palace a glorious palace on a hill and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him feudal
oh christ
image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his
oh christ
please don't say this
mank
don't whisper it don't even think it
how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses  every single day in the newspapers and on the radio  waiting for us in that ridiculous castle waiting for
orson stop just stop
listen to you you child men like him don't bother with things like legality they don't have to you know why boyo?   power   power like you couldn't even begin to imagine
jim was old enough
howard hughes he would just kill us hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved
we're doing hearst
so speaks the court jester
fuck you
i expected more from you
sorry to disappoint
how does it feel mank? going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? how does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves?
don't do this
where did he go? he hasn't had a screen credit in four years
don't do this
he was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the west how was he supposed to say no to that?
because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself amusing his keepers because he is a sycophant because he has been thrown out of every studio in hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk 
listen to me
fuck you
i am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again
i don't have it anymore?
when i was a kid i wanted to scorch the world too   i had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories but all that's finished for me
it doesn't have to be
and yeah sure hearst's a great subject been keeping notes on him for years for my   great american novel but i can't do it anymore no studio's gonna hire me and i  
i'll hire you   right now
i can't do it okay? i drink too much  i drink all the fucking time and i don't have it anymore all that is over for me
railroad burned him out too you couldn't have stopped him
not unless i tell you it is
then let him what have we got to lose you and i?
everyone sees someone different that's what we show
how?
like a jewel turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated
this girl on a dock white dress never said a word to her
why her?
she was    innocent
they don't have to
he loves in his own way on his conditions because those are the only conditions he has ever known
you're a pisspoor liar for the smartest man i know
and what does he see?
the people when they pay him homage he adores them but when they have the  audacity to question him to doubt him to embarrass him then he despises them
and when he looks up? what does he dream about?
yeah but the margins are real wide
it is 350 pages of  absolute inspiration
good? good? words fail you at last it's terrific now i'll have to do some shaping of course and some of the scenes aren't exactly    exactly   
what?
short enough but this is a grand start and i think we need to change the name
the title?
no american is a blessed title directly sent from god's soul to your mind we shall never change that i mean the name of the publisher charles foster craig doesn't have the knivesout poetry i need i was thinking about "kane"  you like that?
we can't be
yeah
cain  like the bible guy?
kane one strong syllable kane i
craig is one syllable
but it's not a great syllable
to my invaluable comrade drink up
you can't do this tome  this was our story remember?  you and me and goddamn everyone else   remember that?
uh huh
i just can't   see it anymore
fuck you  you wanted me out i'm out
i'm sorry
a war against the railroad what the hell were we thinking?
i don't care
i don't give a shit about
he was a drunk and he was my father and i was ashamed of him
mank sit down you missed the opening of the new picture but i'll go back
no you gotta hear this
"and how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real americans? doesn't hollywood know there's a depression on? don't real americans deserve work?"
well at least she's off kane today
no she's not don't you get it ya lunk? she's using code language to the studio bosses "bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees"  who the hell do you think she's talking about?
hedy lamarr?
jews she's talking about jews
i'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time
so they're jews  
this is just the first shot maestro sooner or later she's gonna use the word and all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the jews
christ
me i'm proud to be a jew i got no problem you don't like it fuck you but with these guys it's like a dirty word all they wanna be is good red whiteandblue americans and the way they see it you can't be a good american and a jew so sam goldfish becomes sam goldwyn and david selznick becomes david 0 selznick  like anyone's gonna think he's irish for fuck's sake
what does this have to do with?
believe you me they're gonna do anything  and i mean absolutely anything  to stop that word from gettin' out
what? are they going to kill me? is that what they're going to do?
it's too late the movie's made
they won't let it out not hearst not the other studio heads
you wrote the damn thing mank aren't you going to fight for it?
see you soon oh and i appreciate the distraction back there
i told you this was going to happen i told you he was going to come after us so we took the chance anyway and we lost that's how it goes okay? i got my check kid and so did you  and that's what it's all about  so fuck it and move on
kinda
this ain't george's doing
hell i know how it ends  hey rosebud's the sled
mank
face it orson they're gonna hate it i told you not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of new york actors
george
aw cheer up george'll probably be running fox by the morning let's get a drink
yeah you're probably right
yeah ain't it swell?
hell they hardly even noticed us
and they went to the stockholders in new york
oh god
i been talking to swanbeck in new york and orson i think they're gonna take it a long pause as welles looks at schaefer
herman
so ain't this just the bee's knees? the high muckeymucks dolled up all azteclike for the human sacrifice
i um need an estimate on some jewelry i might wish to sell but dddiscretion is very important to me bbbecause i don't want anyone ttto um know that
excuse me i hope this isn't rude but aren't you marion davies?
yes
well this is a great pleasure miss davies i just saw that enchantment is playing at a the tivoli the revival house in santa monica that was a fine picture
thank you
yeah jimmy?

of course of course how can we be of service?
as i said i have some jjjj  that i might wish ttto sell and i wanted an estimate
surely my pleasure miss davies
800000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more hell george you even make a profit on the deal
very generous
and we gotta be clear here i need the negative and every existing print
to do what?
that's for me to decide
every time you tell that story you stop there that's not how it ended i was five when my dad got shot
you're going to destroy it
no maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it
you're lying to me
we already made the same offer to the stockholders
yes
you talked to mr swanbeck?
get out
you're bettin' on an inside straight this time you'll never pull it off
get out
again
i know but that's how it should have ended your dad and mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy
again
again
again
again
citizen kane
pardon?
citizen kane there's your title
now look orson let's not get ahead of ourselves the budget projections on this
i know i know but what more can you expect of me? i have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to
listen get off your horse with me you know i've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like while the stockholders in new york were ready to cut and run and everyone else in hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room but your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand this one's gonna come in at 750 thousand what do we do about that?
sounds like he was a hell of a man
jesus
do war of the worlds as a feature and everyone's happy you make some money and new york's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to kane
please don't ask me to do this
it's the safe bet orson there's nothing wrong with that
ah it's a grand title
they've all seen a rough cut
the magazines are one thing  but hedda why did we have to let her come?
when hedda says "i'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray
the ad
then find another theater
that he was
you don't think i've tried? no one is willing to open the picture
then we'll open it in detroit or dallas or kalamazoo for god's sake we'll show it in goddamn circus tents and
"do what you can"? that's not good enough i
well it' s all you've got 
you're with them aren't you? you're going to bury my movie they bought you
for christ's sake shut up
why don't you just have the guts to admit it
how dare you talk to me like that do you think i'm like all the rest of those pirates? like mayer and warner? is that what you think?
it's just that my movie is so
"your movie"  i am so sick of that it's your movie  but it's his life did you ever think about that? did you ever think about that old man and marion having to watch as you tore them apart?
immediately
they're making him a hero now
that soulless monster gets no tears from me
who the fuck are you trying to kid? you are that soulless monster
i really think you're

i think he was just a real interestin' fella to have around
he's an embarrassment because frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it and i'm lookin' very bad i can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood why's he make it so hard on himself? he comes to me i can make it easier for him
tommy jake respects you he won't even say hello to anybody else  you know that but you know when jake gets set on somethin' jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it i'm his kid brother i got no say with jake on this he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen joey you understand you tell him i don't care how great he is or how colorful he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head
i'd like to talk to jake a minute
you were a big favorite in this fight then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 125 underdog

joey relax you're taking this the wrong way why don't you sit down and have a drink?
arr hand over your jewels missy
excuse me i'm talking to my sister inlaw
excuse me for living

hey joey i'm here with patsy and vera and sandy and vickie just happened to come along we're just trying to have a good time what do you want from me? so why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand
i'll suck your eyes out i'll fuckin' take the two of you
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training i can't go out? what am i a goddamn prisoner?
no you're his wife
i'm not doing anything wrong i'm just trying to have a good time do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
it don't look right
well go ahead tell jake he's gonna kill me anyway it's a matter of time
thank god you grew out of that  you did grow out of that didn't you?
i'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out he will kill you what's the matter with you? aren't you happy? you got everything you want
you don't sleep with him i do i don't get to breathe without tellin' him he keeps me in a cage if he thinks i'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way i get used as a punching bag he don't trust nobody if he saw the two of us talking together right now you'd be in trouble too  believe me look at me joey i'm 19 years old i wanna enjoy my life i love jake but you don't know he gets crazy sometimes i'm scared
try to understand vickie jake's got a lotta aggravation he's been a top contender too long
that's right take his part you're his brother he's never gonna be champ too many people are against him
and you're drinking with them right now
and i'm gonna finish my drink and i'm gonna have a good time because i ain't doing nothing wrong
this is l b jefferies a friend of tom's who am i talking with?
oh when are they expected home?
i'm hired 'til one they went to dinner and maybe nightclubbing
well if he calls in tell him to get in touch with l b jefferies right away i might have quite a surprise for him
mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor
does he have your number mr jefferies?
he has it thank you
goodnight
from the looks of davidson's cable it might even go higher than that and we haven't even got a camera over there
this could go off in a month  or an hour
i'll pull somebody out of japan
bryce the only man for this job is sitting right here in town  get me l b jefferies
jefferies?
name me a better photographer
but his leg
we're on the verge of a mutiny colon
you planning on being a bachelor your whole life jesse james?
don't worry  it comes off today
namely?
get that idea out of your mind it will only lead you in the wrong direction
when the lock is broken  yes
didn't you take it to the crime lab?
that's what they call a family problem
because everything that man's done has been suspicious trips at night in the rain saws knives trunks with rope and a wife that isn't there any more
i'll admit it all has a mysterious sound  but is could mean a number of different things murder is the least likely
go ahead doyle  tell me he's an unemployed magician  amusing the neighborhood with sleightofhand
well officer  do your duty
not if i find the right girl
you've got a lot to lean about homicide jeff morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them that salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner toss her in a trunk and put her in storage
i'll bet it's been done
almost everything's been done  under panic but this is a thousand to one shot that man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked
you think i made all this up?
i think you saw something  that probably has a very simple explanation
for instance?
his wife took a trip
she  was  an  invalid
you told me  i've got to run jeff
all right  you don't believe me
and what's this right girl like?
thanks
we know the wife is gone i'll see if i can find out where
do that
i was jaywalking
i think they missed their chance with her
she never left the apartment 
then where is she  in the ice box?
 until yesterday morning
what time?
six ayem
smart funny bossy always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth
too bad the thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time
not yet
who left  where?
the thorwalds  at six in the morning?
now how could anybody guess that? they had perhaps signs on their luggage "grand central or bust"?
the superintendent met thorwald coming back he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country
a very convenient guy  this superintendent have you checked his bank deposits lately?
jeff  huh?
well  what good is his information? it's a secondhand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself  thorwald anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
i hate to remind you  but this all started because you said she was murdered now did anyone including you actually see her murdered?
where will you find such a girl?
doyle  are you interested in solving a case or making me look foolish?
if possible  both
well then do a good job of it get over there and search thorwald's apartment it must be kneedeep in evidence
i can't do that
i mean when he goes out for a paper or a drink or something what he doesn't know won't hurt him
i can't do it even if he's gone
what's the matter? does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
now don't get me mad even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it if i were ever caught in there i'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes
just make sure you're not caught if you find something you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules if you find nothing  he's clear
at the risk of sounding stuffy jeff  i'll remind you of the constitution and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim he must ask for evidence
honestly you'd do if only you had the buck teeth
give him evidence
i can hear myself starting out "your honor  i have a friend who's an amateur sleuth an one night after a heavy supper "  he'd throw the new york state penal code right in my face  and it's six volumes
by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment
a detective's nightmare
what do you need before you can search  bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
one thing i don't need is heckling you called and asked me for help  and now you're acting like a taxpayer
how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
you know every day for three years i asked myself that same question?
ever get an answer?
yeah  frequently  it ran something like this: "your request for transfer turned down "
sparkling rocks?
oh  i almost forgot
mrs thorwald
you think he's getting out of here?
everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom ready for packing
he has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there
you sure it belongs to his wife?
you figured that out huh?
well in the garage back home we 
and how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
your logic is backward
little ones
all the things i hate
that depends on who "they" were
the police department at merritsville they called to report the trunk was just picked up  by mrs anna thorwald
this is doyle jeff
tom i've got something real big for you
look jeff don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be 
listen to me lisa's been arrested
your lisa?
my lisa she went into thorwald's apartment and he came back the only way i could get her out was to call the police
i told you that 
is this one of frank's shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
i know what you told me she went in to get evidence and she came out with it
like what?
like mrs thorwald's wedding ring if that woman were still alive she'd be wearing it
a possibility
a fact last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden why? because he had something buried in there something a dog could scent
like an old hambone?
i don't know what pet name thorwald had for his wife and that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase he wasn't taking his possessions because they're up in his apartment now
you think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
in sections and one other thing doubting tom  it just occurred to me that all the calls thorwald made were long distance if he called his wife the day she left  after she arrived in merritsville  why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
where'd they take lisa?
yep
precinct six i sent a friend over with bail money
maybe you won't need it i'll run it down jeff
if that ring checks out we'll give him an escort so long
congratulations jeff
for what?
for getting rid of that cast
who said i was getting rid of it?
gunnison  how did you get to be such a big editor  with such a small memory?
wrong day?
wrong week next wednesday i emerge from this plaster cocoon
you think i don't know that?
were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
that's too bad jeff well i guess i can't be lucky every day forget i called
yeah i sure feel sorry for you gunnison must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week
indochina got a code tip from the bureau chief this morning the place is about to go up in smoke
didn't i tell you didn't i tell you it was the next place to watch?
you did
okay when do i leave? halfhour? an hour?
with that cast on  you don't
stop sounding stuffy i'll take pictures from a jeep from a water buffalo if necessary
you're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with i'll send morgan or lambert
swell i get myself halfkilled for you  and you reward me by stealing my assignments
i've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time
i didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track
you asked for something dramatically different you got it
so did you goodbye jeff
you've got to get me out of here six weeks  sitting in a tworoom apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors
i've been taking pictures so long i don't know how to read anymore
i'll send you some comic books
listen  if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom  i'll do something drastic
like what?
i'll  i'll get married then i'll never be able to go anywhere
it's about time you got married  before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man
frank and me have to go away for a while
can you see me  rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry the electric dishwasher the garbage disposal and a nagging wife
jeff  wives don't nag anymore  they discuss
well  you know best call you later jeff
next time have some good news
gunnison?
yeah is that you jeff?
it's me
something wrong?
the word is "everything" now what time does my plane leave tuesday?
jeff 
me neither
i don't care where it goes  just as long as i'm on it
okay indochina tuesday we'll pick you up
that's more like it goodnight old buddy
yeah
did you get my note?
who are you?
i'll give you a chance to find out meet me in the bar at the brevoort  and do it right away
why should i?
for a little business meeting  to settle the estate of your late wife
i don't know what you mean
let the law 
now stop wasting time thorwald or i'll hang up and call the police
i only have a hundred dollars or so
that's a start i'm at the brevoort now i'll be looking for you
no
tell her to bring it back
then if the police get me  you won't be around to laugh
well i only quote from the best
how?
it crashed didn't it?
you've got a hormone deficiency
laws don't touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does
how can you tell that from a thermometer
those sultry sunworshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks
don't you ever heat that stuff up
gives your circulation something to fight  what kind of trouble?
lisa fremont
you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood
she expects me to marry her
that's normal
i don't want to
that's abnormal
whose justice? yours or god's?  when will you stop?
i'm not ready for marriage
nonsense a man is always ready for marriage  with the right girl and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open
she's all right
no
her father loading up the shotgun?
stella
it's happened before you know some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say
she's just not the girl for me
she's only perfect
too perfect too beautiful too talented too sophisticated too everything  but what i want
when my name makes them cry in their sleep when i've brought them to ashes
is what you want something you can discuss?
people with sense can belong wherever they're put
can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank?  if only she was ordinary
probably but when i do it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress a lobster dinner and the latest scandal i need a woman who'll go anywhere do anything and love it
i can just hear you now "get out of here you perfect wonderful woman you're too good for me"
that's the hard part
there's an intelligent way to approach marriage
intelligence nothing has caused the human race more trouble modern marriage
baloney once it was see somebody get excited get married  now it's read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
people have different emotional levels that 
jesse what are you thinking? there are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county
ask for trouble and you get it why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years then he refused to marry her why?  because she only scored sixtyone on a look magazine marriage quiz
that's fine stella now would you make me a sandwich?
she pay you much?
how did you know
eyes bloodshot must have been staring out the window for hours
i was
what'll you do if one of them catches you?
depends one which one
she's real eat drink and be merry girl
and she'll end up fat alcoholic and miserable
i had to see you i'm getting married
speaking of misery miss lonely hearts drank herself to sleep again alone
poor girl someday she'll find her happiness
and some man will lose his
isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
well the salesman could be available soon
he and his wife splitting up?
it's hard to figure he went out several time last night in the rain carrying his sample case
isn't he a salesman?
now what could he sell at three in the morning?
flashlights luminous dials for watches house numbers that light up
we're lost
she's the most wonderful woman in the world can't get her out of my mind
he was taking something out of the apartment i'm certain
sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run
but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it
no the shades are still drawn in their apartment
in this heat?  they're up now
get back there he'll see you
it's not an ordinary look it's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him
uhhuh
police?
huh?
that's wonderful it's just i thought
you called the police?
oh well yes and no it wasn't an official call he's just a friend  an old ornery friend
i'll watch the alleyway  in case it goes that way
uhuh the dog i think i know now why thorwald killed it
and digging in  look at that flower bed
there's something buried there
look
i have a feeling we've just begun
what?
miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules
she's beautiful smart and has the biggest buck teeth in all of missouri
you can tell that from here?
i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter
would four of them  ?
no  but it makes the rest easy to take and she's reading the bible
then i wouldn't worry too much but let's keep an eye on her
you don't say i might just take that compliment as an insult
got a shovel?
no
there's probably one in the basement
now wait a minute 
that's why i picked it we can start a whole new life down here
there's no point in taking unnecessary chances  give me the phone book lisa
smart girl
smart? she'll be arrested
that'll get her out of there won't it?
stella  how long do you think he'll stay there?
unless he's dumber than i think he won't wait 'til his lease is up
to bail lisa out of jail
how much do you think you'll need?
first offense burglary    probably twofifty  the piggy bank
thirtythree here totals oneninety not enough
are you going to be happy here mr james? without all that excitement?
i got twenty or so in my purse give me what you've got
when those cops get a look at miss fremont  they'll even contribute
mrs doyle?
yes
jeff again  has tom come in yet?
not yet jeff
you haven't even heard from him?
not a word
i'm afraid it is tess
i'll have him call the moment i hear from him
i've got you you keep me busy i figure we'll get over to the hotel get checked in cleaned up then i'd like to do something i've been thinking about for a long time
tell him not to waste time calling to get over here soon as he can i think thorwald's pulling out tonight
who's thorwald?
he knows  don't worry tess it's a man
goodnight you idiot
goodnight mrs doyle
mmmm  hurts a little
and your stomach?
empty as a football
and you love life?
not too active
now wait a minute there are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding
anything else bothering you?
uhhuh
only because it's expected of her
 a steal at eleven hundred dollars
that dress should be listed on the stock exchange
we sell a dozen a day in this price range
who buys them? tax collectors?
going on right here it's a big night
it's just a runofthemill monday the calendar's loaded with them
hasn't been any big demand for tickets
"hmm" what?
it's cracked  and you never use it and it's too ornate i'm sending up a plain flat silver one  with just your initials engraved
now that's no way to spend your hard earned money
i wanted to jeff  oh
you have perhaps an ambulance outside?
fine corkscrew's on the right
yeah  i want to get this thing off and get moving
well i'm going to make this a week you'll never forget
tired?
not a bit i was all morning in a sales meeting then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne  just over from paris with some spy reports back to the "21" for lunch with the harper's bazaar people  that's when i ordered dinner then two fall showings  twenty blocks apart then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward  we're trying to get his next show  then i had to dash back and change
tell me  what was slim hayward wearing?
"but the life of the james gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing for these young missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies especially the handsome and charismatic jesse james"
she looked very cool she had on a mint green 
that's good news
someday you might want to open up your own studio here
how could i run it from say  pakistan?
i wish there was one i wanted
make the one you want
you mean leave the magazine?
yes
for what?
for yourself  and me  i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow fashion portraits 
"blazing guns of the west true stories of jesse james" only a dime in the hotel lobby
that's what i'm afraid of  could you see me  driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep  wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit
let's not talk any more nonsense huh?
miss lonely hearts at least that's something you'll never have to worry about
oh? you can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
not exactly  but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours  you of course remember miss torso
she's not in love with him  or any of them
how can you tell that  from here?
you said it resembled my apartment didn't you?
i think it's enchanting
nowhere hi daddy
the land is there  i know it
let me see that
no wonder he's having so much trouble with it
there's nothing i'm hiding it's just that 
it doesn't make sense to me what's so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
some people can now if you'll let me explain 
what is it but traveling from one place to another taking pictures? it's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation
all right that's your opinion you're entitled to it but 
it's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special private little group of anointed people
you can't fit in here  i can't fit in there according to you people should be born live an die on the same 
lisa shut up
of course not
oh i'm not finished  "when he sauntered into a saloon his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple"  as i said hmm
you might have to if you went with me ever try to keep warm in a c54 at fifteen thousand feet at twenty below zero?
ever get shot at run over sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
three
well they'd be very stylish in finland  just before you froze to death begin to get the idea?
jeff you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me i'm wrong
if anything i'm making it sound good  let's face it lisa you aren't made for that kind of a life few people are
right now it doesn't seem so
there's nothing wrong with you lisa you have the town in the palm of your hand
not quite  it seems  goodbye jeff
you mean "goodnight"
now sweetie y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels would you?
i mean what i said
without any future?
your mind is and when i want a man i want all of him
i have one now
so do i
tell me about it
why would a man leave his apartment three times on a rainy night with a suitcase? and come back three times?
he likes the way his wife welcomes him home
not that salesman's wife and why didn't he go to work today?
homework it's more interesting
jesse have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy?
what's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
nothing thank heaven
why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
i wouldn't dare answer that
lisa  there's something terribly wrong
something too frightful to utter
now lisa 
sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing  but doing it the way you are    with with binoculars and with wild opinions about every little movement you see  is is diseased
do you think i consider this recreation?
i don't know what you consider it  but if you don't stop it i'm getting out of here
aw shucks ma'am
you'd better before you catch the disease
what is it you're looking for?
i want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife does that make me sound like a madman?
what makes you think something's wrong with her?
a lot of things she's an invalid who needs constant care  and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day
maybe she died
where's the doctor  the undertakers?
she could be under sedatives sleeping  he's in the room now
there's nothing to see
there is  i've seen things through that window bickering family fights mysterious trips at night knives saws rope  and since last evening not a sight or sound of his wife now you tell me where she is and what she's doing
stop it this is just sad
maybe he's leaving his wife i don't know and i don't care lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses lots of men don't speak to their wives all day lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts  but very very very few of them end up in murder  if that's what you're thinking
it's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
you could see all the things he did couldn't you?
what are you getting at?
you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard?
yeah
jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that? that he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
that's where he's being clever acting nonchalant
and that's where you're not being clever he wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades
don't you see how silly you're being?
swimming swimming is good
okay lisa  probably you're right he's probably in the bedroom now entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick i'll admit to criminal insanity now when do i start the cure?
what's the apartment house number?
125 west ninth street
to get on home
all right  but what's he doing now?
he was just laying all his things out on one of the beds coats suits shirts sox even his wife's 
what about it?
he had it hidden in the dresser well at least it was in there he took it out went to the phone and called somebody long distance  his wife's jewelry was in the handbag and something about it worried him he was asking somebody advice over the phone
someone not his wife?
i never saw him ask her for advise before  but she volunteered plenty
what?
i don't know
suppose he doesn't come back again?
he will all his things are still piled on the bed
not yet
thinking about thorwald?
and you and you friend doyle   did you hear from him again  since he left?
not a word he was going to check on the railroad station and the trunk he must be still on it
it doesn't make sense to me
what doesn't?
women aren't that unpredictable
if you don't see it it's not real
lisa  i can't guess what you're thinking
because she didn't know she was going on a trip  and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag
do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
they do not and they don't leave it behind them a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry
inside stuff?
basic equipment you don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag
i'm with you sweetie but detective thomas j doyle has a pat answer for that
that mrs thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
that's what the witnesses told him
well i have a pat rebuttal for mr doyle  that couldn't be mrs thorwald  or i don't know women
yes ma'am
still  those witnesses
we'll agree they saw a woman  but she wasn't mrs thorwald  that is yet
don't be too hard on him he's a steady worker i wish he'd get there though
don't rush me we have all night
night i'm going to stay with you
you'll have to clear that through my landlord 
well that's fine but i only have one bed and 
lisa i won't be able to give you any 
that's a suitcase?
a mark cross overnight case anyway compact but ample enough
you don't know anything  listen colon these are my ships right? so i'm telling you we're turning back
i can't believe i had to blow up a train for you
i'd be no better than thorwald to refuse
it's utterly beautiful  i wish i could be creative
you are you have a talent for creating difficult situations
i do?
staying the night here uninvited
the same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls and overpassionate daughters of the rich
the same
but he never ends up marrying her strange
weird  why don't i slip into something comfortable?
you mean  like the kitchen? and make us some coffee?
you are a hell of a woman
exactly what i had in mind  along with some brandy
who was the trunk addressed to?
i'm not much on rear window ethics
of course they have the same chance they can look at me like a bug under glass if they want to
jeff  if anybody walked in here i don't think they'd believe what they see
huh?
you and me with long faces  plunged into despair  because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife we're two of the most frightening ghouls i've ever known
i think i'll start reviving it tomorrow with say  miss torso for a start?
no lisa  i don't think he did
thank you
don't swear
well  if there was one less thread this way    and two less that way    i might give up bachelorhood
but you're not?
in the whole courtyard only one person didn't come to the window 
is he cleaning house?
he's washing down the bathroom walls
it's just a picture of the backyard that's all
i know but there's one important change the flowers in thorwald's pet flower bed
it could be  the knife and the saw
too close
and the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring  do you ever leave yours at home?
yes ma'am
now hold on i'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers  but i don't care to watch two women end up like that dog 
maybe i can get thorwald out of the apartment
how?
chelsea 27099  we scared him once maybe we can scare him again  i'm using that word "we" a little too freely i guess i don't take any of the chances
shall we vote him in stella?
lisa  i  i  can't tell you how scared i was that you  you might 
shut up i'm all right
think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
your name?
l b jefferies
i'll explain on the way
phone number?
chelsea 25598
two minutes
wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
a new disease
friend of yours?

what would you do dad?
i wouldn't do anything hasty let's get a little light on the subject
how'd that happen  what kind of trouble you in?
the kind we've been talking about can you answer me now?
listennobody should make a snap decisionthis isn't something you justwe ought to consider all the pros and cons
we don't have time

well now

i'm in terrible troubleyou know that big high bluff near miller town junction?

yes
now i'm not gonna bullshit you i don't really care about what you know or don't know i'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless not to get information but because torturing a cop amuses me there's nothing you can say i've heard it all before there's nothing you can do except pray for a quick death which you ain't gonna get

there is no fuckin' set up  look this is the news blondie you stay here and take care of them two white and pink come with me 'cuz if joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you
i gotta go along with mr pink on this i've seen it happen
it's not the black beverly hills it's the black palos verdes anyway this chick elois was a maneater upper i bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once you know who she looked like? christie love 'member that tv show "get christie love"? she was a black female cop she always used to say "you're under arrest sugar"
i was in the sixth grade when that show was on i totally dug it what the fuck was the name of the chick who played christie love?
pam grier
no it wasn't pam grier pam grier was the other one pam grier made the movies christie love was like a pam grier tv show without pam grier
i look forward to seeing it
what the fuck was that chick's name? oh this is just great i'm totally fuckin' tortured now
well whoever she was elois looked like her so one night i walk into the club and no elois now the bartender was a wetback he was a friend of mine his name was carlos so i asked him "hey carlos where's lady e tonight?" well apparently lady e was married to this real piece of dog shit i mean a real animal and apparently he would so things to her
let me say this out loud just to get it straight in my mind according to you mr blonde was gonna kill you then when we came back kill us grab the diamonds and scram that's your story? i'm correct about that right?
this better not be some freddy joke
what bar?
the boots and socks in gardena when we got there i met joe and a guy named mr white it's a phony name my name's mr orange
you ever seen this motherfucker before?
who mr white?
yeah
no he ain't familiar he ain't one of cabot's soldiers either he's gotta be from outta town but joe knows him real well
yes  it would be a pity wouldn't it?  call him back
sir?
how can you tell?
the way they talk to each other you can tell they're buddies
did the two of you talk?
me and mr white?
yeah
a little
what about?
the brewers
the milwaukee brewers?
yeah they had just won the night before and he made a killing off 'em
what is that?
well if this crook's a brewers fan his ass has gotta be from wisconsin and i'll bet you everything from a diddleeyed joe to a damnedifi know that in milwaukee they got a sheet on this mr white motherfucker's ass i want you to go through the mugs of guys from old milwaukee with a history of armed robbery and put a name to that face
where i was from who i knew how i knew nice guy had i done time shit like that
fuckin' a i tell it real good too
it's a scene memorize it
what?
a undercover cop has got to be marlon brando to do this job you got to be a great actor you got to be naturalistic you got to be naturalistic as hell if you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor and bad acting is bullshit in this job
but what is this?
it's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal
what?
something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job
what sir?
i gotta memorize all this shit?
it's like a joke you remember what's important and the rest you make your own the only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it
i can do that
the things you gotta remember are the details it's the details that sell your story now this story takes place in this men's room so you gotta know the details about this men's room you gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands you gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors you gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap whether they got hot water or not 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story everybody should believe it and if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room and you get one detail they remember right they'll swear by you
he's a cool guy a real nice real funny real cool guy
what for?
traffic tickets gone to warrant they stopped him for something found the warrants on 'im took 'im to jail she doesn't want to walk around alone with all that weed well i don't wanna do this i have a bad feeling about it but she keeps askin' me keeps askin' me finally i said okay 'cause i'm sick of listening to it well we're picking this guy up at the train station
you can do some crazy things with it
i stand outside and guard the door i don't let anybody come in or go out
mr brown?
oh that i'll let jenkins explain
mr brown stays in the car he's parked across the street till i give him the signal then he pulls up in front of the store
mr blonde and mr blue?
crowd control they handle customers and employees in the display area
you two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds we're there for those stones period since no display cases are being fucked with no alarms should go off we're out of there in two minutes not one second longer what if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
when you're dealing with a store like this they're insured up the ass they're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever if you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's charles bronson take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in drops 'em right to the floor everyone jumps he falls down screaming blood squirts out his nose freaks everybody out nobody says fuckin' shit after that you might get some bitch talk shit to ya but give her a look like you're gonna smash her in the face next watch her shut the fuck up now if it's a manager that's a different story the managers know better than to fuck around so if one's givin' you static he probably thinks he's a real cowboy so what you gotta do is break that sonofabitch in two if you wanna know something and he won't tell you cut off one of his fingers the little one then you tell 'im his thumb's next after that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear i'm hungry let's get a taco
what? snap out of it
i'm sorry i can't believe she killed me

can you believe the songs they been playin'?
no i can't you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeatit's lovebeat" by little tony defranco and the defranco family i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin' grade
hardly farmers i've done some checking all these were in the war these men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them they are disciplined welltrained and have a charismatic leader if i were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what i would create
when i was coming down here i was playin' it and "the night the lights went out in georgia" came on now i ain't heard that song since it was big but when it was big i heard it a milliontrillion times i'm listening to it this morning and this was the first time i ever realized that the lady singing the song was the one who killed andy
uhuh i don't tip
whaddaya mean you don't tip?
i don't believe in it
you don't believe in tipping?
i don't tip because society says i gotta i tip when somebody deserves a tip when somebody really puts forth an effort they deserve a little something extra but this tipping automatically that shit's for the birds as far as i'm concerned they're just doin' their job
look i ordered coffee now we've been here a long fuckin' time and she's only filled my cup three times when i order coffee i want it filled six times
ahh now we're getting down to it it's not just that he's a cheap bastard 
you don't have any idea what you're talking about these people bust their ass this is a hard job
so's working at mcdonald's but you don't feel the need to tip them they're servin' ya food you should tip em but no society says tip these guys over here but not those guys over there that's bullshit
so you can't tell me anything?
fuck all that
oh that's just fucking great where's brown?
dead
goddamn goddamn how did he die?
how the fuck do you think? the cops shot him
oh this is bad this is so bad  is it bad?
as opposed to good?
this is so fucked up somebody fucked us big time
you really think we were set up?
you even doubt it? i don't think we got set up i know we got set up i mean really seriously where did all those cops come from huh? one minute they're not there the next minute they're there i didn't hear any sirens the alarm went off okay okay when an alarm goes off you got an average of four minutes response time unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that particular moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there all loaded for bear all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? those were the ones responding to the alarm but those other motherfuckers were already there they were waiting for us  you haven't thought about this?
it's going to be a long winter
i haven't had a chance to think first i was just trying to get the fuck outta there and after we got away i've just been dealin' with him
well you better start thinking about it cause i sure as fuck am thinking about it in fact that's all i'm thinking about i came this close to just driving off whoever set us up knows about this place there could've been cops sitting here waiting for me for all we know there's cops driving fast on their way here now
let's go in the other room
what's done is done i need you cool are you cool?
i'm cool
splash some water on your face take a breather
why not?
that's not correct
what's wrong with it?
the cops didn't show up after the alarm went off they didn't show till after mr blonde started shooting everyone
all of the james gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this group's cunning
as soon as i heard the alarm i saw the cops
i'm telling ya it wasn't that soon they didn't let their presence be known until after mr blonde went off i'm not sayin' they weren't there i'm sayin' they were there but they didn't move in till mr blonde became a madman that's how i know we were set up you can see that can't you mr white?
look enough of this "mr white" shit 
don't tell me your name i don't want to know i sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine
you're right this is bad  how did you get out?
shot my way out everybody was shooting so i just blasted my way outta there
a few cops
no real people?
uhuh just cops
could you believe mr blonde?
is this true brother buyl?
i can't believe this
that was one of the most insane fucking things i've ever seen why the fuck would joe hire somebody like that?
i don't wanna kill anybody but if i gotta get out that door and you're standing in my way one way of the other you're gettin' outta my way
that's the way i look at it a choice between doin' ten years and takin' out some stupid motherfucker ain't no choice at all but i ain't no madman either what the fuck was joe thinkin'? you can't work with a guy like that that motherfucker's unstable what do you think? do you think he panicked or ya think he's just triggerhappy?
i think he's a sick fuckin' maniac we're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot up the place i came this fucking close   to taking his ass out myself everybody panics when things get tense everybody panics everybody i don't care what your name is you can't help it it's human nature but ya panic on the inside ya panic in your head ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic then you get a grip and deal with the situation what you don't do is shoot up the place and kill everybody
what you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional a psychopath is not a professional you can't work with a psychopath 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next i mean jesus christ how old do you think that black girl was? twenty maybe twentyone?
did ya see what happened to anybody else?
me and mr orange jumped in the car and mr brown floored it after that i don't know what went down
at that point it became every man for himself as far as mr blonde or mr blue are concerned i ain't got the foggiest once i got out i never looked back
what do you think?
what do i think? i think the cops caught them or killed 'em
and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly as heroes
not even a chance they punched through? you found a hole
yeah and that was a fucking miracle but if they did get away where the fuck are they?
you don't think it's possible one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a 
nope
how can you be so sure?
i got the diamonds
where?
i got 'em all right?
where? are they out in the car?
no they're not in the car no i don't have them on me ya wanna go with me and get 'em? yes we can go right now but first listen to what i'm telling you we were fuckin' set up somebody is in league with the cops we got a judas in our midst and i'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here
i demand action
that was the plan we meet here
then where is everybody? i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house we ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to mr blonde or mr blue they could both be dead or arrested they could be sweatin' 'em down at the station house right now yeah they don't know the names but they can sing about this place i mean that could be happening right now as we speak the cops could be in their cars drivin' here this minute
i swear to god i'm fuckin' jinxed
what?
two jobs back it was a four man job we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop
no shit?
thank god we discovered in time we hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing just walked away from it
so who's the rat this time? mr blue? mr blonde? joe? it's joe's show he set this whole thing up maybe he set it up to set it up
i don't buy it me and joe go back a long time i can tell ya straight up joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit
oh you and joe go back a long time i known joe since i was a kid but me saying joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous i can say i definitely didn't do it cause i know what i did or didn't do but i can't definitely say that about anybody else 'cause i don't definitely know for all i know you're the rat
no you demand results they are not the same thing and if you want results you will let me do my job as i see fit unless of course  you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
for all i know you're the rat
now you're using your head for all we know he's the rat
that kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that i saw him take so don't be calling him a rat
look asshole i'm right somebody's a fuckin' rat how many times do i hafta say it before it sinks in your skull?
go down the hall turn left up those stairs then turn right
he ain't dead
so what is it?
i think he's just passed out
he scared the fuckin' shit outta me i thought he was dead fer sure
we can't take him to a hospital
can't you tell me anything?
without medical attention this man won't live through the night that bullet in his belly is my fault now while that might not mean jack shit to you it means a helluva lot to me and i'm not gonna just sit around and watch him die
well first things first staying here's goofy we gotta book up
so what do you suggest we go to a hotel? we got a guy who's shot in the belly he can't walk he bleeds like a stuck pig and when he's awake he screams in pain
you gotta idea spit it out
joe could help him if we can get in touch with joe joe could get him to a doctor joe could get a doctor to come and see him
before you got here mr orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital now i don't like turning him over to the cops but if we don't he's dead he begged me to do it i told him to hold off till joe got here
well joe ain't gettin' here we're on our own now i don't know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call 'em
i don't know anybody
well i guess we drop him off at the hospital since he don't know nothin' about us i say it's his decision
well he knows a little about me
it's going to be a long spring
you didn't tell him your name did ya?
i told him my first name and where i'm from
i told him where i was from a few days ago it was just a casual conversation
and what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
he asked
oh i don't doubt is was quite beautiful 
don't fuckin' patronize me
one question: do they have a sheet on you where you told him you're from?
of course
well that's that then i mean i was worried about mug shot possibilities already but now he knows:  what you look like  what your first name is  where you're from and  what your specialty is they ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out that's it right you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
no
if i have to tell you again to back off me an you are gonna go round and round
if we don't he'll die
and i'm very sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some ain't
that fuckin did it
fuck you white i didn't create this situation i'm just dealin' with it you're acting like a first year fuckin' thief i'm actin like a professional they get him they can get you they get you they get closer to me and that can't happen and you you motherfucker are looking at me like it's my fault i didn't tell him my name i didn't tell him where i was from i didn't tell him what i knew better than to tell him fuck fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name you buddy are stuck in a situation you created so if you wanna throw bad looks somewhere throw 'em at a mirror
enough you better start talkin' to us asshole cause we got shit we need to talk about we're already freaked out we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip
we don't think this place is safe
this place just ain't secure anymore we're leaving and you should go with us
so you wanna git bit huh?
cut the bullshit we ain't on a fuckin' playground  i don't believe this shit both of you got ten years on me and i'm the only one actin like a professional you guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers you ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? they're just like you two always fightin' always sayin' they're gonna kill one another
in english pinkerton
you said yourself you thought about takin' him out
then that time has passed right now mr blonde is the only one i completely trust he's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops
you takin' his side?
fuck sides what we need is a little solidarity here somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle now i know i'm no piece of shit  and i'm pretty sure you're a good boy  and i'm fuckin positive you're on the level so let's figure out who's the bad guy
what are you gonna do about him?
this is what he was doin'
there's a slight difference
i'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out
not these guys
yeah those guys too
there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed
oh that's really easy for you to say you're mr white you gotta coolsounding name so tell me mr white if you think "mr pink" is no big deal you wanna trade?
graham's got something to tell you might interest you
maybe he did
we're going to look for him want to come along?
i've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed
and that's more important than finding lednov?
like you said maybe he knows where my ranch is if he does he'll be waiting on the porch
nobody the light was bad
i wouldn't know did you ask her?
all i can get out of her is she don't care about livin'
can you put men at all four?
look of things she doesn't
yeah keep a closer eye on her   and him shootin' going on we'll never find lednov
maybe you won't feel that way after i tell you what i stopped in for
but i'm going to have to leave 'em here they're  well they're not the sort of people you're used to
it doesn't matter who they are
and one of 'em is sick
why didn't you say so go right out and get her ed build the fire up
no we came down the hill a little fast and  the wheel broke  can you fix it for us?
too much excitement how about the surrey can you fix it?
it was a gift from the citizens of aspen i'm mary wells
he must be replaced
no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank
i'm clay phillips  my brother steve
as far as  sonora?
just about
did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over sonora pass? it's quite a job
you can't leave us here
course i can't i'll give you a lift to the first ranch
you can stay here if you like
we have to get to sonora there are jobs waiting for us there we'll pay you for your trouble
i'm not running a stage line ma'am and i can't take a chance on losing the horses
you'll have to drive  except down hill
what is that?
too much excitement or maybe it's just the heat how about the surrey can you fix it?
i'm clay phillips  my brother steve
it's a nice place owned by an old couple named wyatt
steve and me we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp
but you eat don't you?
mostly we open a can of beans and boil some coffee
where do you keep the can opener?
in the grub box  toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard
and look at it this way how about jim  it puts him in a sort of tough spot
i'm not in his shoes so leave me out of it
why their intense hatred of you of course
would you mr phillips?
go on there's a good boy
yeah
that why you always took him on the other side of the street?
like sticking his nose into other people's business
he's learning his letters
yeah while the horses wander all over the country
are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
they're stragglin'
his letters will keep
vengeance
can we get a doctor at that ranch?
no ma'am we can't we can get a roof and a fire and maybe mrs wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people
didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
i didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded i couldn't leave her in the street let's go
hold on
we can't stay here
it's a long walk back to aspen
no thanks  i hope we won't be a burden to them
i hope so too
i suppose it is
what? oh i'mbusy
and it's not only because the trip's a tough one 
i couldn't leave you sitting by the road
you could have treated us like they did in aspen no you wouldn't do a thing like that  it isn't in you to be mean or cruel
thanks
you've earned it  the horse ranch on the toulomoe  the girl in the spotted gingham
the who?
you should know she's in your dream
go on tell me more about her
she wears this gingham dress  cooks popovers  makes jam in season  makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples
i'll make the soap myself
listen you're dating luis he's in arizona you're fucking me and we haven't made plans what could you possibly be up to tonight?
but the rest is right
will she be dark or fair?
blonde as a new mop and beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar
that's fine
it's too light yet
you're not going out to look for them?
no i'm not all i want 'em to do is keep ahead of us  a long way ahead so i'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail
not on this trail i don't i've been over it before anyway you ought to be pretty sleepy why don't you climb in back
why do you think?
i don't know i thought i did now i'm not sure i thought it had something to do with me
stop it i'm
oh it did it had a great deal to do with you
so that's it   you think i was making fun of your girl in gingham
yes but  that was the other night now  i don't think i would
maybe it's better that way
you don't mean that clay
what?
what does a man usually tell a girl?
i don't expect anything a minute ago i hadn't cuite waked up
if it's pretty speeches you want you won't be hearing them even when i mean 'em they don't come easy
save 'em for the girl in gingham just tell me i'm not good enough for you go on say a woman like me can't change
on a lot of lithium?
all right  it's said
then let's get started the sooner i get to sonora the better i'll like it
i suppose that's my fault
that's right  worry about your clothes 
there won't be any rest of the trip over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along so keep your money you'll need it for the fare i'm fed up with you i was fed up with you before we started
if you want to go on i can make it all right
like i said i was thinkin' of the horses
i'm sorry
it's going to sonora
fine  maybe i'll see you there sometime
waiting for luis to call me he said he'd call tonight oh don't be difficult patrick
i can't help how i think you're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change
hurry up
maybe they will
goodbye mary
by the way if you ever go past the wyatt ranch have another talk with elaine
thanks for loading me on the stage i know now why you did it
like i said women get in the way sometimes
to the other side of the street
why?
because well you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there tonight i was sort of tied up with steve but tomorrow i figured on doing just that
you should come have dinner with me courtney butwhen?
i haven't got the job yet
then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp
a fellow sees a fire go out all of a sudden he don't take chances my name's clayton and i'm looking for someone
so did i they were in it
she's a friend  took off this morning sort of sudden while i wasn't around
hello miss wells
it wouldn't happen to be this
which ranch?
how's that?
you've got to  don't you understand  they want me with them and they'll fix it so i have to go 
and who would you think of for such a task?
am i confused or were we talking about tonight?
no they won't
a little hot
i don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave
a man i used to know
like what?
i don't want to run short
you never said this lednov's name before that i can remember
no call to that jail looked pretty solid to me  how's she feel?
nice
the thing to do is stick to rabbits
ummm   yeah luis is calling me tonight i need to be home for that
you sure worry that bone he killed a fellow
in a fight?
the other fellow wasn't even lookin'
this is an awful nice gun  certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'
yes
at the ranch maybe?
maybe at the ranch maybe sooner than that
do you have to be so closemouthed? i'm your brother and i'm ridin' with you remember?
all right i'll tell you
and meet him there
pumpkin?
unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up
yeah  and lednov's only lookin' for one man me
why?
he doesn't like me what you eatin'?
lednov
things get tough next winter you'll have somethin' to wear
morgan blood the beat in nevada clay and me have a place on the toulomne river we're going to raise horses like these
swimming
how'd you happen to miss?
they were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin' i didn't have them to aim
yes?
good thing you didn't
that's right steve
can i have my gun back?
sure you'll find it under the wagon seat like i said before a twenty two's more your size
i won't again
i guess i have you were pretty little when they locked him up i don't suppose you even remember that time i was gone two months
sure i remember you went to mexico lookin' for cattle
you remember jeff rawson?  we used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high
sure i do went off down to mexico or something
that's what i told you then only he didn't lednov killed him
pumpkin you're dating an asshole
oh that's the time you went away
i caught up with lednov in nogales he didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came i turned him over to the sheriff and  that's the story
maybe you shoulda killed him
maybe i should but i was never much on killin' anyway he moved too quick and i just got him through the shoulder  looks pretty peaceful up ahead
yeah it does
but you never can tell why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
finished son?
there's only two of them now
i'm not but there's some of it i don't see any sense to
there's a lot of things i don't see any sense to but make up your mind learn to read or    go back and watch the horses
uh huh
just the grub box and bed rolls
you better start
that ain't why i just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life
i'll eat when i'm good and ready
kind of feeling your oats this morning i haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while but that doesn't mean you're too old
what makes you think you're so almighty? telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself
sit down and eat till i say the word you're doing what you're told
you oughta say you're sorry  that's what you oughta do
you keep your nose out of my life young fella
maybe i haven't lived as long as you have but i know a sight more about people and i wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and if i did i'd say how sorry i was i'd be man enough to do that
pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in new york
you think you're so slmighty  smart  who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you like you said yesterday  just because a man kisses a woman 
i don't care what she asked you
she told me not to fight with you anymore she said it wasn't your fault but  i figure different
you want to split up? 
you'll get your share go on i don't want you around
like i told you half those horses are mine i'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe so let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'
sure what other reason would there be?
i just wondered let's go
kind of sore
you'll live
i know stop it
guess maybe i'm old enough to hold my own in a fight huh?
yeah  but don't make a habit of it
so  maybe i'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
i guess so  but don't make a habit of it
well then i know it takes three  four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong but by that time she's liable to be in china
three men on matched roans?
the whole state's lookin' for 'em  and they're lookin' for me
all right you didn't know
i can't take her with me
nobody asked you to
pumpkin you're dating a tumbling tumbling dickweed
what's there to be fair about?
all right you didn't know
i can't take her with me
nobody asked you to
what's there to be fair about?
i don't care
suppose that lednov was to have found you instead of me why you wouldn't have had a chance
i said i didn't care
what's botherin' you anyway?
don't ask me because i won't tell you i won't tell anybody go away
patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore okay? i have to go
don't act so  crazy
i'm sorry let's go
that's a good girl
he won't take us  don't you want us around?
of course i do  but it'd be better for you  and the house is kind of small 
if you're worried about mary and me talkin' too much don't no matter how many questions your old man asks we know how to keep our mouths shut
it isn't that 
don't talk  eat  we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here
but i want to stay
drink this and stop being silly why would anyone want to live in this place you might as well be dead and buried nothing to do but look at mountains in a week you'd be talking to yourself  maybe that's what got you started in the first place
then why?
courtney? dinner?
not if i know mary when she rides into sonora you'll be with her and mighty glad to be there after this i don't see how you stood it as long as you did
stop it  stop it
darling  now i've got you all upset
that's right  you go back to sleep tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different don't you worry about anything  mary's going to talk things over with your folks 
there there don't you upset yourself 
if she says anything to them i'll kill her
me snoopin'? i came down here to take a bath
no but it's mine and i didn't want anyone foolin' with it
just a thing i was workin' on
the way you act it must be something pretty secret
i can't
you wouldn't have a smoke on you would you?
i like it
up here in the hills a man gets a hankering to smell powder
then why stay in the hills
plenty more  and somewhere up there's the lode the rock rotten with it
well cheer why don't you? no more responsibilities mary marcia  elaine  me  all taken care of down there feeding horses and raising kids you won't have a thing to worry about
well say it
yes people make me restless
even women?
there aren't any women here
i'm thinking dorsia
i suppose that's your wagon in the river
some people who went by this way lost it  two men and some women they packed their stuff on horses and went on
and you're all alone
yeah
go ahead
they went on like i told you
what do you know about that did you sell your place?
not exactly they decided gambling and dancing were bad for people  can i make it?
depends on how good you drive
thank you mr graham
dorsia's nice
they shouldn't have done that
we tried to point that out but there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason they said aspen had outgrown us it's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon
i knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws
i don't like to see you go
maybe in sonora
now where's she goin'? 
why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in aspen i told the man in sonora there were four of us if only three show up he might call the whole deal off we've got to stick together like we've always done
that's not what's worryin' me why didn't she tell us? maybe we could have done somethin'  gone somewhere else  puttin' a poor sick kid through this 
quit worryin' about elaine
and we're running out of that
nice?
there's still tomorrow morning
until pa gets around to driving us to minden
we don't want to go there
no we don't but that's where we're going from minden we take a stage to reno then another one over to auburn and another one to placerville then it's a day's trip to sonora
clay could save us an awful lot of time
he certainly could about a month
what are you waiting for? do something
how many ways can a man say no
you'd think he'd do it for elaine's sake at least
what's the use
you like it there don't you?
please maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses
go ahead  get in training for the pioneer life i'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it
maybe you are i'm not
sounds fine only that isn't how it's going to be
that's it then
i don't care what he thinks
everybody knows 
who brought you here?
stop it 
where is he?
the question is do you like it courtney? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight
up the trail
i don't know  i don't know
what for?
because there's a man i want to see
he can wait let's stay here until morning
one night more won't matter your friend'll be there anyway i don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch he knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it
i said i had a guy to see and i'm going to see him
yeah we sure have
mine's gone lame take a look at him
put on another one
okay yeah what time?
that won't help the stone bruise you ain't been around horses much looks like
will you quit gabbin' and do what you're told
lookin' around
i was at first then i was hanging on  are you going far?
i can't read ma'am i just look at the pictures
since i can remember ma'am
but he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
don't you even know your letters?
i sure would
maybe i could start you out
eight?
that'd be swell  you know you're an awful lot different than i thought you'd be
did someone say i wasn't nice?
oh no nobody said nothing to me only i got the idea that  well clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window i could see you dancing but clay always took me over to the other side of the street
good night steve
why not? you went farther than that last time
i'm too old for it miss wells that's for little kids
don't be silly nobody's too old to learn
okay abc  def  ghi 
no we're not stayin' 
that's the end of the line
pick me up?
then i know my alphabet
from a to z all you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words
without someone to teach you it's tough
there's plenty of use for reading  you'll see
unicorn  a kind of animal 
what do they look like?
hmmm sort of like a horse  with a horn in the center of its forehead
horses with horns huh do we have 'em in nevada?
no
how about california?
because he is not afraid of me
sounds like i'll have to don't fall asleep okay? wear something fabulous dorsia remember?
would they be good to eat?
kind of tough i guess but you're not liable to hunt them  i don't think there's any alive now anyways  and i'm not sure but i don't think there ever were
then if they wasn't alive how can they be an animal?
you don't read to fill your stomach poetry for instance all the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal  but they make you feel good
i feel good anyways
now i know what a unicorn is what do we do next?
oh i wasn't worrying  i saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave
and you've got me all figured out?
sure
you were supposed to be reading words
is that donald trump's car?
i was doin' both here
but you're his brother
he'll treat his wife just as good maybe better ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
oh sure
let me do that
it's a long ways yet  i figure we ought to camp she's tired
thanks steve

okay i guess it's so intimidating you know being away from home not knowing anyone i feel like such a geek sometimes everyone's so cool and i'm so not
aww you ain't that bad you just need a little flava first thing we gotta do is get you some new gear
huh?
gear you know clothing

why?
i'm going to work in washington cindy
are you?
that's where my best customers are marion berry george bush the redskins i'd like to offer you a job cindy can you type? take dictation? swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
shorty you're alive but what about your head?
that turned out to be a good thing it's gonna make smuggling a whole lot easier remember that weed? i'm about to get paid
yes it was reported but never substantiated
i'm glad you asked it actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story
professor you guys gotta see this dwight come here
it's some kind of energy field we better record this
got my camera right here
well it's not a turnon for me i have a promotion coming to me i don't want to get aids
that's fantastic our first phenomenon this is going to be a great weekend you guys better get some sleep dwight and i will take over from here
theo did you see the animal?
what are you getting at professor?
only that if this cat did attack he's less likely to come back if the two of you were let's say together come on it's college time for you two to experiment
there's something going on in this house i'm not crazy
yeah bitch give me my apple what's gotten into you?
i wouldn't go that far
why don't you shut up professor? just relax
who?
saw who?
oh god just get it over with
don't touch me
let me see the files
they're on top of the bookshelf i'll get them
i don't need your help i'm perfectly capable
are these all the subjects?
any of them hot?
good thinking dwight traumatized coeds are a sure thing
as i am sure you are aware professor subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation which is of course why i've given them special consideration
look whatever you say kid but the more they're hurtin' the more they need a squirtin' if you know what i mean  ooh i like her
cindy campbell classic abandoned personality disorder she seems guarded but willing to do this
maybe
willing? i like that  and this one?
that's ray williams i couldn't quite figure him out but he seemed very eager and excited when we met
what's this?
they are the survivors of the steveston county massacre
fantastic these kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken hell house
how are we going to get them all up there?
i'll make it part of the class we'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders
and what happens when all hell breaks loose?
we record and document it we're gonna make history dwight the first documented unrefuted evidence of life after death the book sales alone will be worth millions i'll be rich and you my friend will have one hell of a thesis paper now what time is orientation?
in about fifteen minutes
dinner at the river cafe au bar afterwards maybe
remember dwight not a word to anyone
right what about condoms?
professor
hey you're the one who brought up safety i'm perfectly willing to go in raw
would you please focus?
fine  what's all this stuff?
well this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances
yes i thought that it would be best
even in the bathroom?
that one
that's nice
after dinner you and i will take shifts throughout the night i don't want to chance miss anything
sounds good i'm just going to run up to my room hop in the shower jump into my jogging suit and i'll be right there
let's not forget folks this is a study on sleep disorders
ah yes which reminds me who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
no they're just powder burns thank god they were empty get her upstairs
what is it? some tits? a beaver shot? what?
no these are the tapes from the living room check this out
are you sure it's not the tape?
i don't think so it's on all the cameras and check this out the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded
congratulations dwight it's begun
you andluis?
it's not what is looks like she's having a breakdown help me get her to her room
what is it dwight?
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short
what?
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated in one night i recorded cold spots shifting magnetic fields the eup is picking up white sounds everywhere
that's why we came here remember?
yes but i've seen the tapes this poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent we all could be in danger i say we pull the plug
whoa dwight i say when we pull the plug get a hold of yourself dwight we're on the verge of greatness and i'm about this close to getting laid now the bus will be here on monday until then no one leaves
yeah i can see that later i want you to teach me that trick but right now we have a job to do

i don't want to talk about it
yes she bought my sister's business
that's what she told you i looked it up at the hall of records your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt
why would mrs redi lie to me?
you can't tell
can we go there now?
sister you can't just go breaking into places there's a night watchman down there and locks on the door
if my sister's in that room it won't make any difference about warrants and things i want to go there
i don't know if i want to go with you or not
which room is it?
it's the last door at the end of this hall
well you hate that job anyway why don't you just quit? you don't have to work
yes
let's get out of here
no
i'd like to get out of here
no
you could go and open the door
yes i understand

no
it doesn't matter you want to now you should want to it's your obligation your duty
because iwanttofitin
drink
no
you won't get any water and you won't get any rest you may as well drink
thank you
yes
i read your book the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking
you're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
no it's my father  i wanted to talk to you  you wrote about cures 
i thought you told me you didn't know where she was
 i didn't she came to me a few days ago to put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me she thought you might lighten that burden
i'm coming with you
hi pat bateman
if jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself
i'm afraid she can't do that ward it would endanger her
what sort of danger?
you come to me with some wild story about her being in danger  naturally i want to know what kind of danger i want to know where she is
but why? she's been ill erratic but i've never heard of anything like that
she could use a hundred dollars
i'll give you a check
she can only use cash
how much have you got?
about fortyfive dollars
oh god patrick why price? price?
for the time being i imagine that must do
oh as beautiful as ever
she's nervous naturally under the circumstances
what circumstances?
hello frances
how's miss jacqueline?
i don't know that's why i came to see mrs redi i'm trying to find her
you mean miss jacqueline's gone and you don't know where she is?
nothing's happened to her it's just that i can't understand her not getting in touch with you
i can't understand it at all
he's rich
it's on peary street just ask the people who run it they'll remember her  people who see miss jacqueline never forget her
i'll try there
but i like teaching school
well if it's fun for you it's all right i get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby
is mrs redi nice to work for?
redi's all right
she seems rather an odd woman to me
she's a pretty good sort
what does she do with herself after business hours?
i guess most people are
everybody's rich
thank you
i ought to know
what is it?
i did her hair
what were you talking about?
nothing
nothing that's absurd i heard you laughing and talking she was asking questions
she was just asking about you  whether it was nice to work for you or not
and that was all?
no she asked about the trademark
he's goodlooking
what did she want to know?
she showed me a drawing
you	fool that symbol is us  us she was asking about us
yes
noat the morgue they told me a mr gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline
the morgue? no wonder you fainted  i wish you had come to me first
then you know where jacqueline is?
but i'd give a great deal to know
why?
i love your sister mary i love her very much
everybody's goodlooking patrick
good
but i reel guilty it doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with jacqueline gone
thank you goodnight
goodnight mary
the important thing is the police won't believe you
but you have treated me that way
i won't do it again we're friends i'll never order you about again
a job?
you told me you were pretty good with youngsters today i bumped into an old friend of mine mrs wheeler  she runs a settlement house down in the village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher
i'd like that
he has a great body
it's not much money but it's enough to live on you'd have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished room
maybe the romaris might have a room they seem nice
the people at the restaurant?
yes
oh i'm making investigations
you've never believed a word i told you about mr august
look mary now that i know you better i think i can be more frank with you i don't believe you i still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale it's like some of jacqueline's stories
greg it isn't a wild tale it's true if there were only some way 
there is a very simple way got a telephone book?
who the devil is he?
everybody has a great body now
things changed mary the reasons for finding jacqueline changed i want to find jacqueline to settle things
what things? why?
we've tried so long to find her
any court in the land would understand we'll wait a few days  let you rest  then we'll go to the police
it will all be over in such a little while jacqueline and everything will be all right again drink your coffee
you'd love that jackie remember that last summer with mother in the berkshires? you used to help the gardener
good night
perhaps later when things are settled when jacqueline's well again  maybe we can arrange things differently
i don't think that's a good subject for jokes mr hoag
but i'm not joking
no i'm not why should i ?
don't be ridiculous for months i've had the best private detective in new york looking for miss gibson
but i'm better than a detective i have an understanding of people  and a love of them  an understanding of the city  
you don't even know jacqueline gibson
but i understand her that may be more important
it may make very fine poetry mr hoag but it doesn't make good sense
look here just because mrs romari asked you to amuse us
this is the part of new york i love it is old it has memories if you listen the houses will speak to you walt whitmanedna st vincent millay eugene o'neillin their time they've all lived here
i'm looking for a party  a merry party
well that's illuminating
i don't know
your hairline looks like it's receding
i suppose so i can pick him up somewhere
verse  verse that i wrote i need it
that you love mary
not from me
i'm mimi  i'm dying
no
i'm afraid
i'm not going to wait i'm going out  laugh dance do all the things i used to do
and then?
i don't know
yes  yes come with me
it's not
you will die
you know about the palladists  you know who they are  what they are i was one of them
goodbye
if you get lonely go down and see mrs romari i told her you were staying with me
i won't get lonely
yes
yes i was going to tell you to look into your own heart  do you really want to find your sister?
you will have to make all the jokes because i'm going to be very serious
yes
and you knew he'd be here
i think evelyn that we'velost touch
yes and now that i've shown you that i know that much and can guess more  will you trust me to look for jacqueline?
i want you to look for jacqueline
i have something even better
but you're always at the library
i went as a detective i found out that mrs redi reads the same books as dr judd
i don't think that's so revealing
but who is judd a psychiatrist it's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies but why should mrs redi a woman with a beauty parlor ?
i don't know
that's it and this figure she traced it the book i saw at the library had been marked "perfect" by the library inspector in march mrs redi had it out in april no one else had read it since
i'm at sea jason
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be um corrected but i have no other way to fulfill my needs
such a simple matter this figure is the symbol of the palladists
it's all clear to me now  so clear
i thought it would be but just to be sure i'll tell you that the palladists are a society of devil worshippers 
devil worshippers
i can imagine
some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about mrs redi
but it's a small room jason
it's beautiful  that searchlight  the stars 
don't make me tell you jason
i thought myself your friend mary just goodbye isn't enough for a friend
talk about what patrick? what is there to talk about?
jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man
and you believe that?
he loves you mary and you'll have to tell him
he's jacqueline's husband i can't
what's wrong mary?
jacqueline mr romari phoned me she went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before
they may have been friends of hers
i keep telling myself that
i'm a good boy but no one listens to what i say
oh the wine i have forgotten the wine
it's over evelyn it's all over
i want to see what they read so i'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents there's nothing nicer for a gift than a book
who was the first one  mrs redi?
yes dr louis judd
it's here too
no not at all mr jason
i wouldn't want to take them out i just want to look at them
what a peculiar question
i saw you with her last week i knew you'd be here tonight where is she?
my dear fellow it's neither your business to ask nor mine to tell
but why come to me?
touchy touchy i'm sorry i brought the wedding up let's just avoid the issue alright? now are we having coffee?
i don't think that you would understand if i told you
i think i understand without your telling me i know something of your history jason i know that you haven't written for ten years
i've lost my knack
i hope it finds as much favor as your other book  but somehow i doubt it  the time is out of tune
why not let your publisher judge that?
yes when i tell you
tell me what?
i'll do all i can to help i'll go to my publisher tomorrow
i wanted to get things clear for jacqueline let her know 
perhaps
i'm fucking serious it's fucking over us this is no joke i don't think we should see each other anymore
she is very young  i have an old habit of failure it would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage
a book of successful verse might have changed that eh?
it might have
i'd like that
yes miss gibson i've come to take you to your sister
you know where she is?
if i didn't know where she was could i take you to her? get your hat and coat we haven't much time
cloven hoof?
yes you know the devil and all his minions are marked that way
it will be fun meeting gregory every night at the station
but your friends are my friends my friends are your friends i don't think it would work  you have a little something on your upper lip
i don't know
i think i can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation i know too much i was jacqueline's psychoanalyst
i always thought it was a more intimate relationship
i haven't said anything of the sort
but you would like to know where she is?
yes there are certain punitive measures
i can imagine but you did say you came to me as my friend that you were concerned for me
i have no sympathy for either good or evil i have only curiosity  a professional curiosity what unhappy people most of you are
are we?	i thought i was very gay
a strange collection you're like the false god you worship fallen angels all of you
i know that your friends are my friends i've thought about that you can have them
life has betrayed us we've found there is no heaven on earth so we must worship evil for evil's own sake we're not wicked we commit no violence unless
unless what?
no you draw no secrets from me as you drew them from jacqueline you are not one of us yet you're clever louis but i recognize your interest in me for what it is worth you are only curious you have never loved a woman who had but one arm
it would be a charming experience she might only protest half as much
you're very flippant and perhaps wise but not wise enough to see the truth louis
no she's no longer under my care
we always knew you'd come to us louis
but i'm not coming to you out of deep conviction i'm coming to you out of loss i no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good
i never thought you did
i've talked nonsense i've scoffed and hooted  but somewhere very deep down in me i always felt that good held the balance of power
yes i am
you're even sentimental about it what made you change your mind?
i'm very very serious
but you have never liked jason you always laughed at him  quarreled with him 
i'm afraid not
i didn't know
leave me your address and if i find anything i'll get in touch with you
i'm stopping at the chatsworth
thank you my dear
that's too bad
this is mrs redi mary
i'm invoking rights  this man is represented by counsel  i'm coming with him
but what about the past? our past?
i'll be out in a minute
that won't be necessary i haven't much to say
why?
it will make you unhappy to find jacqueline it would put her in danger  great danger 
i can't give up looking for her mrs redi no matter what you're hinting at
i have no intention whatsoever of hinting your sister mary is a murderess she killed irving august  stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding
i don't believe it
i had to help get rid of the body you saw it on the subway and i warn you mary  go back  you don't know what you're doing or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister you go back to school   go back and forget jacqueline
but she was here?
oh yes yes one day a beautiful car comes here this beautiful lady in furs gets out there is a handsome man with her and the chauffeur  the lady rents one of our upstairs rooms the chauffeur changes the lock on the door then the lady never comes back not to live anyhow she came back three four times but always alone and just to eat
we never really shared one
yes  and pays the rent every month
could you let me see that room? if it is hers there might be something there to help me find my sister
no mrs lowood she doesn't write often
have you any other relatives mary?
we don't know mary we've been unable to get in touch with your sister
sometimes she can be quite careless why don't you try mrs redi?
i have written repeatedly to mrs redi she vouchsafes no information whatsoever  it is six months since your tuition has been paid mary naturally it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil
of course
i doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman but if  you'd like to try i'll advance you the money to make the trip to new york of course my dear if you don't find your sister you can always come back here
yes?
you're inhuman
i thought you might know her she was seen here about a week ago her name is jacqueline gibson
i don't know no gibson this is a restaurant many people come here
she's very beautiful
please
what did he say?
shhh nancy the other children
no nancy	you've got to sleep two more minutes
why
because i have something very important to do
what?
i'min touch with humanity evelyn i'm sorry  you're just not terribly important to me
i'll be right back with mrs wheeler
when?
i can quote it fully mrs redi "we will avoid violence for once undertaken violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil"
but he also wrote 
i can quote that too; "those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us and give knowledge of our being and our deeds whomsoever doeth this shall die"
i know this is difficult for you i know that you love her
what about judd  he knows about us
then it is decided leo and durk and i will make our plans
we haven't even begun tea yet
yes jacqueline you were always talking suicide   of ending your life when you wanted to
i know my behavior iserratic sometimes
it won't hurt
yes?
graham dalton
false alarm
oh well please sit down
oh no problem it can wait
yes  oh you mean to bring in no yes i have some other things no i don't need to bring them in this is all i need to stay here
oh
television?
yes
oh god i can't believe this
no why?
curious
yeah i guess it is my mother is a complete anglophile anything british makes her drool like a baby she probably heard the name in some movie she's a prisoner of public television now
oh uhhuh
are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
no i think you look fine
oh well maybe i'm uncomfortable with my appearance i feel a little out of place in these surroundings
well
i used to take great pleasure in that being purposefully different rubbing people's noses in it didn't you do that when you were younger?
no not really
i'm leaving now i've assessed the situation and i'm going
oh well i did i was in a band once and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible
you play an instrument?
no i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone the whole thing was really irrelevant how do you like being married?
oh i like it i like it very much
what about it do you like? i'm not being critical i'd really like to know
yes so you feel security stability like things are going to last awhile
oh definitely i mean just this past year has gone by like phew i hardly even knew it passed
did you know that if you shut someone up in a room and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twentyfour that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule? simply because the mind honestly perceives that twentysix hours are twentyfour the body follows and then there are sections of time your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality  for instance when i was twelve i had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship now i'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to and then were crystallized in that eleven minutes
anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned
you mean like "time flies"?
i'm just leaving
exactly i would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things or could mean lots of things
how long has it been since you've seen john?
nine years
nine years?
yes i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place
why? didn't you know him well?
i knew him very well we were extremely close until i dropped out
oh lots of reasons most of them boring but up until i dropped out john and i were very much alike
that's hard to believe the two of you seem so different
i would imagine that we are now i think i'm ready to use the bathroom finally
but where?
thank you
sister older or younger?
younger
who's elizabeth?
what's the first?
lawyers
no
okay i will
how do you mean?
i feel like they do
i have to return some videotapes
hmm well maybe you are really i wouldn't pay much attention
right right i don't feel connected to many people either other than john
it's up to you but i warn you if you tell me something personal i might do the same
okay i think i think sex is overrated i think people place way too much importance on it and i think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap i m not saying women don't want it i just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do  i'm getting confused
i think so i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love
yes yes i think that's very true very
kids? what about them?
do you want them?
yeah actually i do but john doesn't at least not right now
why is that?
you bring the cigarettes?
what are the rules for a sweater vest?
i don't know he just said he wants to wait i quit asking
do you want me to?
as long as it's not gross you know? like some scar or something it has to be like mine like something about you
agreed
impotent
you are?
well let me put it this way: i cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person so for all practical purposes i am impotent
not usually i mean honestly i haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection so i feel i'm way ahead of the game as far as being clearheaded goes
well are you selfconscious about it?
i am selfconscious but not in the same way that you are you have got to be the most attractive self conscious person i've ever seen
good coloring
why do you say i'm selfconscious?
well i've been watching you i've watched you eat i've watched you speak i've watched the way you move and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time and you know what?
what?
they are looking at you ann you are truly breathtaking i don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people men want to possess you women wish they looked like you and those that don't or can't resent you and the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse
my therapist said that 
you're in therapy?
aren't you?
hah no i'm not actually i used to be but the therapist i had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems of course i lied to him constantly so i guess i can't hold him totally responsible
so you don't believe in therapy?
i believe in it for some people i mean for me it was silly i was confused going in so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately
that's bone and the lettering is something called silian rail
well my therapist knows me intimately
you had sex with you therapist?
of course not
oh see i meant someone you've had sex with that's part of the theory
excuse me for asking but how would you know?
well i wasn't always impotent
basically yes
that's correct  bit of a dilemma isn't it?
ann hello
are you in the middle of something?
nice
nothing i can't finish later
i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished
not much to see i'm afraid i'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe
somehow i imagined books i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time
videotapes
i can see that what are they?
what kind of personal project?
oh just a personal project like anyone else's personal project mine's just a little more personal
who's donna?
donna?
i know her i knew her
donna on this tape it says "donna"
donna was a girl i knew in florida
you went out with her?
not really
all of these are interviews?
yes
can we look at one?
no
why not?
because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me
how did you guess?
the interviews are about sex ann
about sex?
yes
what about sex?
everything about sex
like what?
like what they've done what they do what they don't do what they want to do but are afraid to ask for what they won't do even if asked anything i can think of
you just ask them questions?
yes
and they just answer them?
girls dig bateman he's cq you're total cq bateman
mostly sometimes they do things
to you?
no not to me for me for the camera
i don't why why do you do this?
i'm sorry this came up
this is just so
maybe you want to go
yes i do
i know
i know
thanks guy butshe's got a lousy personality
you know?
yes
how did you know?
she said it on her tape
why didn't you tell me?
ann when would i have told you? we were not speaking if you recall
why not?
it's not my place to tell you these things ann you have to find out by yourself or from john directly you have to trust me on this
don't you want to make one?
yes but i sense the element of revenge here
ed gein? maitre d' at canal bar?
what difference does it make why i do it?
i want you to be aware of what you're doing and why because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind
what would you know about a normal frame of mind?
that's a good question
what do you have to do to get ready?
load a new tape turn the camera on
then do it
i have money
what will you do when the money runs out?
it won't are you ready?
no serial killer wisconsin in the fifties he was an interesting guy
yes
ann bishop millaney
ann bishop millaney
you are married correct?
when we're making love?
yes
sometimes afterward
does he go down on you?
it's a simple question have you ever thought of having  making love with someone other than your husband?
absolutely not
oh sure
is that all you ever have to contribute van patten? "what about fucking dinner?"
yes
did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband?
at some level i don't understand your nervousness have you decided to leave john?
then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about
i guess not
do you want me to stop?
are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
why?
because that's how cynthia thinks all she does is think about that stuff and i hate that i don't want to be like her i don't want to be like her
you're not like your sister you couldn't be like her if you wanted to
no
i know deep down i know that it just bothers me when i have feelings or impulses that she has
yes
about who?
i fantasized about you
about me?
yes
i thought i made that clear before when i said i would go down on you
i remember you could do that couldn't you? go down on me?
yes
if i asked you to would you? not on tape i mean?
i'm looking forpaul owen'splace
no
on tape?
no
why not?
if i can't do it all i don't want to do anything and i can't do it all
can't or won't?
you said you weren't always impotent
that's correct
so you have had sex
yes
no he doesn't
who was the last person you had sex with?
her name was elizabeth
so what happened? was it so bad that it turned you off?
no it was wonderful that wasn't the problem
what was the problem?
the problem was me i was i was a pathological liar or am i should say lying is like alcoholism one is always "recovering"
so you lied to her?
yes i did willfully and repeatedly
how come?
i loved her for how good she made me feel and i hated her for how good she made me feel and at that time i tended to express my feelings non verbally i couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions
are you sure?
and now you can?
now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me
don't you get lonely?
how could i with all these nice people stopping by? the fact is that i've lived by myself for so long i can't imagine living with another person it's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by and anyway i'm asking the questions are you happy?
i don't know anymore i thought i was but obviously i was wrong
did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him?
not yet i'm not sure i will i just want out
if you do get out of your marriage will you continue to be inhibited?
i don't know it all gets back to that cynthia thing i don't like her eagerness there's nothing left to imagine there's no
subtlety?
you saw the ad in the times?
subtlety yes no subtlety plus i've never really felt able to open up with anyone i mean that other person i told you about i enjoyed making love with him a lot but i still wasn't able to really let go i always feel like i'm being watched and i shouldn't embarrass myself
and you feel the same way with john?
kind of i mean john's like this kind of craftsman like he's a carpenter and he makes really good tables but that's all he can make and i don't need anymore tables
interesting analogy
i'm babbling
no you're not
god i m so mad at him
you should be he lied to you so did cynthia
yeah i know but somehow i expect that from her i mean she'll do it with almost anybody i don't know i shouldn't stick up for her i guess but him he lied so deeply ooo i want to watch him die
i'm not planning on it
no yes i mean yes i did in the times but doesn't paul owen still live here?
i'm not in love with you
but if you were?
i i can't answer that precisely
but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you
that's very flattering
so why won't you make love with me? why wouldn't you i mean?
ann are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now?
i'm asking for real i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me will you?
why not?
i've told you
there was no ad in the times
but i don't understand 
ann it could happen to me all over again don't you see? i could start to 
but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig 
i couldn't face her if i had slept with somebody else
yes
you mean you're still in contact with her?
no
but you're planning to be?
i don't know possibly
wait a minute wait a minute what's going on here? did you come back here just to see her again?
but i thinki want to know what happened here
not entirely
but that was part of it?
yes
like maybe a big part?
possibly
graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
i don't know
look at you look at what's happened to you look how you've changed don't you think she will have changed?
i don't know i really would rather not talk about it
whoa i'm so glad we got that on tape you won't answer a question about elizabeth but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life graham what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? are you going to tell her about them? i can't imagine her being too understanding about that but since you don't lie anymore you'll have to say something
don't make any trouble please i suggest you go
as i said i haven't decided what to do exactly perhaps i won't do anything
oh you just moved here to think about it right?
yeah you're right but i never claimed to know everything like you and have all these little theories i'm still learning i know that but i don't feel like i've wasted time if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now fine
why not?
because
"because"? that's not good enough i asked you a question graham i asked you "how does it feel"? how does it feel mr i want to go down on you but i can't? do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? including me? come on how does it feel?
i can't tell you like this
i'm just going to keep asking until you answer i'm sure there's plenty of tape
i don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting 
i don't care
i was all of these
i won'tdon't worry
all right all right you want to know? you want to know how i feel? i feel ashamed is that what you wanted to hear?
jesus christ ann why is anybody anything? i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad and you don't allow for any gray areas and that's what most of us consist of
you're not answering me
well what kind of answer are you looking for ann? what is it exactly that you want to know?
i want to know why you are the way you are
and i'm telling you it's not any one thing that i can point to and say "that's why" it doesn't work that way with people who have problems ann it's not that neat it's not that tidy it's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count things just don't happen that way
but why can't you just put it all behind you? can't you just forget it? all that stuff you did?
no ann i can't i can't forget it it's not something i can fix it's difficult there s something in my mind the way my brain works  god ann when you're with another person and you're inside them you're so vulnerable you're revealing so much there's no protection and somebody could say or do something to you while you're in this state of nakedness and they could hurt you without even knowing it in a way that you couldn't even see  and you would withdraw to make sure it didn't happen again
no
i'm okay it's okay
face itthe japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s
you did that?
are you going to see elizabeth while you're here?
stay away from the garden district serious crime i don't know what kind of place you're looking for but there are a lot of studiotype apartments available elsewhere
mmmmm
i called you tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in do you remember where you were?
did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
that's interesting because i didn't leave a message
who'd you have lunch with?
i ate by myself
are you having an affair?
yes naturally
jesus christ where'd that come from? i have a late lunch by myself and now i'm fucking somebody?
well are you?
no i'm not frankly i'm offended at the accusation
if i'm right i want to know i don't want you to lie i'd be very upset but not as upset as if i'd found out you'd been lying
there's nothing to know ann
i can't tell you how upset i would be if you were lying
ann you are completely paranoid not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks and you act like i'm dipped in shit you know i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on
my sister for one is that who it is?
for god's sake ann i am not fucking your sister i don't find her that attractive for one
is that supposed to comfort me?
bateman killing owen and the escort girls? oh that s fabulous that's rich
i was just saying you know? i didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love i could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair
but i'm not
i'm not either
why don't i believe you?
look this conversation is utterly ridiculous maybe when you have some evidence we should talk but don't give me conjecture and intuition
always the lawyer
goddam right i mean can you imagine: "your honor i'm positive this man is guilty i can't place him at the scene or establish a motive but i have this really strong feeling"
you've made your point
i'm sorry it's just i'm under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing it's my first big case as junior partner and i work all day i come home i look forward to seeing you and it hurts that you accuse me like that
i don't either i mean cynthia of all people she's so
what exactly do you mean?
loud
yeah jeez give me some credit
i didn't say it was rational i just said i was convinced
isn't therapy helping at all?
i don't know sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world
quitting your therapy won't feed the children of ethiopia
i know
i want out of this marriage
what?
i want out of this marriage
the message you left
why?
we'll call it uncontested or whatever i just want out
i drove around then i went to talk with graham
no but i wanted to i really wanted to partially just to piss you off
i'm not going to discuss this with you anymore you're making no sense
yes
yes
he does
not very often
you bitch i knew it
but wait harold what do you mean?
yes
nothing i mean nothing i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
no i didn't
don't you think that's a lot of garbage? i'd really like to know where it's all going to go
do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening?
ann do you see a pattern here?
what do you mean?
well last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem
yeah so?
davis i'm not one to badmouth anyone your joke was amusing but come on man you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork such a boring spineless lightweight that i couldn't fully appreciate it i wasn't fooled for a second now if you'd said price or mcdermottotherwise it was amusing now let's have lunch or dinner or something hilarious davis a killer
if you think about it i think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over
well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? i mean maybe they do but i doubt those people are in therapy besides being happy isn't all that great my figure is always at its best when i'm depressed the last time i was really happy i put on twentyfive pounds i thought john was going to have a stroke
no i don't know i haven't told him about the garbage thing because i'm pissed off at him right now he's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he didn't even ask me about it i mean i would've said yes i just wish he would've asked
what upsets you about that?
i guess i'm upset because i can't really justify being upset i mean it's his house really he pays the mortgage
but he asked you to quit your job and you do have housework
yeah i know
this unexpected visit notwithstanding how are things with john?
fine i guess except right now i'm going through this where i don't want him to touch me
about a week ago i don't know what brought it on i just started feeling like i didn't want him to touch me
what are you talking about? bateman is what?
prior to this feeling were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
oh yeah  but see i've never really been into sex that much i mean i like it and everything it just does't freak me out i wouldn't miss it you know? but anyway lately we haven't been doing anything at all like i said it's not that i miss it but i'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden
but see he stopped before i got that feeling that's why it seems weird to me i mean i'm sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile and i would except it never occurs to me i'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself
did you do anything?
did you masturbate?
god no
i take it you've never masturbated?
well i kind of tried once it just seemed stupid i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh i don't know and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage you know?
so it was recently that you tried this
well kind of recently i guess but not too recently
oh christ he can barely pick up an escort girl let alonewhat was it you said he did to her?
radon leakage?
yes it's this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and  you've never heard of this?
no i haven't
well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you  i knew i shouldn't have watered those plants
did you confront john about the visitor?
what visitor?
the friend of john's that was staying at your house
oh graham no i didn't talk to him about that actually that turned out to be pretty interesting i expected graham to be this well like john you know? i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff but he turned out to be this this kind of character i mean he's kind of arty but okay you know?
is he still at your house?
no he left last week
well you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently  no question about that
wait stop you don't seem to understand you're not really comprehending any of this i killed him i did it carnes i'm patrick bateman i chopped owen's fucking head off i tortured dozens of girls the whole message i left on your machine was true
did you find him attractive?
what do you mean like physically?
let me rephrase were you attracted to him?
i guess but not because of the way he looked or anything he's just so different somebody new to have a conversation with i'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon you know? it's just boring i don't know he was just different and he's really on about truth a lot being honest and i like that i felt comfortable around him  after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room
i've been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me
i thought that's what i did who was it that you talked to?
that guy graham i told you about he said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was well he said a lot of stuff
what do you mean? i don't understand
it's possible that graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with and he would like to see other people you for instance wallow in their situation just as he does do you think that's possible?
i guess
excuse me i really must he going
you understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
yes
that you are under no obligation to me?
yes
do you want to leave therapy?
not really
do you feel there is more progress to be made?
yes
i'm glad you feel that way because i feel that way too
but you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way right?
no listen don't you know who i am? i'm not davis i'm patrick bateman i talk to you on the phone all the time don't you recognize me? you're my lawyer
why?
because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and i just hate her she's such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? i mean it's okay and everything but i don't understand when people let it control them control their lives why do they do that?
i know but this i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex
must be nice so what's he like is he like john?
no not at all actually i don't think john likes him much anymore he said he thought graham had gotten strange
not really maybe if i just saw him on the street i'd have said that but after talking to him he's just kind of i don't know unusual
uhhuh so what's he look like?
why?
i just want to know what he looks like is all
why so you can go after him?
but that's simply not possible and i don't find this funny anymore
jesus ann get a life i just asked what he looked like
do you have to say that?
what?
you know what you say it just to irritate me
i say it because it's descriptive
well he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway
ann you always underestimate me
well i wonder why
i think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together i think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me
oh for god's sake really cynthia really i don't think he's your type
it never was supposed to he why isn't it possible?
"my type"? what is this bullshit? how would you know what "my type" is?
i have a pretty good idea
ann you don't have a clue look i don't even know why we're discussing this i'll just call him myself
he doesn't have a phone
well i'll call him when he does
but he won't
what are you talking about?
he's not getting a phone he doesn't like talking on the phone
oh please okay so give me the zen master's address i'll think of a reason to stop by
let me talk to him first
it's just not
why? just give me the address you won't even have to be involved
i don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and
and what?
and do whatever it is you do
that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune
are you getting mom something for her birthday?
i don't know i'll get her a card or something
a card? for her fiftieth birthday?
what's wrong with that?
don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? i mean the woman gave birth to you it's her fiftieth birthday 
why not you stupid bastard?
will you stop? jesus
i just thought it might 
okay ann okay how about this: you buy her something nice and i'll pay for half all right?
fine
good now if you'll pardon me i have to go to work
i was thinking maybe i shouldn't be in therapy anymore
what do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? did you tell him about me?
no i didn't
why not?
because i never got around to it
no youdidn't?
well why?
because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you don't want to get involved with him
what the hell happened over there? did he make a pass at you?
no
then what's the story what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? is he drowning puppies or what?
no it's nothing like that
well what? is he dangerous?
no he's not dangerous not physically
well what then?
i don't want to talk about it
now if you'll excuse me
then why'd you call me?
i don't know
what kinds of questions?
questions about sex
well like what did he ask exactly?
oh so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you won't tell your own sister?
apparently
did he ask you to take your clothes off?
cynthia
what?
lucky i guess
why did you do that?
because i wanted to
but why did you want to?
i wanted him to see me
cynthia who knows where that tape may end up? he could be bouncing it off some satellite or something some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it
he wouldn't do that
you don't know that for sure
well it's too late now isn't it?
did he touch you?
no but i did
oh i thought you might have a date  i don't know why i'm bothering to ask but are you going to bogey lowenstein's party saturday night?
what about oleg?
that's a wonderful jacket let me guess valentino couture?
you touched him?
you are in trouble
listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about?
i can't believe you did that
why?
i mean i couldn't do that in front of john even
you couldn't do it period
you know what i mean you don't even know him
i feel like i do
that doesn't mean you do you can't possibly trust him he's perverted
uh huh
he's harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes what's the big deal?
so he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? that doesn't make you feel weird?
no i don't think they all did what i did
you are in serious trouble
ann i don't understand why this freaks you out so much you didn't do it i did and if it doesn't bother me why should it bother you?
i don't want to discuss it
then why do you keep asking about it?
what is it?
it's a sun dress
it looks like a tablecloth
it looks so soft
it does not
hold on
thirtytwo dollars
well i can't stay
no
okay
bye
did you take your clothes off?
wait a minute do you mean don't tell me you in front of him
there's a phone here
your compliment was sufficient luis
it was busy
so will you someday
i'm cynthia bishop
do i know you?
i'm ann millaney's sister
the extrovert
she must have been in a good mood when she said that she usually calls me loud
she called you that too may i ask why you're here?
you want me to leave?
i just want to know why you're here
no luis it's not me you're mistaken
well like i said ann is my sister sisters talk you can imagine the rest
no i really can't i find it healthy never to characterize people i don't know or conversations i haven't heard i don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else last time i saw ann she left here very confused i would say and upset
she still is
and are you here to berate me for making her that way?
nope
she didn't tell you why she was upset?
nope
she didn't give you my address?
nope
how did you find me?
this is gwendolyn ichiban this is my very good friend patrick bateman where are you going? we're going to nell's gwendolyn's father's buying it  where did you get your overnight bag?
i uh know a guy at the power company
i don't understand why did you want to come here? i mean i can't imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me
well i don't really listen to her when it comes to men i mean look at john for crissake oh you went to school with him didn't you? you're probably friends or something
nope i think the man is a liar
i think you're right so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened
spooked
what do you get?
well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
not exactly
well either you are or you aren't which is it?
commes des garcon
why don't you let me tape you?
doing what?
talking
about what?
sex your sexual history your sexual preferences
what makes you think i'd discuss that with you?
nothing
you just want to ask me questions?
i just want to ask you questions
and that's all?
jesus lives luis
that's all
is this how you get off or something? taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
yes
would anybody else see the tape?
absolutely not they are for my private use only
how do we start?
i turn on the camera you start talking
and you ask questions right?
yes
how long will it take?
where are you going?
that depends on you one woman only used three minutes another filled up three two hour tapes
can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what 
no
do i sit or stand?
whichever you prefer
i'd rather sit are you ready?
just a moment
cynthia patrice bishop
describe for me your first sexual experience
my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse?
i've gottai've gottareturn some videotapes
your first sexual experience
i was eight years old michael green who was also eight asked if he could watch me take a pee i said he could if i could watch him take one too he said okay and then we went into the woods behind our house i got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying "ladies first" so i pulled down my underpants and urinated and he ran away before i even finished
was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?
no he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away to cleveland actually
how unfortunate so when did you finally get to see a penis?
when i was fourteen
live or in a photograph or film of some sort?
very much live
what did you think? did it look like you expected?
not really i didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube
disappeared  they're looking everywhere  maybe he went back to czechoslovakia
patrick?
were you disappointed?
no if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting it had character you know?
what about when you touched it? what did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like?
it was warmer than i thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked it's weird thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me i mean after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me
what did he say?
he said that my hand felt good
then what happened?
then i started moving my hand and then he stopped talking
if you wish  you're not wearing any underwear
do you like the way i look?
what? carruthers  i'll call you
yes
do you think i'm pretty?
yes
prettier than ann?
different
is that what he tells you?
he doesn't have to tell me
hi
okay
i'd like to make another tape
it looks that way doesn't it?
no? not even one more?
i never do more than one i'm sorry
i can't talk you into it?
no you'll have to get somebody else
now who the hell is going to do that for me?
i'm sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer
but i want you to do it i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody i can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything
ouch okay i deserved that cynthia don't you understand? after the first time it's just not spontaneous there's no edge anymore look at the tapes there is only one date on each label i have never taped anyone twice
so make an exception
no
that's not paul owen paul owen's on the other side of the room over there
how about if you record over the one we already made? you could have the same date and not use another tape who would know?
i would
well what the hell am i supposed to do?
cynthia i don't know
i can't believe you're doing this after i let you tape me
i'm sorry i can't do it
goddamit give me my tape then
no
i only get one today? gee how exciting
don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit if you want to leave leave my life doesn't stop when you walk out the door you know what i'm saying?
i'm not sure guy but i don't think dyslexia is a virus
meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile right?
right
why?
i hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time
i can handle it besides the money is good and some of the guys are cute and you are in no position to be jealous
who said i was jealous?
i did
could be risky
well maybe i could just start a rumor then
no i mean doing it at my house
oh who knows? they don't know that prove it
afraid of getting caught?
maybe
you should be can i meet this friend of yours?
cynthia i don't think you want to i mean you should see the way he dresses i really think he's in a bad way
i'm intrigued
you're intrigued?
sure maybe he's the man i'm looking for then i won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time
cynthia john meet me at my house in exactly one hour
you are scum i'll be there
in here
maybe it's just the light
cynthia john
not today i've got other plans
oh  well when then?
how about inviting me over to dinner?
you know what i mean
yeah i know what you mean
i want to see you
when?
right now
jesus i don't know if i can get away i've got a client waiting i'd have to do some heavy duty juggling
is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  oh my god
then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here
cynthia john
well this is timely your wife is here would you like to speak to her?
she's there? what's she doing there?
nothing wrong with trying
i don't think my sister would agree
look i'll call you okay?
what's so stupid about it?
that you you don't even know the guy
well you know him he's a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted?
what?
shit after what you've told me i don't know i should've known when he showed up dressed like some arty brat
i like the way he dresses
what if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
"the wrong hands"? we're not talking about military secrets john they're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off
jesus christ and he doesn't have sex with any of them? they just talk?
right
jesus i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people almost why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
doesn't work he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them
interact fine but did you have to masturbate in front of him for god's sake? i mean
you told ann about this?
it's a fucking milligram of sweet'n low
of course she is my sister i tell her almost everything
i wish you hadn't done that
why not?
it's just something i'd prefer she didn't know about
she's a grownup she can handle it
i just ann is very
hung up
it just wasn't a smart thing to do did you sign any sort of paper or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
no
you realize you have no recourse legally? this stuff could show up anywhere
no he is here  shit
i want to get high off this; bateman not sprinkle it on my fucking allbran
it won't i trust him
you trust him
yeah i do a helluva lot more than i trust you
what do you mean?
exactly what i said i'd trust him before i'd trust you how much clearer can i be?
it hurts that you would say that to me
oh please come on john you're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year you're a liar but at least i know you're a liar it's the people that don't know like ann that have to watch out
by definition you're lying to ann too
that's right but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister
look are we going to do it or not?
calm down let's do it anyway
actually no i've changed my mind i shouldn't have called
well i'm here now i'd like to do something
how about straightening up the living room?
did he put you up to this?
who?
graham
no he didn't put me up to this jesus i don't need people to tell me what i should do i've just been thinking about things that's all
i can't believe i let him stay in my house right under my nose that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i didn't see him
if he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure
god you you're mean
i guess you're right  that is if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay
i know will you please leave now?
maybe i don't want to leave maybe i want to talk
john we have nothing to talk about
i knew it i knew it things are getting complicated
no john things are getting real simple
it'll just be me
student?
no  you said threefifty?
plus first and last month deposit
will you lease monthtomonth?
like what?
not for threefifty
how about for five hundred?
what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
a bonfire probably
you have family here also?
you were prying before?
yes this afternoon i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon
really how'd it go?
she held up very well
what do you mean?
well we have to end apartheid for one and slow down the nuclear arms race stop terrorism and world hunger but we can't ignore our social needs either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice
i like having the car the car is important
especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry
or go someplace in a hurry
where are the tapes graham?
what tapes?
you know which tapes where are they?
john as a lawyer you should know that those tapes are private property
so is my wife asshole
she's not property john she's a person were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
what the hell do you think? i love ann you think i'm going to tell her about cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
new card what do you think?
god you need help

i knew the man emil hobbes a doctor and a professor at university i saw the girl around the building but i didn't know her she never came to the clinic
so you just came up to visit this hobbes and you found them like that?
oh no i haven't seen dr hobbes since i was in medical school he taught me he was my prof in urology and i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology that was it i had no idea he'd ever set foot in starliner towers until today
i see then what brought you up here?
how did he sound this time? was he nervous? depressed?
he sounded fine
far as i know yeah that was her
yeah that's dr st luc he's the head of our little medical clinic here
don't worry about him  think about yourself
this
medical clinic?
yeah this is an island you know? takes too long to get into the city we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains
well let's go talk to your doctor
mm? ok be with you in a sec
that's great forsythe great thanks

uh ok sure
c'mon forsythe are there any more on the list?

listen to me patrick i'm leaving
doesn't matter to me how late it is i can keep it warm
no i don't think so
well? supper at my place?
ok but late
great go back to your files bye
a man i think i recognized him a man who lives here he just  he just attacked me for no reason at all i just opened the door i was making supper for you and he grabbed me he tried to kiss me
i think i i think i killed him i stabbed him with something and he fell
will you be ok now? i've got to go to your place to see if he's still there i've got to see if it's if it's what we both think it is
oh no you're not leaving me here all alone i'm going with you
down to the incinerator
where to? are you going to go get a gram?
what do you want to call me at the office for?
i don't know i just thought i might want to call you i don't know
i won't be at the office except to sign in  i've got a lot of claims to check out all over the place garages and more garages  i'll come home right after work
nope damned thing wriggled out of my hands that's all
nick you're so strange
oh nick nick i can't take this
please janine please pleasepleaseplease janine janine janinejaninejanine
i want to be able to see us nick i i'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts ok? is that ok?  i want to be able to see us when we make love ok?
please pardon me i am niccolo spergazzi i am a resident here i don't know we were walking in the hallway and cabiria my wife she was attacked by this thing here on her arm
i hit it i hit it with my cane then i carry it on the cane and i throw it down to the incinerator down to the garbage
i'm leaving iamleaving
we live in 703
ok i'll meet you back there don't leave until i get there lock the door and don't open it except for me ok?
it's dr st luc mr spergazzi let me speak to the nurse please
oh but the nurse she went away i think she must go to look for you
just breathe normally
mr parkins what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
she had a couple just like them right here near her belly button you could push 'em around i thought they were kinda sexy myself
didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
didn't seem worried about them
was this girl from starliner towers?
don't tell memerchant banking?
yep she lived in 1208 but we usually went to my place bigger liquor cabinet bigger bed  she was gone when i got back from my last florida trip too bad had a beautiful tan  must have gone home to mother
was her name annabelle horsefield?
that's the one
gonna cut me open?
well let's wait for the xrays
used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did  cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants gotta admit that
you touch my spleen rollo  and here all the time i was thinking  if i ever bothered to think about the good old days  well at least there's rollo he's in vd and he's happy
i'm still a vd man under the skin rog you know me i'm a downtoearth kinda guy right?
well at least you still talk the same
so who changes?
no you dumb son of a bitch i'm serious i'm disappearing
but you gave up your private practice suddenly you're into pure research and you you're what a parasitologist?
that was my father's idea private practice he wanted to set me up  i couldn't say no but he's dead now and me i'm still a snoop i gotta do research look at that beautiful stuff  lookit it
did i say anything?
look you got men you got parasites that live in on and around men now why not breed a parasite that does something useful? eh? why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? why not for example a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? if it takes a little blood for itself so what? be generous you can afford it
it's crazy
i don't get it
you know and i know that hobbes was a lousy teacher eh? lousy dry academic afraid of women lousy but he was always a genius at one thing  getting grants could he get grants for crazy projects?
rollo you know me once a gp always a gp
you want to help sick people for the rest of your life? god forbid i should talk you out of it
you oughta be careful yourself might end up cutting your throat
where to? morgan stanley? rehab? what?
it was women did it to hobbes couldn't handle them that girl that annabelle  talk about crazy projects
who was she?
aw he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school they caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge she was twelve don't ask it was craziness believe me  they used to come here sometimes  don't ask
ok i'll think about it
that you rog?
yes?
it's me rollo linsky remember me?
rollo how'sa boy? i was just thinking about you
no? how come?
listen rog i knew hobbes was funny you know? i told you that but i didn't really know just how funny he was see when he kicked off they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother  she's still alive but just barely  and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab i'm hobbes's partner right?  anyway i've been going through his papers and what they add up to is this: hobbes was shafting us all me the university the foundations and the councils the private labs everybody we never really knew what it was we were working on hobbes gave us each a few crumbs but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like
i'm just a happy camper rockin' and arollin' van patten  rehab's done wonders for you pal working for unicef now?
it looks like  and i quote  'a disease to save man from his mind'
i don't get it
lemme clarify for you
huh?
maybe hobbes didn't know it but annabelle was a pretty popular girl around starliner towers i've got three men here maybe four who're hosting large freemoving apparently pathogenic abdominal growths that nobody i've tried can identify you were next on my list
i'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys
i've got a date with one of them at ten can you make it?
yeah  ah i don't want to panic you or anything but i mean the way hobbes designed them they're supposed to get out of hand real quick so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream i dunno but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive maybe even bizarre sexual things
yeah? what do i do then?
i dunno try tranquilizers once you can get at them there's a lotta stuff you can use i'll bring a bagful it's just the standard tropical kit but the trick is to get at them
ummyesi know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eightthirty perhaps?
ok rog see you at ten
night night
it's time for byebyes it's been a great day thanks a heap now it's time for everyone to go to sleep

what about my movie rights?  book rights?
yes can you take two tonight oh let's say at nine o'clock?

i got it  i got it
congratulations  it's 'happy homes' for harry and emily weiss of denton
you got it
i got it  i got it
i'm janet majors and this is my husband brad
he needs help
looks like 'rest home' for this marriage
oh really? that's great
i've caught it once or twice
of course  dtv's most popular hospital series featuring those perennial favorites cosmo and nation mckinley neurospecialists par excellence if you'll pardon my french i recommend you send brad to them for treatment
it's no use pussyfooting around janet  we have to cut quick and deep
on the contrary  he wants to see your ratings soar  he needs a woman of exceptional desirability
can i just 'peep in' on brad before i go home?
home?
after breakfast  you're sounding tense janet  maybe i could give you a little massage?
well first you go rip rip rip then you go snip snip snip then you whip in a zip zip zip an' you split it up to the hip hip hip an' as you strip strip strip you quiver and shiver for that soft caress as you slip slip slipinto that little black dress
little black dress
jah  you endorse his product  he endorses your research
i said we are totally booked
i am in farley's employ  and  we're discussing a network deal
why janet?
everyone loves the girl next door particularly farley
so it seems
they probably meant irving and wanted you to swing
no it wasn't janet  exactly  it was in fact your new sponsor
sponsor
dentonvale has been sold
sold??
farley is already a tv winner as we shall see  dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene
two at nine? perfect
who trusts experts?
show yourself  the real you the secret you
i detect a note of reticence are you perhaps one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
well betty there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly
judge wright?  now betty? first name terms surely
oh oliver you're so tolerant time for a coffee before you rush off?
delighted betty  that is if you don't mind being seen with an older man
why oliver since ralph and i separated maturity is something i look for in a man
everything's free there
isn't that brad and janet majors sitting down front?  what an ideal couple
there are no tables available tonight the waiting list is also totally booked
bert brought them over from europe  they had a very popular series together  it's still rerun in a lot of countries  you must have seen them in 'dentonvale?'
it's happened before  remember lieutenant orpheus?  he disappeared into that underworld series and never came back
sounds like my husband  he never came back either  at least not after flavors gave him a commercial break
ah yes  farley flavors  you know i find it
closed?
now betty don't overreact
overreact  you're the one with theories about conspirac  oliver?
yes betty
are you spoken for this evening?
it pays to know your way around oliver
see you then
oh i adore coleridge taylor  as a matter of fact
yes  macabre isn't it  the blind leading the blind
yes betty  but the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset
indulge?
in a little masquerade?
he was a president
president?  past presidents betty this is beginning to add up
really  what'll i pin this on?
faith betty  but make sure it's your own
some people do it on the pavement
aerobics class sorry any messages?
not at all  you have your life  and i have mine
yeah well  here betty  i just came to give you this
shove it ralph
you too betty
no  i don't know what janet's next move will bebut you can be sure of one thingit all starts here
i don't want to get up there
we've got to brad everyone's watching
what are you trying to do?  make bert look like a fool?  he's made all the arrangements
but i don't need treadment
i'm looking for trade
ricky hendricks has to cancel today he didn't say what he was canceling or why
some people do it for the fashion
some people do it to be funny
some people do it for the money
you've lost your cause
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you've lost your mind you've lost your grip so say byebye
i've took as much of you as any man can
you've lost your heart
you've lost your cause
you lost your baby when you lost your balls you've lost your mind you've lost your grip so say byebye
some people do it for for their lovers
i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club anyone else?
some people do it for for improvement
some people do it for movement
some people do it for for enjoyment
some people do it for for employment
tenderness and innocence in denton`
he was adopted you know
i'd forgotten
well i hadn't  i was worried about inherited craziness when they married  i said to janet 'what do we know of his parents?'
he moved all right  when they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of wilson's bakery
wellmaybe i could wear my black leather brogues?
andspencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier 17
too flashythey'll clash with the new outfits
the art will start when i play my part as the healer who will steal your heart
sure thing
we've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight  is this true?
absolutely correct
could you tell us a little about it?
let's just say that i'm putting sanity back on the national menu
and how does *'local girl'* janet majors fit into the scheme of things?
of course
that doesn't make sense
look i haven't really focused on that kind of thing
when?
the question is does brad want to see you?  quite frankly he hates you
what do you mean?
who?
he's a lame dog remember?  but even he wouldn't want to see you like this
oh  mom  it's brad
i know
it's
just what the doctor ordered  i know  come on in my favourite show's just started
what show?
thank god he was born an orphan it would have killed his parents
after six
why?
your father doesn't like mexicans
janet  where's that lovely dress i made you?
oh mac ran up this little crowdpleaser
you're practically naked
i can't wear anything under it that would spoil the line
i'm sorry officer
vance  vance parker
janet  janet majors  it's just that bradmy husbandis not very well and  i don't want to miss the next episode of dentonvale
dentonvalesay that's for  i'm sorry to hear that janet  look i'm going to let you through but keep it to yourself otherwise
negative cancel it
thanks officer parkvance
don't worry janet  brad'll probably get just what he needs
our raving saviour that's you
young blood
i need some
young blood
i need it now i need some
young blood
i need some
young blood
justsayno
good  well there's still hope lots of hope
nocouldn't i do this later?
there are countless people in this world who believe they're happy
me?
it's classical  almost a textbook case
i understand your concern but i feel it's time you started thinking of yourself  look at yourself
absolutely true  compared to all of them you are perfection flawless beauty
if only brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me
he will  but it's up to you to reawaken his feelings  you've got to be fabulous look think and appear fabulous  and farley's given you that chance  you can use the breakfast show to knock denton dead
do you really think so?
just say no?
you've got a really tight team around you  and everybody needs you
but what'll i do?  what'll i say?  what'll i wear?
ever since i was a little boy dressing up has always been my greatest joy but when it's time to be discreet there's one thing you just can't beat that's a strapless backless classical little black
of course  he was in great danger of harming himself
i'm sick of hearing about that lame dog  i've got a lot going for me  i'm going places  i'm going to be someone  i'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if i have to kill to do it  i'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me i don't even know why i'm wasting my time here with you  i should be with my people
arrest that man  he's committed to our care
i never signed the contract  he's not going anywhere
farley
f for
flavors
yes sir
f for
fabulous
f for
fast
f for
foods
we understand you've been going through a rather trying time
i can't wait to begin on him really bert i don't know what we'd do without you
i don't think he intends to go that far
what does he know about it?
no silly forget it i'll make them thanks
yes how are you janet?  are you happy?
yes janet  leave the crying to brad
and you can 'peep in' on brad in the morning
you're no good
you're no good
what a joke
you fel like choking you play for broke
you play for broke
he leaves you smoking
oh romance is not a children's game
i'll do it
you keep going back it's driving you insane
criminal
siniful
in the old series we didn't have a convertible
ah macy  why don't you help janet freshen up before rehearsal
surely
and an attractive financial prospect for denton
like a deep plum lipstick and some therapeutics
this could take us to a town that's nowhere near here
no
no no be a doll and just get me a perrier okay?
we're not confused
mommy and daddy love you baby
she walks in beauty
we love you baby
we all love janetwho do we love?
it's all in the wrist  you know you look really familiar you from around here? where'd you go to high school?
no we're from san diego why?
i don't know you just seem really familiar to me never mind enjoy your meals
hang on did you ever know a derek sommersby?
doctor derek sommersby? you mean from "one life to live"?
you look nice today
i'm a bad girl i'm a bad girl
i picked him up and i fucked him i'm a bad girl
and you liked fucking him didn't you you fat little whore?
i liked it when you caught me fucking him
the wallet he took derek's wallet
it'll just take a second
you guys having fun?
good that's good
just seeing how you're doing and um mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again and we're wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans or should he be at one of the singles tables?
well then put him at the singles table
what's your cut?  how much?
is that the ransom file? thanks don't wear that outfit again
the problem with that is that then there's one extra 
then put him with the feldmans whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me
don't dismiss me i'm trying to include you in this decision he's your friend
i didn't dismiss you i told you what i thought but it didn't seem to matter so you decide besides this is supposed to be my time with miles i hope you're not going to call every five minutes
i'm not going to call every five minutes but this is important
honey i'm just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding isn't that the point of this? isn't that what we talked about with dr gertler?
i don't know christine perhaps it's because i feel attacked
i ask you one simple question and suddenly i'm attacking you
listen i'll call you when we get there and we can talk about it then okay?
bye
ummmwhat? i didn't hear you
i love you
bye

huh
i'm sorry miles  so i don't know where that leaves us i'm not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it i think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now  a fabulous book with no home the whole industry's gotten gutless it's not about the quality of the books it's about the marketing
i said "do not wear that outfit again" wear a dress a skirt or something
yeah i'm here
i'm sorry miles we did all we could you've been a real trooper  tell him i'll call back

100% pinot noir single vineyard they don't even make it anymore
pinot noir? how come it's white? doesn't noir mean dark?
jesus don't ask questions like that up in the wine country they'll think you're a moron
just tell me
color in the red wines comes from the skins this juice is free run so there's no skin contact in the fermentation ergo no color
sure is tasty
oh yeah yeah
and?
i liked it a lot a lot of improvements it just seemed overall i don't know tighter more congealed or something
can you bring mr
how about the new ending? did you like that?
oh yeah much better
there is no new ending page 750 on is exactly the same
well then i guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different
i've just got to make one quick stop won't take a second
what?
i thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother
your mother? jesus miles we were supposed to be up there hours ago

it's not worth it you pay too big a price it's never free
i'd rather have a knife
no no you've been officially depressed for like two years now and you were always a negative guy anyway even in college now it's worse  you're wasting away teaching english to fucking eighthgraders when they should be reading what you wrote your books

jack this week is not about me it's about you i'm going to show you a good time we're going to drink a lot of good wine play some golf eat some great food enjoy the scenery and send you off in style
and get your bone smooched
whatever's closest man i need a glass
these guys make topnotch pinot and chardonnay one of the best producers in santa barbara county  look how beautiful this view is what a day
i thought you hated chardonnay
would you like to accompany me to dinner?
i like all varietals i just don't generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california  too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation
thanks jack so do i  here we are
i told you filet and salmon
yeah but how are they making the salmon? poached with a yogurtdill sauce? teriyaki? curry?
i don't know salmon don't you always have white wine with fish?
oh jesus look at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference
let me call christine
doesn't have to be now let's go taste
i owe her a call anyway
now we're talking
oh no i have no plans
good yeah it is a rose only this one is rather atypically made from 100% pinot noir
pinot noir? not again  you know not all pinots are noir
what color is it supposed to be?
depends on the varietal just get a sense of it thick? thin? watery? syrupy? inky? amber whatever
huh
now tip it what you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim tells you how old it is among other things usually more important with reds this is a very young wine so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly now stick your nose in it
i don't know wine? fermented grapes?
now set your glass down and get some air into it
when do we get to drink it?
now
well isn't this a coincidence
usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities but this one's pretty damn good  this is the new one right chris?
yeah that would be a good move
want some?
just a minute
it's not even a mile
we should have driven
not with the wine list these people have we don't want to hold back
you think i'm making a mistake marrying christine?
whoa
come on do you think i'm doing the right thing? tell the truth you've been through it
let's not think about what i want how about anywhere you want
well you waited for good reason and you proposed to christine for some good reason so i think it's great it's time you've got to have your eyes open that's all i mean look at me i thought victoria and i were set for life
christine's dad  he's been talking about bringing me into his property business showing me the ropes and that's something considering how long it took him to get over i'm not armenian so i'm thinking about it but i don't know might get a little incestuous but mike does pretty well a lot of highend commercial stuff
so you're going to stop acting?
no way this would just provide some stability is what i'm saying i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there you know keep myself in the game in case something big comes along
uhhuh
we're not getting any younger right? and my career well it's gotten pretty you know frustrating even with my new manager maybe it's time to settle down
if that's what feels right
it does feels right
then it's a good thing
yeah it's good feels good
oh patrick i can't make this decision
pour us a couple
it's going to be great here's to us
you know her?
sure i know maya
you know that chick?
jack this is where i eat when i come up here it's practically my office and sometimes i have a drink with the employees maya's great she's worked here about a year maybe a year and a half
she is very hot
and very nice and very married check out the rock
this gal's married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara
so what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? obviously that's over
no come on anywhere you want
you don't know anything about this woman calm down let's just eat okay?  the duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the highliner pinot
well she does know a lot about wine
ooooooohh now we're getting somewhere
and she likes pinot
perfect
jack she's a fucking waitress in buellton how would that ever work?
why do you always focus on the negative? didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
she works for tips
you're blind dude blind
well i'm tired aren't you tired?
no  no way
oh i can't  i don't know
the chick digs you she lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published
now i've got another lie to live down thanks jack
i'm trying to get you some action but you've got to help me out just a little bit
didn't seem to me like that's what was going on you were all over her
somebody had to do the talking and by the way i was right she's not married
how do you know?
no rock when she came to the bar sans rock
shut up
she probably went home lit some candles put on some relaxing music took a nice hot bath and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator
oooh oh miles miles
come on where do you want to go? anywhere you want just say it i can get us in anywhere
fuck you
so what's the plan today?
we head north begin the grape tour up there make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel
ooooh now the cards are on the table
yes they are and i'm serious do not fuck with me i am going to get laid before i settle down on saturday do you read me?
sure big guy whatever you say it's your party i'm sorry i'm in the way and dragging you down maybe you'd have a better time on your own you take the car i'll catch the train back
no see i want both of us to get crazy we should both be cutting loose i mean this is our last chance this is our week it should be something we share
beautiful
victoria and i used to like this view  once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 opus one with smoked salmon and artichokes but we didn't care
miles
oh i don't know no we'll go anywhere you want
she has the best palate of any woman i've ever known she could even differentiate italian wines
miles i gotta tell you something victoria's coming to the wedding

is she bringing him to the wedding?
dorsia isfine
what do you think?
you drop this bombshell on me why didn't you tell me before?
because i knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you we're here to forget about all that shit we're here to party
i'm going to be a fucking pariah everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if i'm going to get drunk and make a scene plus tony fucking levin?
no no no it's cool i talked to victoria she's cool everyone's cool
you've all been talking about it? behind my back? talking about it?
i'm a quick learner

you have the keys
what?
you didn't give them a name
she called maya who's not working tonight so we're all going out

we were supposed to play golf
you go in fact use my clubs they're brand new  gift from christine's dad  it's on me oh say by the way stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the hitching post tonight and sit at one of maya's tables and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all 
count me out
oooh i see didn't go so good last night huh? that's a shocker you mean getting drunk and calling victoria didn't put you in the mood? you dumb fuck your divorce pain's getting real old real fast dude

i'm on a diet but thank you
right now
okay jesus
lucked out  got voice mail everything's cool
yep
what're you drinking?
upstairs getting cleaned up
what the fuck are you doing?
what?
with this chick
um not exactly but i've been honest i haven't told her i'm available and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days besides
you don't need to lose any weight you're kidding right? you look great very fit
well i don't know just the wedding
what?
well i've been doing some thinking
oh you've been thinking and?
i may have to put the wedding on hold is all
deep
understanding of what?
like i might be in love with another woman
in love? twentyfour hours with some winepourer chick and you think you're in love? and give up everything?
look who's talking you've been there
you can always he thinner lookbetter
yes i have and do i look like a happy man? was all that drama with brenda a happy thing for me to do? huh? was it? is she a part of my life now?
this is totally different i'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about that's the distinction i have not made the commitment yet i am not married i have not said the words in a few days i might get married and if i do then i won't be doing stuff like this anymore otherwise what's the whole point of getting married?
and what about stephanie? she's a woman  with a kid a single mom what do you think she's looking for? huh?
here's what i'm thinking we move up here you and me buy a vineyard you design your own wine; i'll handle the business side then you get inspired and write a new novel as for me if an audition comes along hell la's two hours away not even
you're crazy you've gone crazy
what do you care anyway? you don't even like christine
what? of course i like christine
you said she was shallow yeah and a nouveau riche
that was three years ago after that first party
look miles all i know is i'm an actor all i have is my instinct  my intuition  that's all i have and you're asking me to go against it and that's just wrong
but it's
well maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner i don't want to ruin your willpower
sure whatever maybe i'll catch a movie
yeah
she's working i need a break anyway she's getting a little clingy  this is our day
nope
she likes you man stephanie'll tell you
can you give me some room here?
oh yeah sure
thanks jack
you're an asshole
nope
no it's all right i'm not very good at controlling it anyway
what do you think's going on?
could be anything
been checking your messages?
obsessively
huh
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response i guess i'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life
but you don't know yet so your negativity's a bit premature wouldn't you say?
shut up
just trying to be helpful  it's all about stillness miles inner quiet
why are you so hostile? i know you're frustrated with your life right now but you can choose not to be so hostile  here
well i'd like to travel and maybe go back to school but i really don't knowi'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities but i'm so i don't knowunsure
i don't know got it from stephanie
hey asshole that's not cool
throw me his ball
i don't want to talk about it
all i know is she's beautiful lots of soul perfect for you i'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your johnson?
is what the money thing?
with maya
well yeah that's part of it woman finds out how i live that i'm not a published author that i'm a liar essentially then yeah any interest is gonna evaporate real quick if you don't have money at my age you're not even in the game you're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir
is an abattoir like a like a what is that?
slaughterhouse
no not really
abattoir huh but you are going to get the good news this week about your book i know you are i can feel it

i'm going to need an operation maybe a couple of them they have to wait for it it to heal first then they break it again
good thing you have a voiceover career
gonna fuck that up too i should sue her ass only reason i won't is to protect christine
that's thoughtful
yeah
huh let me think
well i guess i do for a long time i was too focused on my work i think but now i've really begun to think about changing myself you know developing andgrowing
you sure you didn't say anything to maya?
sure i'm sure and just what are you implying? i'm really pissed off at you about all this if you want to know the truth what's maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? you're the one who's sabotaging me not the other way around pal not by a longshot
looks like you were in a bad car accident
what's that?
i'm thinking it's time to settle down one woman one house you know it's time
uhhuh
i don't know i wouldn't know
you're joking right?  what are you doing? unfucking believeable can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?

no i'm okay
hey why don't you invite maya to the wedding?
somehow i don't think inviting maya to your wedding is the right move in fact after your bullshit it's going to be hard for me to even go to the hitching post again
what's that?
you're so negative
i'm fine you rest
i feel like driving
nothing buckle up okay?
you said it looked like a car accident
what the fuck
i'll pay for it

oh no oh christ no you don't
you need a new car anyway
oh uh tape duct tape ineed it for taping something bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun
whatever sorry

i finished it
good for you
the windmill
see you
a fiddlehead sauvignon blanc
sorry 
oh yeah? how is it?
try it
twelve months in oak
on a sauvignon blanc?
i know the winemaker she comes in the restaurant all the time
this is good little hints of clove
i know i love that
that's what i'm having
fine just slipped  this is my blood
hey
jean? what?
she got anything good?
oh yeah steph's way into pinots and syrahs  hey steph? you sure we can open anything? anything we want?
not much of a collection really i haven't had the wallet for that so i sort of live bottle to bottle but i've got a couple things i'm saving i guess the star would be a 1961 cheval blanc
you've got a '61 cheval blanc that's just sitting there? go get it  right now hurry up
yeah i know
it might be too late already what are you waiting for?
i don't know special occasion with the right person it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary
how long have you been into wine?
i started to get serious about seven years ago
what was the bottle that did it?
make someone happyhave you ever wanted to?
eightyeight sassicaia
i think they overdid it a bit too much alcohol overwhelms the fruit
yeah i'd say you're right on the money
yeah siena's a sweetie
is she sleeping or?
she's with her grandmother she's with steph's mom she spends a lot of time over there steph's well she's stephanie
who me? nah i'd just fuck them up that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce  no kids
yeah same here
yeah i know it's kind of weird out of context
yeah weird but great
hmmmm
yeah definitely
well it's a little difficult to summarize it begins as a firstperson account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke kind of based on personal experience but only loosely
what's the title?
"the day after yesterday"
oh you mean today?
um yeah but it's more
so is it kind of about death and mortality or?
mrnmm yeah but not really it shifts around a lot like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father and some other stuff happens some parallel narrative and then it evolves  or devolves  into a kind of a robbegrillet mystery  you know with no real resolution
wow anyway i think it's amazing you're getting it published really i know how hard it is just to write it even
yeah thanks
i know i should go i know i have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men andi mean do you want me to go?
like me i have this stupid paper due on friday and as usual i'm freaked out about it just like in high school it never changes
a paper?
yeah i'm working on a masters in horticulture chipping away at it
horticulture? wow i didn't know there was a college here
i commute to san luis obispo twice a week
so you want to work for a winery or something someday?
well
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car it's not fully proofed but if you're okay with a few typos
oh yeah who cares? i'm the queen of typos  wow this is really starting to open up what do you think?
my palate's kind of shot but from what i can tell i'd dub it pretty damn good
this is not about money emil  i need your trust in me
no no i guess not i don't want to get bruised you're right i should go
can i ask you a personal question?
sure
why are you so into pinot? it's like a thing with you
what about me?
i don't know why are you into wine?
i suppose i got really into wine originally through my exhusband he had a big kind of showoff cellar but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate and the more i drank the more i liked what it made me think about
yeah? like what?
like what a fraud he was
yeah
got it
thanks it slipped my mind completely
i had a good time tonight miles i really did
good so did i
okay see you around
um did you still want to read my novel?

he's an actor so it can't be good
oh just that he loves her that she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world how he adores siena how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to
patrick? is that you?
i'm sure he believed every word
but you wanted to fuck me first
oh maya no

it's miles listen i don't know if you even care but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did i think you're great maya  always have from the first time you waited on me  and while i'm at it i guess you should know that my book is not getting published i thought this one had a chance but i was wrong again don't bother reading it  you've got better things to do so you see i'm not much of a writer i'm not anything really the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand we're leaving in the morning and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you i'm sorry i'm really sorry

justsayno
i see
it's called probing it's a military procedure you send a reconnaissance group very small to check out things not to engage but to evaluate the situation evaluate the level of danger make sure things are all clear
clear for what?
you got two minor league home run records don't you?
boy why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of t and a?
this is not an intelligent way to approach this
curse and stuff
i'm not going to curse
you don't mean it it's just for show
it doesn't sound natural when i curse
what is it patrick? are you alright?
just make noises then
explain noises

no i'm not
you want him coming in the house next time?
i heard
yes it was

it's broken morgan it'll just keep doing this  let's get out of the car okay?
that's right
i got him
yes
how can you say that?
that wasn't the answer you wanted?
can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? give me some comfort?
yes
what does it matter then?
what do you think i do?
what's furry furry rabbit?
that's a game isn't it?  anyway  there's been some interesting developments
what time is it?
eleven am they're gone
the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell
already thought of two other birds did the same thing an hour later not as dramatic they lived but you could see they hit something
ray reddy's house
did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
good choice i'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon  extra bacon
they already know we're here
a model? an actor?
while they were trying to fix her up all she kept asking about was you
we have to go in the basement
should we make a run for it out the back?
they're right behind the door
what are you doing?
he was trying to eat a second chocolate bar your grandma said "no" he tried to take a bite so i grabbed it
i'm sorry i hurt your arm
i'm looking
got it
from what?
no flattering but no
me too
it's getting stronger
i'm close
it came on about two hours ago woke me up  we won graham
they think over a hundred thousand they're just estimates  but we held strong
how do they know it's over?
a mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning it's eleven now  they're leaving beat
listen there's things i can take and a couple things i can't and one of them i can't take is when my older brother    who is everything i want to be starts losing faith in things i saw your eyes last night  i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again okay? i'm serious
have they said anything about our area?
philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared but who knows for sure?
i need to know about your background  i need to know about your upbringing  why you're here
well
i know  we need to be sure before we open that door graham
me too
graham
don't
yes
it needs batteries
edgar come inside
i have some upstairs
it's old morgan
we can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this
i m into well murders and executions mostly
don't do it
it gets clearer the higher you hold it
oh
they tell you everything in this book
who wrote this book?
that means they're unemployed
bimboo?
dad
i just asked his name
yes they would invade us using only ground tactics hand to hand combat they wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them
well most guys i know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it
what's two?
they win
sounds made up
where are we going to sleep?
the family room
we'll keep her in the garage after dinner
now we're talking  how about you merrill?
don't yell at her
you're scaring your sister
i hope they're doing better than we are we don't even have helmets
that'sthat's too bad
yeah baby i think someone did
don't call me father
what's that?
don't call me father it's just graham now
sorry
the footprints
what about them?
there are none
what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
what was the first thing?
you think i'm dumb don't you?
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior sometimes violent behavior theo henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow
sounds like a virus
no father they're edgy on alert like they act when they smell a predator around peeing on themselves and everything
it does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
i don't know whether to look for a midget or a 
he definitely wasn't a midget
okay  so he was tall?
i would say so
edgar it sounds as strange to me saying it as it is to you hearing it but we couldn't see him he stayed mostly in the shadows all we could make out was movement  but i'll tell you something with absolute certainty there was someone watching our house last night he was looking in my children's windows and i want you to find him edgar  i need you to take this seriously just in case it is something serious
do you owe anybody money? you can tell me off the record if you need too
what?
no
no
six months
it's left its mark still the last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world take them into town get their minds  your mind on everyday things it's good medicine
it's good advice  say hi to marcia for me
you take care of yourself  graham
he wasn't drinking ray fell asleep at the wheel
yes that's the first thing colleen asked too
why not?
see father ray's truck swerved off the road and ah hit colleen and then a tree she was pinned between the two
you think i'm dumb you think all models are dumb
pinned? what does that mean?
what did you say?
yeah
you'll lose the signal
it's like war of the worlds
they think it might happen all at once
don't worry
what book
they'll find a way in
posse? what the hell you talking about?
no i really don't
my partner and me robbed the bank in turley and headed out with a posse on our tails my partner there caught one a ways back and i think he kicked off while i was looking for this damn canyon you're dawson ain't you? i'm tex larue  used to ride with ry morris you know him well andy sims told me there was a hideout here so i headed for it hope you don't mind
wait a minute if you don't believe me ask them  they saw me and my pal in turley before we did the job
no money eh?
the money's in my saddlebags over there but i ain't stepping out to get it
what do you mean the horses?
howdy jake what's going on here?
you got me this is a crazy town emmett i think we ought to get out of here
that's why they got you in jail?
yeah i kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words so i decided to get out of there
and you had to kill him?
that's okay i don't mind there's something sweet about you
no no no i winged him and he dropped his gun
you're in here for winging a guy?
what friend is that?
the one with the shotgun
honest to god emmett he would've killed me
there's nobody coming?
your next water ain't for three days
it was my fault
mckendrick
did it seem short to you?
hello 
sounds good
all right then  let's go
wait a minute get down off of there augie
where were you?
chicago working in the slaughter houses
yeah maybe so long
sure
someplace safe how you feeling?
i didn't just come along i was looking for you  jake said you were out there i saw him in town and he told me about that business the other night said you boys took a henry off one of mckendrick's men i wanted to see it
that's it
give me another one please
isn't it ridiculous? coming all the way up here but you know they really are the best
i'm sorry
you'll never make it
have to
be careful you're in it now and it's gonna get mean
so far that's all i seen in this life
where's jake?
mckendrick's men got him
is he alive?
she was hurt pretty bad  emmett they took the little boy with them
right
then why can't they get these stains out? i mean can you talk to these people or something? i'm not getting anywhere
have you thought at all about your plans?
some i've been talking to the parkers one thing i know i'm not doing  i'm not going back
they've been kind to me
paden sends his best
i guess i put a good scare into him
i just came out to say goodbye
goodbye?
yeah me and jake will be heading out for california soon
that's why i'm here
didn't paden tell you that?
oh yeah oh i get it fun with chocolate
yeah that must have been it
this is a brutal land
you must have known that before you came
it's one thing to know it
how's mr parker doing?
just like you'd think but he's not going to run we're sticking to our plan now we both need help
i already did that
this time you're really going?  you know where i'll be
that i do
i'm afraid it is a bad start friend 'cause my name isn't baxter and he ain't hawley
listen if you could talk to them  i would really appreciate it i'm really late i have a lunch appointment at hubert's in fifteen minutes
you're not baxter?
my name is emmett
and you're not baxter either?
this is where baxter and hawley brung us
well they're wrong this territory is full of bad characters
and they were two of them look 
in my town when you're looking for someone you ask me
all right i'm looking for a young fella full of juice about my size wears a fancy twogun rig
ten am
right i thought they always did it at dawn  so long kid i'm sorry
yeah well oh boy listen i've got to go thank you uh victoria?
i haven't done anything
i want you out of town before the hanging
i'll be long gone
you got no idea what they were after?
not for five years
no leavenworth
i've never been in there they just jumped you out of the blue?
i had to get up anyway
me i'm riding along minding my own business four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while friendly as can be i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is don't make much difference we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me i guess they admired my horse she's a great one a sweet little bay
looks like that's not all they admired
maybe we could have lunch one day next week? you know i'm downtown near wall street quite often
yup the whole rig i don't care much about the rest but i surely will miss that bay least they didn't kill me that was right considerate i thought they were laughing when they left me thought it was real funny i walked for a little while but there was no use so i gave it up figured it was just bad luck
where's the pinto going?
i gotta stop by turley and meet a guy
where's turley?
south of here past chimayo
maybe i'll go along as far as chimayo get me some clothes maybe a bath
yeah maybe a bath
and bridlewise too she's the only thing i lost i really cared about  'cept for maybe my hat it's a great one got a pretty silver band on it my head spent three years training it  i surely do miss that hat
going to turley was it?
gotta meet a guy and head out for silverado
oh i don't know victoria i'm at work all the time
it's a town
they got a saloon there?
i expect
women?
i expect
which way do you mean?
he is that
i hate to see any man swing bad luck
bad luck for me now i gotta bust him out of there
i understand
well what about oh you know maybe a saturday?
it's not going to be easy
it never is but he's my brother  we're going to california together but first we're going to stop in silverado and see our sister and i can't show up there with a story like this
no hard feelings
c'mon i'll buy you a drink
you haven't got any money
all right you buy me a drink
anybody got any ideas?
oh i was just checking the ah  you know lookin' in
i'll be around
yeah?
next saturday?
all i'm saying is you won't trip over me if you look her up
i'm going to california with my brother
pleased to meet you sheriff
last one to the midnight star buys
i've got a job
i saw the light i thought maybe rae had come back to see me but i never thought it'd be my boy i never thought that
she's gone gone to town she hated working on the farm  just like you
what happened?
they run me off they burned me out they made it so i couldn't do just like georgia if you won't sell they take it anyway
who?
yeah
the cattle this valley runs down to a clear creek that's why we picked this spot and that's why they don't want us here
you own this land
i paid the government for it all right that don't mean much out here  malachi i'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills hiding out afraid to walk my own land
what about the law?
whose law? the law here runs a man down  just like these cattle
tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all the next day we'll be back here farming and these cattle better be gone
i don't believe in luck i know what conrad was like don't tell me what you think i want to hear
never will again
we got married just before this trip so we could come out here and try the land it's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that
and a pretty lady
my father always degraded me  killed my selfesteem  and my mother was blind
if you had an american express card she'd give you a blowjob  listen this girl worked in a tanning salon need i say more?what do you do?
believe it
they're drawn to me by that but it never lasts
why?
because they don't like what i want
what's that?
i want to build something make things grow that takes hard work  a lifetime of it that's not why men come to a pretty woman
half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force
the problem is emmett you killed the wrong mckendrick
why jt watch what you're saying around augie emmett didn't kill anybody
his son is worse than he was he's smoother so you don't always hear him coming but he'll do anything to keep his range free
uh huh?
i'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back
i can't say i'm convinced you're going anywhere
sure we are we're leaving at dawn
i've got no reason to run it was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses
yeah that's what happened with me too
the other guy drew first
right
we didn't get that far
blind pete taught me a great trick
what now?
she's fromfrance
we wait
he'll be here
he is now
who is he?
oh a guy who got run out of town
all i did was kiss the girl
that's what you said in turley you remember how that ended
what's the matter paden? you afraid i couldn't get those two behind me?
i don't want you getting anyone in my place
let's get out of here
he's a goddamn drug dealer these are his peak hours
howdy
give the man a line of credit he already owes the house thirteen bucks
we're going to make some adjustments i wanted you to be here when i offered paden your job i think he could do it without getting greedy stella and i are tired of you skimming our profits
i'm done talking get out
you can't do this
really?
i wanted a drink and a bed i guess i came to the wrong place
came to the wrong town i don't tolerate this kind of thing it's hard on the peace and it's hard on the furniture now knowing a bit about carter here i'm going to let you go without paying for the damages but go you will and i mean now
is there a place in town that takes my kind?
you misunderstand i want you out of town in fact i want you all the way out of my jurisdiction
don't tell him you're here
that ain't right
i decide what's right in this jurisdiction now move
this nigger's breaking up my place sheriff langston
i don't like that word much carter
we don't serve them here and you know it i asked him to leave and he went crazy on us he owes me money for this damage
is that a fact?
don't press your luck carter
we'd rather stay
we'll see about that i'm sheriff john langston as you may have guessed i am not from these parts
you're kidding
why would i?
but the good citizens of turley have taken me in their embrace and for one simple reason i maintain the peace so when strangers come to town i always ask them their business have you come for the hanging?
so this is the guy you're going to hang?
tomorrow morning ten o'clock
i was afraid of that
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family
daddy's dead
who did it?
i'm not sure but i got an idea and when i am sure they're going to pay
oh that's just fine where were you when ma and daddy needed you? it's too late mal now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed
it's none of your business
you're at paul owen s
rae all we got is each other
i don't have any family any more
rae i need help
why come to me?
because you're my sister there's nobody else  the men who killed daddy are after jake i gotta talk to him
what's stopping you?
they're watching the hollis place i can't get through
what makes you think i could?
why would they stop you?
because i'm your sister
who?
shut up you need help don't you?
good luck mal
because they enjoy it
i heard from stella you were trying to find jake what happened to emmett?
you don't know?
lucky
where's emmett now?
he's good all right too good for my men that's why you've got to take care of it
what about his brother?
we'll handle that he's careless
paul owen
i heard that too
did you hear his son is still around?
hello paden how ya doing?
it's been a while
where's the dog?
let's talk about that  i'm looking for some men
i've given that up
so have i i've got a legitimate job now i can use a guy like you
you've got a legitimate job
yes sir you wouldn't believe it
i want the number idiot  anyway i'm at paul norman's and i'll try you later and if i don't see you at canal bar tomorrow night i'm going to sic my hairdresser on you
you're right
well i'm real happy for you cobb but i think i'll keep looking for mine
i just got to town
stella we still got an extra room out back don't we?
luck i guess
good old paden i was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job
you didn't tell me you owned a saloon
maybe we ought to ask stella
this is a lot of money
i told you this was a sweet setup
your mother was blind?
no
it is that
maybe you could run it without stella
well thanks but forget it
you know paden what makes all this work is me doing my job the fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble it's going to take a little straightening out i have my responsibilities i want you to understand it has nothing to do with us
nothing do nothing don't get between us
i'm a great believer in doing nothing
so we understand each other?
don't worry about me if you're taking on emmett the last place i want to be is between you
yeah maybe i will too
i thought we talked about that
do you have any coke? or halcyon? i'd take a halcyon
we didn't talk about this  they took the little boy cobb
i saw how you're putting mal johnson straight
cobb you've got nothing i need
i'm not thinking about your future paden i'm worried about stella
what's she got to do with it?
not a thing she's just a mutual friend  but if you wind up on the wrong side of this she's going to get hurt
yeah bad luck  goodbye cobb
goodbye paden
i run the place what can i get you?
the world is what you make of it friend if it doesn't fit you make alterations
patrick you re a lunatic
i'll drink to that will you join me miss 
stella
paden
i am i'm always there but i only shine at night
thanks that's what i call it too
and i know what i'm talking about
you like a good saloon?
it's the only place i'm happy
me too what's wrong with us?
you see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
come on don't you find christie attractive?
socalled?
yeah aside from being a loudmouthed lying cheat he's just the man i would have picked
why'd you go into business with him?
i don't own this place the man who does stuck me with kelly
who's the owner?
here he comes right now
i'm saving lives here the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather
i meant seemed like a lot of whiskey
that's the good stuff
oh yeah? how good?
let's not get lewd  i'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation
give me some of the good stuff
he left me
what do you mean?
cobb's got something on you and it must be pretty good
if he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening
you sure? maybe that's the kind of friend i am
nah  what's he got? this is a nice saloon but there are other nice saloons it's not the money not for you why can't i get ahold of it?  cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about
is that what he said? well he figured it okay this time
i like your attitude but it can be risky
i'm ready for that
come on i think it would be a turnon
i don't want you to get hurt
he can't hurt me if he's dead
you better get in there with her until this thing is over
that was my plan
oh yeah you two are going to get along fine you got a lot in common
i wouldn't worry about that
i thought you two would get along
he says he doesn't care about anything but he does there's just no telling what it's going to be
that's right  you understand perfectly  i will confess to fraud not murder
a fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions  also bogus?
does he do this all the time?
oh no  the fan club is real  but they were worshipping computer code  ones and zeros
so of course you couldn't kill simone because there never was a simone
of course
and this mr hank aleno who you talk so much about a renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead  perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent simone is an invention himself?
who?
it wasn't her body  it was her body of work
why don't you just come clean viktor?  tell the truth  you'll feel better afterwards
i am telling the truth
we all know what happened  in a fit of jealous rage you killed simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you
no  i can prove it to you  i'll take you to her
no i'm not a lesbian why do you think i'd be into that?
no i understand  that's what i want to talk about  i don't know if you know this simone but viktor and i were married once
i can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go  i owe viktor everything
i think he owes more to you  but that's not important now  i know what's going on between you two
i want to reassure you elaine there's absolutely nothing going on between viktor and i
you don't have to protect my feelings simone  i don't blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world
i'm not   he's not
damn   yes  i    i'm just a little tired listen elaine viktor and i  it's strictly a working relationship  we could never be anything else  we're just so different
exactly  you're a household name now  you're moving in entirely different worlds  that's why i hope you're not toying with viktor
it sounds like you still have feelings for him
we have a daughter together  i just don't want to see viktor get hurt
well you went to sarah lawrence for one thing
i don't know how many times i have to say this elaine but viktor and i are not in love  i only make love to the camera
simone i recognize the shirt you're wearing  i gave it to viktor on his birthday
okay  for you
thanks  this is my exit so i 
i'm glad we talked
goodbye
we don't need a name  we'll cast an unknown
excuse us
difficult  i'm difficult
hmm mike and ike's
those are sarah lawrence guys patrick you're making me feel weird
not just any mike & ike's  cherry mike & ike's  do you know why i viktor taransky twotime academy award nominated director 
 viktor that was short subject
 overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career am walking around with a pocketful of cherry mike & ike's?
 i'll tell you why  it is because miss nicola anders supermodel with a sag card god's gift to cinema has it written into her contract that all cherry mike & ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room and that any time she travels her nanny must fly with her first class
 what's wrong with that?
elaine she doesn't have any children  don't you see?  we're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the alist
the public decides who's on that list
please
it's the truth  those 17 superstars are our insurance policy  we can't open  can't make a profit without them
we can hardly make a profit with them  upfront salary backend deal perks per diem percentages  they're mocking us elaine we're at their mercy  we always had movie stars but they used to be our stars  we used to decide who would play what role we told them what to wear what to say who to date  when they were under contract we could change their names if we wanted to  more than once
yeah she went blind giving birth to me she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me
you actually listen to whitney houston? you actually have a whitney houston cd? more than one?
you realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
well i do remember why i started out in this business  you seem to have forgotten  working in new york with cassevetes  we were trying to do something important shine a light in that darkened cinema 
 it's called a projector
 illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth
listen viktor i have good memories of those days too  but this isn't about that or you or me or some highminded ideal  this is business
spare me
 christ viktor look around what do you think pays for all this?  this is about investment and return  those days in new york that's it's over
how can i?  your last three pictures tanked  the board is giving me hell  no bankable star will work with you after this  if you just compromised a little
you can have everything  office car assistants  all i want is the picture
the picture's dead
no i'm sorry i should've made an appointment  was that anything important?
so there's no problem  i can have the rights the negative too?
they're yours  but how are you going to finish it?  without a star there's no movie
i don't need a star  all i need is an actor  i'll reshoot the part cut out nicola and replace her with a real actor  a real leading lady
even if you find her you know the problem with unknowns viktor  if they're good they get known  and then you're back to sorting their candy and worse  i'm sorry viktor
good to see you too elaine
why isn't she with you?
why?  because she would never show up at something like this  she's intensely private
don't thank me  it was entirely simone's decision  do you have simone's check?
i don't have it on me  anyway it means a lot  have you read the reviews?  they're love letters  listen to this one  "simone has the voice of a young jane fonda the body of sophia loren the grace of well grace kelley and the face of audrey hepburn combined with an angel"
almost right
oh that? just mulling over business problems examining opportunitiesexchanging rumors spreading gossip
i can't wait to meet her
i don't know if that's going to happen
why not?
as i say she's something of a recluse  that's how she's able to stay so pure  by isolating herself in her art
don't be ridiculous  i arranged a press conference
out of the question  a circus like that?
viktor it's my studio
she's my actor  there are other studios elaine  there's only one simone  leave the press conference to me
no problem  do you want to come in?
why not?
hi pat bateman nice to meet you
"forever"
whatever  i still haven't received simone's script notes
there aren't any  if the filmmakers are happy simone's happy  she considers herself an "instrument"
really?  oh so she's really going to do all this nudity?
if it's on the page
she'll drive herself
hair and makeup?
she'll do her own  theater training
she was in the theater?  when? where?
i'll send you her resume
i'm sorry to barge in on you like this but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he wasn't in andwell you're here soi know how busy you guys can get
al least a contingency for wardrobe  any woman can go up a dress size
 i guarantee she won't gain an once  she's very disciplined
well we have to do something about this  "stuntwoman"
what about it?
there isn't one
no need  she does all her own stunts
even the fall from the plane?
even the fall from the plane
well shoot it on the last day
which accounts for your percentage  when do i get to meet this dream?
i've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen
not today  she's learning her lines  you can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget
i'll walk you out
elaine talking to you now not as viktor director but viktor ex husband what the hell happened to you?
experience viktor  i've seen this a hundred times  young stars destroying the very people who discovered them  i'm worried about you that's all  this woman  she controls your destiny
simone does not control my destiny
viktor i have a feeling  one of my feelings  there's something about her i don't trust
thank you  what did you think lainey?
that's genius viktor  was that simone's idea?
who else?  it's always simone's idea
better late than never
you're not with the fbi or anything are you?
i should fire you more often  the film's looking wonderful
you really think so?
yes  to be honest i never quite saw this film before  maybe it's the way simone is playing it  but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how that's the only way we can love  i think it's really going to mean something
thank you  i'll tell simone you liked it
i'd love to tell her myself  when are you going to let me meet her?
soon  soon
everyone i know has met her viktor
everyone you know is lying
that's true
 we have to talk to her viktor
nothing like that i'm just a private investigator
not now  she's emotional  her mother dies today  scene fortytwo of "good for nothing"  it's not a good time
 i can explain
 i don't think that's necessary i think it's perfectly clear  i should have guessed  it all makes sense now it's why she never goes anywhere never seen in public
viktor you should have said something
she doesn't want pity
you're so good to protect her like this
oh make it live  please viktor
i'll try  maybe live but remote she'll never go to them
she said you were very beautiful
really?
ah i seeyes paul's disappearanceyes
elaine what are you doing tonight? would you like to go somewhere  dinner?
i'd love to  but aren't you supposed to meet up with simone?
oh yes  of course  don't i always?
no
no of course not  why?  would you care if we were?
well yes  from a studio point of view it would be better if simone stayed single  anyhow i thought she came across great tonight  intelligent well informed a natural  and touching she was spectacular
thank you
do what?
whenever i compliment simone you take the credit
i do?
so it's nothing that official i just have some basic questions about paul owen about yourself
yes you do  anyway tonight was a good start
excuse me?  start?
it's a crowded summer  we need every photoopp soundbyte and column inch we can get  good night viktor
lainey and i just wanted to congratulate
she's lying down  she's exhausted
i can imagine
is it wednesday?  it's wednesday how embarrassing  i don't know what i was thinking  with all the excitement lately  am i interrupting something?  are you expecting company?
as a matteroffact i am
when is she coming over?
about now  would you like a drink?
back in the czech republic?
coffee?
i suppose i could stay just until she arrives
not quite
i'm sure you'll keep her focussed she's lucky to have you viktor  is she really having your baby?
impossible
i just read somewhere 
i know  i know  they'll say anything
 and she was positively glowing at the awards  i should be going she'll be here soon 
i want you back too viktor
i would rather have you than simone  believe me
that's sweet viktor but i couldn't let you do that  make that kind of sacrifice  it's strange  i've stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where i am  it goes with the territory  but for some reason i can't betray simone there's i don't know any other way to say it  there's a goodness to her
no i'm okay
no there isn't  there's nothing to her
oh viktor  you say that now  because we're here alone like this  but in the morning you'd go back to her  what man wouldn't?
no i will end my relationship with her  totally
but you don't understand  she'll always be there  at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen
no  she'll never work again  retire never make a movie or a record or appear ever again
of course she will  her public will demand it
not if i don't let her
you?
every actor is an invention viktor  don't embarrass yourself no one's denying that you discovered simone  but it's like finding a diamond in the desert anyone can trip over it but it's not the finder who sparkles
 no no i didn't trip over her you don't understand 
perrier? san pellegrino?
 you just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you maybe she's staying out of pity who knows?  she certainly doesn't need you  some people even say you're holding her back
who says that  ?   never mind  you have to listen to me elaine  simone is thin air pixels molded by me from a mathematical equation  i inherited it from a madman  i can show you 
how much wine have you had?
 she's a figment of my own imagination  i viktor taransky have perpetrated the greatest hoax the greatest sleightofhand sleightofmouth sleightof sleight in entertainment history and still no one appreciates me recognizes what i've done  even you
you're drunker than i thought  are you doing that again?
no  whatever talent simone has comes from me  me  me  i swear as god is my judge  you don't know what i've been through  tens of thousands of mindnumbing hours in front of that screen nights without end and look what it's cost me  why do you think i've been wearing these?  i may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight and why?  to extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being  a human soul  don't you see?  i made simone
how can you bring that up at a time like this?
don't thank us too fast viktor you know what we have to do?
why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
exactly  now that you have the studio behind you we can really do things
no i'm okay
that sounds wonderful  how do you feel about all this lainey?
no it's life
hello is this elaine?
yes  oh my god  is that you simone?  i've been wanting to talk to you
well here i am  you look pretty today  red suits you
where are you?
right beside you  i borrowed viktor's car
sometimes  but just when i think your father's changing for the better i realize he's as self absorbed as ever  he took the credit for simone tonight
it was a great show dad
just a minute
mr kimball a bottle of san pelle
because obviously she existed right?
i know it as surely as you're sitting here sweetheart  she was the most vital woman i ever met
so you did meet her?
of course  what are you suggesting?
i mean really meet her  in the flesh
well i 
 we don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too
lainey there's no evidence that simone isn't real
listen to what you're saying mom is there any evidence she is?
he also happens to be the most talented man i've ever known
oh no i'm okay
why?
obviously this can't last  she's going to dump him  viktor won't be able to take that  he's too sensitive  it'll destroy him
elaine do you realize you can't stop talking about viktor?
i have to talk to her
no thank god for you mr taransky  how many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
of course
you look so so
 so much like her?
yes of course but very beautiful in your own right
i do find myself physically attracted to you mr taransky
it's no problem
do what you do to simone
what i do to simone?
yes call me simone
simone?
yes yes again again  do what you do to simone  i want to know what it's like to be her just for one night
you're with me to be close to her?
is that a problem?
please put your clothes on
i just think actors talk too much does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening friday?
of course the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more
the disappearance of paul owen
you don't secretly want the attention?
i'm not even sure i deserve it after tonight i'll have almost as much screen time on your show as i do in my movies  how is that healthy for a performer?
who are you really?
that's a good question  as nietzsche said "whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else"
let's talk about the work that you care so much about
sure  where would you like to start?
how about the nudity?
nudity has just never been an issue for me frank  for me clothes are just an option
what exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
i suppose the thing i like most about the movies i'm in is that they're not about special effects
oh right well i haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything  not on "page six" at least
frank you know as well as i do living in a fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media
we all do  but now i understand you're eager to get back to work  and not the kind of work that we're all expecting
that's true  i can reveal that i am considering a career in politics
and what may i ask brought this on?
it's a remake hal  anders is not bigger than this picture
hello hal
the film  the chemistry  no reflections on nicola but simone and i  we were just so right together
you never were together hal
and still the connection was undeniable  i haven't read "eternity forever" but i know it's brilliant  and i know i would be perfect for clive
clyde
i think his family wants this kept quiet
yes perfect  as a matter of fact i ran into simone on the lot the other day
really?  she didn't mention it
i'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now  she is just as you described her viktor indescribable  i strongly sensed she thought i was right for it
it was more in passing
you're so far off  hal hal sinclair your co star  remember now? no i don't think he's put on weight  anyway you think he's right for "eternity forever"? not the right type? a different direction  i'll try to talk her into it
body double
for her?
for you  i want you to know simone appreciates you all working for scale  but why am i thanking you? simone can thank you herself  she insisted on speaking with you before filming begins  she's on the line now
viktor clyde simply has to get close to simone in this scene  he has to touch her  he has to
absolutely not
yeah yeahbad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind  and my father blamed me for her blindness
understandable  lime?
but she's right there  i must feel her
you can't
why not?
there's a wall between you 
 an emotional wall i know that's why 
 no  no  a real wall  you ran right through it
how did the wall get there?
i can't explain it to you now  you'll see when it's all put together  anyway we got it a couple of takes ago  let's move on
i'm fine hal  how are you?
somebody said she was here
no really i'm okay
i know what you mean
i have to talk to her about my experimental film  it's very experimental
simone
 please get away from me
i did it mr taransky  i licked skin  i licked hair  i licked every part of her
you want me to call security?
i have her mr taransky  the answer to your prayers  the answer to this
i was misquoted
i have your new leading lady   right here in my pants
that's right  you were booed off the stage  that's got to be  ?
you sure? i can always get you a lime
 eight years ago  in that whole time i never left my computer
good for you hank
good and bad  they think that's what caused this  me eye tumor microwaves from the screen  it's the size of a grapefruit  heavy too
i'm sorry
don't be  it was worth it
i've seen them all before
not like this 
come on hank  a synthespian virtual actor  ?
 we call them "vactors"
i need flesh and 
shoot
 flesh is weak
 a living breathing actor  i can't work with a fake
that's the point hank  no matter how good they are they're still mickey mouse  everyone's tried everyone's failed  it can't be done
it can  with my new computer code you and me we can do it together
i don't know anything about computers
that's why you're so perfect  you have something i don't have
what's that?
an eye  for performance  you know the truth when you see it  i know  i've seen your movies  i love your movies
you do?
"straw god" changed my life
how old are you?
you saw that?
i've seen every frame of your work you're the only filmmaker in hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision you and me art and science we are the perfect marriage
listen hank it's been a rough day  i'll call you about his next week
i won't be here next week  the tumor's inoperable  i'll be dead
i'm already dead
i just came out to support my good friend simone
there's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
we've been seeing each other sure but we'd rather keep our relationship private
do i hear the sound of wedding bells?
i can't believe you people  no wonder she never comes to these things
twentysix i'll be twentyseven in october
hello sweetheart
it's really not anything lainey  it's just 
don't feel too bad  mom runs the place and they still walk all over her  you're better off out of it
you look very grown up  what are you doing?  you meeting your mom for dinner?
i know you'll do it dad  you're viktor taransky
hello lainey
she's at the premiere of "a cold day in hell"  but i think she send someone from acquisitions
she still with kent?
this week anyhow
 you finished the film on your own terms that's what matters did you really do all the post yourself?
where did you go to school?
there was no other way
i missed you  i wondered if you were ever coming back
me too
well i can't wait to meet simone what's her last name?
you know i don't know
is she here tonight?
she can't watch herself
i saw her picture on the er internet  you really didn't notice anything  unusual?
only her brilliance  to be honest with what you had to work with i was expecting a train wreck  you really pulled it off
why?
harvard the harvard business school
those things can be dangerous staring at a screen all day  you miss what's going on outside in the real world  you can lose yourself you should get out more  how are you going to meet boys?
i know plenty of boys
really?  who?  where do you meet them?  in a chat room?  how do you know he's not some middleaged freak?
dad i can spot a middleaged freak a mile away
okay  but you have to find a way to escape that thing
i do
how?
i read
you do?  still?  i can't tell you how happy i am to hear that
you were the one who insisted on it  reading me dostoyevsky and joyce when i was four
your address?
you understood them  that's what was amazing  it's a nice day  let's eat outside
if anyone asks about simone 
 i know i don't know anything
exactly  don't you wonder where i'm really hiding simone?
i'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important
i know hal is as stiff as always
no not that  i was just wondering  in the bedroom scene in reel two why did simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
precisely
night lainey
i do okay  how about you?
fiftyfive west eightyfirst street the american gardens building
you know me  married to my work
i noticed
really?  too bad
she thinks you're with simone
lainey you know simone and i don't have a real relationship
i know but mom doesn't  maybe if it came from simone if simone spoke to mom  she could straighten things out  dinner maybe
dinner?  dinner's difficult  a phone call?
too impersonal  they have to meet facetoface
i'll see what i can do  you know lainey  i don't believe you've ever once asked to meet simone  don't you like her?
i love her but that doesn't mean i need to meet her
i think you're a freak  i think you do this to torture me  and i think you suck
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
nice very nice
i love you too daddy
she did didn't she?
it's fantastic  it's too much
it's the car she drove in "eternity forever"
i know  thank her for me
it's from both of us  of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit 
why not?  i can get you something else  what do you want?
the old viktor taransky  i liked you better before  before all this  you were a loser dad but at least you had integrity  i can't stand to see you like this  clinging to simone's coattails  it used to be about the work and now it's all about her  and then she's not even grateful enough to thank you
no that was me
there you go again blaming yourself  can't you see what she's done to you  she's taking advantage mocking you  you deserve better than simone  i've got to go dad
thanks
lainey
me and simone  what i did
your mistake wasn't making something fake daddy  we're fine with fake  as long as you don't lie about it
i could get the death penalty
you certainly will if you go to trial  a jury in this kind of ugly mood  you've killed an icon for god's sake
i didn't kill anyone bernard there was no one to kill
an insanity defence
what?
it was premeditated  i knew exactly what i was doing  i strangled her  i bludgeoned her i set her on fire  i did it  i killed her
max sayer  national echo
who do you ask?
don't you have a real story to write?  why aren't you in latin america?
this is the story
i remember when the echo had class  the paper that could bring down governments
our leaders aren't presidents anymore  they're pop stars and screen idols  if woodward and bernstein were alive today they'd be right here in hollywood with me
they are alive sayer
maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity sayer  look it up
who's the hostage sayer her or you?  you look kind of "captive" yourself  while you're spending every waking hour obsessing over simone guess what i guarantee she doesn't even know you exist  get off my property or i'll call the cops
the cops?  the cops read my column to know who to bust  we're the only watchdog the public has  none of this is going away  we'll be here tomorrow and the day after that  until you slip up  and you will  you are looking at your shadow  because all these elaborate precautions with simone  every instinct in my body tells me it's not natural
i'm just trying to help you sayer i don't want you to be disappointed  it gets cold out here at night
nice try  if we can't get to her through you maybe your family will be more cooperative  i can guarantee you taransky one way or another miss simone and i are going to get acquainted
you seemnervous
i'd like to see that sayer invite me
it's a yacht
i know what you're up to
i don't have time for this sayer
i think you do  i know it's a fake
the background is
she was never in new mexico  she never left the studio
 i bet you have
 i've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done the video in the supermarket there's no evidence she's ever left the studio  oh and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail  but i have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts  i know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her
i'm keeping it in trust
i know i'm sorry
i know that's what you'd like us to believe  but i got to tell you  embezzlement is a serious matter not to mention abduction
abduction?
i don't buy the whole recluse scam how are you doing it?  what is it  drugs?  blackmail?  mindcontrol? all three?  what do you do  keep her locked in a box somewhere?
i want to see her  unless you show me simone live and in person i show these pictures to the authorities
er good
looks familiar doesn't she?  no one comes from nowhere taransky you turn over enough rocks
she looks a lot like you
she hasn't uttered a word that whole time  until she saw the big show
that won't be necessary  sooner or later i knew you'd crack this thing max  you got me
i do?  sure i do  can we speak off the record?  i'm a fair man  i'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story
no i guess it's okay
i wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics
no  thanks  absolutely
don't you?
this should take care of mother
maybe he's talking to himself
taransky isn't that good an actor no they're taking special precautions  some kind of new encryption
why?
whatever it is it's dark
dark?
yes very
you sure?
24hour tail on taransky?
shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes every concierge and maitre d' on the take  but this simone woman is good
obviously the name isn't real  she's using an assumed identity travels under a false name checks into hotels with an alias  she never stays in the same place two nights in a row  anything on the satellite photos?  what about the fingerprints?  what happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
which means they're significant  incriminating  perhaps criminal  she's hiding her past  she's hiding her past
my god you've got one?
i will when you're finished writing it
long live the first amendment
sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth  as for a photo  if you can't do it i know twelve million people who can
what do you want  ?
mr sayer did we pay the million bucks yet?
no problem 
 cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning  worth every penny too  who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  we'll be running stills of this for months then release the whole tape  we'll get our money back  maybe show it on an exclusive payperview event do you realize what we have here? we have the only independent footage of simone in existence
we used to
is that why she left you?
i don't understand
could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
you're in breach
 is this about the new pages?  i made the changes you wanted you're in virtually every scene 
it's not the size of the role viktor  am i or am i not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
it's the biggest on earth  i swear  it's a 50foot airstream  they don't make them any longer than that
taller viktor
well
taller?  what?
i had three other offers  i only signed on to this picture out of loyalty
then show some  they'll shut me down
it wasn't working anyhow  the scene with the thousand geese  i don't understand this film  i don't think anyone will understand it  i already put out a press release  citing "creative differences"
yes
i never apologized properly for what happened on "sunrise"
after i saw what simone did with the role  you know i fired all my people went into rehab took acting classes changed my whole look  she really inspired me
yes i'd like that
thank you
you could play the lead
i'mat a loss he was part of that wholeyale thing you know
but that's simone's part
yes of course it is  you know you have a line here  not a wrinkle  actually more of a dimple  i've been thinking of incorporating something like that in simone
you'd cosmetically alter simone to look like me?
no of course not you're right that would be crazy
good
is miss simone coming today?
she's already here  she arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone  remember under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission
what if it catches on fire?
let it burn  simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy
perfect  god i'm so relaxed around you
yeah he hated me from day when i was born  put it out  can you put the cigarette out?
yale thing?
i'm sorry i didn't catch that what did you say?
i'll do anything to please you mr taransky
i certainly am mr taransky
 what you don't understand 
good morning mr taransky
a star is
 digitized
buy it?  they're paying for it and around here that's how you really know they buy it
do you have any idea what this means simone?  our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it
i am the death of real
what do you meanyale thing?
you are birth of what?  a phenomenon  a miracle  a new era in show business  all i wanted to do was finish the film
and now look what you've started and now look what you've started and now look what you've started
yes  yes it is
no  i just helped bring someone else's dream to life
mr taransky we both know i was nothing without you  i was computer code  ones and zeros
you're right  you're right  of course one doesn't want to boast it's a classic case of technology in search of an artist  that's all you've been waiting for an artist with integrity with a vision who can see
are you ever going to tell the truth about me mr taransky?
the only real truth is in the work
you know what i'm talking about
yes  yes i'm going to tell the truth about you why wouldn't i?  of course with hank's tragic passing the secret died with him  i am going to tell the truth after your next picture
he led what i suppose was an orderly life he ate a balanced diet
not "eternity forever"?  the legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  i'd kill for that part
i was hoping you'd say that
why do you have to bring that up? there's always risk  life's a risk  it's worth it  besides how could something so lovely be a crime?  well i think we've done enough for today  you've been cooped up in there too long  how about you and me go out on the town?  they're expecting us
three? we should hock it buy a cd rack for the bedroom
do you know how important this is? this is big time  i'm going to read it for you doctor
do i really sound like dr seuss?
we can keep it in the bathroom
do i know you?
what? you don't see enough of me at the store?
what anna? what did i do? what's made you so sad?
what kind of man was he? besides  the information you've just given
i didn't leave you
tell me
goodnight sweetheart
i trust you besides i don't know if i'm up for the amish today you can't curse or spit or anything around them
do you think i should stop by on my way back? show you what i got? it's not a problem

'course it's none of my business
let's say today we make it your business

yeah to get the hell off this farm
no this is something spiritual an ambition
the band
not lately
well i've had a hard time getting an actual verification a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there but i checked it out and what happened is he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul so
the hell with this  i'm coming back up
yeah it's the alternator all right
how would you know? you're looking at my tits  jesus carl your job is to keep us on the road
i didn't do anything 
find out what's holding things up i want to get the hell off this farm
sorry
no shit
i'm serious get this i had a careful look at that alternator it's clearly been messed with it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown
you're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm?
not someone  mac
oh
suzie face it the only "axe" he's picked up since we came here is a real one he doesn't give a damn about the band anymore or about you
you need someone who can protect you suzie
he should turn that music down jeremiah's gonna kill him
missed you at church this morning jeremiah
you're not going to arrest me for it are you?
hell no but you missed a damn good sermon "you can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord"
sounds familiar
book of jeremiah
bus broke down
well why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime
was he involved at all  do you think in occultism or satan worship?
i could you sucked
hey fuck you
where's jack? anybody seen jack?
easy gunshot patricide next
yeah marvin's old man gunned him down
that's not patricide patricide is when you gun down your old man
all right "fratricide" minor technical detail
wrong fratricide is when you gun down your brother you're out my turn
fine be that way jim morrison
died in the bathtub if in fact he's really dead next
what?
two hundred bucks?? are you crazy?
 "billyjean" 
i thought you said two hundred
shotgun suicide next?
nah we still got billy bob
i am not i'm telling you it's worth its weight in gold
let me get this straight we're talking about manure?
cowshit? are you sure the aztecs even had cows?
sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it
manure is life
i know it sounds like a lame question but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question but last monthi don't know if you've heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts
it harvests it threshes look at these blades
metaphysical question man
" an axe"
"and a slashslash there "
hi suze
harvest moonshining
old macdonald had some moonshine
he's right nice guitar break
come out come out wherever you are
the sheriff? we don't need the sheriff we need to get the hell out of here
yikes no paul wasn't into that he followed a balanced diet and
depends you got some nerve intruding on a man's grief i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide now: who are you?
you know who i am you invited me
ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years my boy was taken from me far as i'm concerned he's dead now i ain't gonna ask you again  who are you?
joseph macdonald your son
joseph macdonald damn right boy and don't you forget it
broke her heart you never visited but i always said you'd come back
guess it was her time to go you can't argue when the good lord calls you home
pardon?
aunt edith how did she die?
this is his room isn't it?
can i see your back?
yeah i know and was into that whole yale thing
was you ain't afraid of ghosts now are you?
i'll be fine here
maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel
i wouldn't pay jesse no mind at all she's just a crazy old woman hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away  wasn't much right before that neither
she was talking about a "harvest of blood"
"blood?"
i don't think so
that's a good idea maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy jethro
sure what do you want to know
people say he was a murderer
no
that's your grandfather you're talking about  i know what people say heard it all my life
 it's not me
who then jeremiah??  who?
amends?
think boy that night the night of the fire at the barn you were only six years old
i 
not while you're driving
i'm admiring your costume what "movie" are you going as again?
sheena queen of the jungle
i'm not surprised it's got a body count of zero and no one goes around in a stupid mask hacking innocent people to death
had his apartment been burglarized?
you don't like my costume? cool i'll go with plan b which one you like better?
dammit karen  i was just looking for your pulse
 by way of my breasts?
what's wrong?

down boy
who you callin' "boy?"

he started it

yeah sure i'm screwing up the song you're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off
relax he liked what he saw well some of it enough to give us a showcase audition one week from today
yes
which means we've got one week to start acting like a professional band
yeah that sounds good "hang a left at the first cow patty then make a right when you see porky pig"
tell me you checked the bus before we left carl
yeah good idea go milk the cows feed the chickens
no not yet as i said we're not sure but basically no one has seen or heard anything
fuck you fuck all of you i'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters  and drinking moonshine with johnny cash senior and junior
is that right?

if that sumbitch was in the race he'd be in the winner's circle by now
i still think this whole idea is dumb pop
then it must be a helluva idea
because i wanna see this hot shot bandit do something that can't be done besides there's nothing i like better than breaking legends
that's the point dickey
oh
now you just find him son

chickenshit money
congratulations you just became a legend maker
if you cooperate with the da  maybe they'll help you with your situation
but how? where do you place paul that night?
 yeah breaker go head on
 thanks much i'd like to get me a smokey report?
 road looks clean as a hound's tooth
 okey doke last one to the roadeo is a homo
 yeah banana peel go head on
 did ya hear they nailed the bandit?
 yeah i heard but they won't hold him for long anyway he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money
and everybody all the time yeah it's a chore
that's correct
but with these down doesn't that pose a major security concern if as you say you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
according to his date book and this was verified by his secretary he had dinner withmarcus halberstam
well we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras so
 so you shut them off?
what kind of personnel?
you have a butler working that floor?
so there are no guests staying on that floor?
no no no we've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now the security team is only present to preserve floor integrity due to the roof access
is your security team armed?
of course yes
and who has access to that floor?
only the mention made in that phone call there's no swedish hitman of any renown much less one with a million dollar day rate
and?
maybe he's that good never been caught no criminal record
maybe
and a very bad gamble
well this is as good a place for it as any i guess
no rest for the wicked  why were we never shown these files? we're sitting on sparazza for what? six months now and we're just seeing this?  did you know that he's has had thirty six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  elective plastic surgery every single one 
welcome to the new bureau nobody shares information anymore it's become synonymous with job security
based on what we had i thought sparazza was a midlevel player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic running the show out west
heller was buried in agency lore anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed hoover blackballed their memory look at ness
yeah but the untouchables took down capone heller got shot and killed the bad guys beat him worse sparazza walked
no and i want to be in that room a half second after mecklen calls to say the deal's done we've got a sheriff's task force on standby
i've questioned him
what about the hotel staff obstructing us israel's obviously paid off the management
tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level  trust me we won't any problems with the hotel staff you show 'em your id with the letters "fbi" in all caps and it's instant compliance i've seen in happen a hundred times
all of 'em his entire entourage i think we should move
did the justice lawyers sign off?
that's happening in about ten minutes israel's at optimum risk of flight right now so we can't wait
have them mobilized i'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured we need to keep israel sequestered in that penthouse
get a coroner's estimate too   miss i've been transferred and i was disconnected no one is answering and i need someone from security to pick up that line it's urgent
yeah have you been able to get through to the nomad's security?
no  i'm going over there you take the car from there get out to the lake
mortal
marcus?
no
yeah
 agent carruthers do you know where is he now?
he uh  he asked about  i'm  he wanted to know whic what floor security was on then i saw him get on the elevator with the other agent
wait a minute what other agent?  what other agent?
yeah uh  it was spanishsomethin' garcia or diego uh 
 run both those names through the dc database call san francisco see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for 
 he was wearing one of our jackets
the other agent he said he was here to do an inspection and later when he got on the elevator with the other guy carruthers i saw him wearing one of our security jackets
uh yeah
yes and he denies it though at first he couldn't be sure
you're sure?
yeah he had the badge and everything it said "fbi" on it
and when you saw him later he was wearing one of your security jackets 
yeah
and that didn't seem odd to you?
ww uh
three men were ambushed and shot two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake the other has severe hypothermia possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end if he even lives that long
you shot me and murdered my friends
i did we  yeah i know
and threw us into the lake
but marcus denied it?
pretty much yep
mmmhmm
but there were more of you?
yeah m'brothers they didn't make it
two of 'em?
thass' right  i got other brother's though so it ain't so bad
you were here huntin' a man named israel weren't you? your name is tremor
shoot i appreciate that man
if i needed your id and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law i woulda killed you to get 'em too
you woulda?
yes
oh hell yeah we's just in the wrong place at the wrong time so don't feel so bad dude
damn alright then
i don't mind now anyway you know up here in heaven it's beautiful way better than fuckin' hawaii or any place like that
i'm glad i'm here i love it i'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with jesus and them
i got it made in the shade amigo hey i'll see you up here some day don't worry
you think so?
yeah why
about what?
about cocaine and the amount you're doing
i'm not doing cocaine
well does marcus have an alibi?
buddy i'm not an ethics professor i'm a physician be honest or be dead within a day s'your choice
that's not possible i told you
there are certain meds certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done but i'd have to administer them myself
won't work we're just gonna have to chance it man i'm sorry
no sorry comes later when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection sorry 
 fine fuck i got it lake tahoe nevada i'll have hugo book your flight you can be here in a couple hours he'll meet you at the airport
i sent hugo he should be there
the teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate night of the polling big blacktie todo downtown and the tremor brothers crash the party literally
jack if the rumors hold and israel is really the great white whale of snitches then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that so what real incentive is there to track him on something as smalltime as a skip trace when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom
shit if you're on a crazy jag why stop there why not take fort knox with a fucking slingshot or go into hell after hitler i like your chances a lot more
yes
that's already happened hoss it's naive to think otherwise
then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl reed just gave us fifty grand
 jack what am i doing? i'm standing here aren't i?  shouldn't that be enough? that i made the trip?
your attitude sucks
i been accused of worse  what do we got?
then what 
i got his machine
i said i got his machine
no what did you say on the machine?
i left him a message
what's normal?
i will if they don't send me back
i checked it out it's clean
i know you left him a message what did you say
okay
then why are you still looking at me like i'm asking for the square root of something what did you say?
look at that we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all now do you know anything about that?
look at the collar on that coat
cinnamon roll? no good guess though no hugo that looks like jizz  and i'm no forensic expert mind you but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelvethousand dollar calf's skin jacket the twist? it's my twelve thousand dollar calf's skin jacket  so y'got semen human ejaculate    that's been allowed to soak in for what six seven hours now? work it's way into the fabricfuck'n fibers  and while you may never see it in a tide commercial i think it still safely qualifies as a "tough deep down stain"
to what? incinerate? 'cuz i'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory some shit suffice it to say just don't wash out  now the money question to whom does that stain belong?
i was kinda hoping yeah
do you want me to say i'm sorry?
only if you really truly mean it
oh kimball now where were you? 
are you a fucking colossal idiot?
i am yeah
without peer?
i  uh yeah i guess yeah
that's right right now
we're hot and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction"
alright bag it i'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole this is a junior suite in vegas call mecklen right now he should have his cell on i need an update  get the russian up here have him clean this place floor to ceiling and get us packed  and send out for some new skeeze the sun's up these ones are starting to stink
see this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest and if i'm asking you what you said to mecklen assume the shit is rhetorical so assume i already know
that's mecklen the deal's closing i can pick that phone up and i can work this out  you'll walk with me
get in here goddammit
where was marcus?
i dunno what to say to you sweetheart it is what it is
bullshit it is i said about as loud as i could say it "no jail time for my guys"
 and you're gonna feel altogether fucked by me if you don't handle this i'm the one does the face plant this falls apart not you
i don't have to do shit which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until i get what i want  alright fuck it if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hardons about it  make it hugo him i don't mind he needs that regimented thing that prison provides 
 buddy it's bigger than that they want 'em all ivy beanie 
 this isn't a swap meet morrey they're getting sparazza and the west coast syndicate giftwrapped now if that's not good enough 
they what? what? no no why?
the deputy director this prick locke he smashed the whole thing we're done they won't tell me why
i thought heller was a double op?
sparazza was the one who introduced israel to the life gave him his first big break brought him through the ranks
he wasn't with paul owen
his testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the la cosa nostra is this country that alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with witness protection
 your intel corroborates what we already know sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny it seems he wants one last thing the heart of his sworn enemy a recently opened cash rich escrow account has been traced back to sparazza this and the mention of this mysterious swede makes the million dollar contract on israel very real
you think it's possible he could be involved in the israel hit?
possibly acosta is pure mercenary and a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies but forget about sparazza's money for a moment and remember there's no shortage of those who want israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that
israel's legal representation the firm of culpepper brody and reed which is currently the subject of a joint sec and treasury department probe were left holding the bag after he skipped bail over three quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day rupert reed one of the firm's partners has learned of israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of jack dupree to pick him up and return him to las vegas that can't happen  we have a gulf stream standing by at reagan international to transport you two to lake tahoe  it's very simple gentlemen valacchi fratiano gravano  no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of the la cosa nostra than buddy israel
this is him? the hitman hired to kill israel? he's a doctor?
difficult to explain everything now  and much larger issues loom  i'm sorry about carruthers damndest thing to have to die for
we have to transport mr israel to las vegas time is of the essence the gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at tahoe international i'm sorry i'm restricted from disclosing anymore information return to washington you'll be debriefed in the coming days
what are you doing here?
my debrief 
so who was he with?
 will be handled back in 
 no we need to handle it now
 you can and you will
you're finished
and you just figured that out?  the swede isn't a hitman is he? he's a surgeon sparazza didn't want israel's heart for a trophy he wanted it for a transplant why?
 brought against sparazza by israel's mother laverne who was nineteen at the time they had a brief affair which israel was the by product of
he does now
so all of our intel was bogus to begin with
yes the actual contract went to lazlo soot the man that plunged to his death from the penthouse yesterday he was to neutralize israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself onsite with the assistance of dr gregory gill israel's personal physician who was also on the sparazza payroll
information was arriving all day yesterday when we finally figured out who sparazza actually was we 
personally i think the guy went a little nutso split town for a while maybe he did go to london sightseeing drinking whatever anyway i'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later  i mean to think that one of his friends killed him for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous isn't that right patrick?
almost  what do you mean "who sparazza actually was"
it wasn't elective it was undertaken to save his life and it wasn't cosmetic it was reconstructive look at the date of the first procedure
yeah fiftythree
the same year that sparazza murdered agent freeman heller
primo sparazza was heller's alias he went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates he may have ripped the organization wide open preappalachia but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue swapped allegiancesso they gave the order to terminate his cover
so you made another deal?
i wouldn't go that far
but you did and have and now people are dead  did sparazza become more valuable than israel and did you make another deal?
no we're trying to save heller
so you knew all this and yet y
it's cold out too isn't it?
 we needed cohesion to move forward not conjecture
while carruthers and a dozen others lie dying you debate semantics the bureau's betrayed us  the way they betrayed him
i don't see it like that at all
no it's not  what it lacks is an end
yeah sid?
you got clicks anything?
nah nuthin' on my end 
 okay hang on i gotta move 
i'm here
 he's doing it then huh 
i'm so hungry
 yeah now lemme finish i was eavesdroppin' so give me sec lay this thing out since the information might be a little loose 
 okay g'head 
so what i heard downstairs there is that they got a guy some swede real badass supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over now he ain't coming cheap  so i'm thinkin' we jump do this in the next day or so get to israel before the swede can we got chits y'see? we're in a power position grab him ransom him back pick up that nut we're that much closer to having our own thing
fuckin' a first survive yes?
y'gotta y'gotta but d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick assuming we get to'm
yeah y'ain't heard the punchline yet and before i get to it one more thing i heard little curious should probably bring it up primo wants israel's heart the actual thing the organ
 who can say he's off his onion y'know he's old school sicilian this is how they hate
wow
hey we nab israel they pay t'get'm back i'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self no extra charge my thing is we crew up let's not fuck around someone's cousin some zip off the boat from naples let's get pros people who know how to behave
yeah there's a pair'a broads i'm thinking might be good for this
why don't you get a job? if you're so hungry why don't you get a job?
chances are they're gonna get into some shit too hafta put people down
that's not a problem are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
yeah i can front this
well just so i got a quote in my head what's the rate for the swede?
that's the punchline y'ready?
shoot
a million flat
no shit
none whatsoever
yeah sid?
i lost my job
right you got clicks anything?
nah nuthin' on my end 
good this thing's on track looks like it's gonna get done
fuckin' thrilled t'hear it so the scout the sitdown y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
cold blood sid dead eyes y'know?
okay  yeah i can i respect that
how are we on time?
well uh  damn alright so he's headed in does that  where does that leave us?
okay well y'know then we just gotta get israel

leave the light off
what do you want?
i'm hungry
you're being tricked  sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors  he's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos and he's going to create a negative neutrino field  twenty four hours a day until they're back on earth
can it work?
it can  ordinary matter like ours? not affected  everything else disintegrates
i can trust rheya
you'll end up like me
you're not gibarian
no?  who am i then?
a puppet
and you're not?  maybe you're my puppet  but like all puppets you think you're actually human  it's the puppet's dream  wondering if they're human
all right
listen do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
didn't you talk to snow?
i want to hear your version
who here could possibly care what you want?  at best you're employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction  they have no idea what's going on up here they've never even been in space and i'm supposed to listen to you?
i am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation  now: what happened to him?
the same thing that could happen to any of us
where's his body?
in the lab  with her probably
her?  who are you talking about?
just so you know: i'm not going back until i understand what it is  i am going to figure out what it is make it stop and then i will go home
listen 
what am i gonna do?
we're done  oh i should tell you i don't trust snow  there's something wrong with him
she reappeared exactly as she had before?
yes
that's fantastic
why did you agree to come here?
not her  it
kelvin she begged me  i had a short range version of the destabilizer prototype a miniature with a range of a few meters  she walked into it and disappeared  she was gone
no she won't
why would you let her to do that?
it's not human kelvin  whatever it is it's not human and i am threatened by that  evolutionof thespeciesatstake threatened and i want to win  i want humans to win  so i am killing it before it kills me
listen what's your name?
you fucking bastard
whose side are you on?
how quickly?
if it continues it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it
yes
he's dead
how?
what?
i love chocolate  i realized just yesterday how much i love it  i thought maybe if they let you bring personal effects you might have snuck some through because well i've been thinking about it
where's sartorius?
divorced
al
in his lab  he won't let you in
he'll let me in
kelvin if you see anything unusual
why who did you see?
gibarian warned me  he left me a message
who was it?
she was real  where did she come from?
oh that's a relief
how much sleep?
how long can you go without sleep?
speak up come on
that depends
well when you do go to sleep: barricade your door
shut up
i told you try to stay calm  you're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch
what was it?
and professionally?
i'm not sure  it started with gibarian  he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door  he covered the video lens obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown  i don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there  by this time we were getting visitors too  he was desperately trying to figure it out  day and night  who was she?
my wife
dead?
rheya
al
it started about three months ago right after the government sold the expedition  we were ready to go home
will she come back?
probably
i wish you'd told me
told you what?
to who?
what are you going to report back to earth?
i don't know
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project we are in little danger of being left alone for long  you'll need to do something otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed
get a goddamn job al you've got a negative attitude that's what's stopping you you've got to get your act together i'll help you
that's ludicrous  this is contact we have found god  the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth  so how will we describe it if we choose to describe it at all?
what is it?
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour?
why?
just a little strategy session  but in person this time
i'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances
when you cut yourself pounding the door did it hurt?
 we are not sure of that  we are not sure we aren't all hallucinating
if god is beyond our comprehension and she    is here for reasons that can't be understood isn't god here?
not necessarily
you re so kind mister you're kind you're a kind man i can tell
stop equivocating  unbelievable how you equivocate  you the atheist you're more dogmatic than any holy person i've ever seen  this is happening kelvin  wake up
consciousness is enough that's all i've saying  consciousness should be enough for anybody
who are you trying to convince?
no
of course when we return we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth  we'll chalk it up to isolation collective derangement
i've never heard you express any desire to leave before now  why now?
well i think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here right?  certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it
but why is it doing what it's doing? given it's resources it could have done anything  presented me with your double and you with mine
perhaps it did
human beings can die
shhhhit's okay
but they are human  they certainly become human with incredible speed first they're like they were in our memory but then they fill in on their own  dna doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain it's not dense enough  they build up with experience
that's right  and we all have to sleep eventually
she drank liquid oxygen
get out 
oh this one you love?  what about the first one the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  you didn't love her?
she knows everything?  does she know she came once before and you put her in 
no
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan
what plan?
just get him to stop
pleasei don know what to do i'm so cold
what do you want to do leave the station with her?
yes
kelvin she'll disintegrate  you don't believe me?  let's radio that shuttle pod you launched  better yet let's go get it  i've charted it's trajectory only take a few hours
her oxygen would have run out
maybe she doesn't need any  should we check?
into what?
you'll see her die that's all they're mortal despite what she told you  she will die  then what will you do?
i love her
you do you don't  she's willing to give her life you're willing to give yours it's touching and magnificent anything you want but  this isn't the place for it  don't you see?  no you don't
i won't be making the trip
do you know how bad you smell? the stench my god
oh right away  that's why you never saw me with anyone  you should've noticed that  i miss him though i think i made a mistake
jesus
but i can't leave with you  i won't make it
maybe you can
yes
i'll go with you
i'll just be a minute
why?
i don't know  i can't be alone
i'll be right back
i can'ti can't find a shelter
to calm your anxiety
to calm my anxiety
yes
i want you inside me right now
book?
poem  dylan thomas  i thought of it when i saw you on the train
my thomas is a little rusty
you didn't look very happy
i wasn't
and tonight?
you reek you reek ofshit do you know that?  goddammit allook at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot ali'm sorry
better
stop it
you behave as though you want to fuck her
rheya  not here
and i just want to know if i'm crazy or not  if what i think is happening is actually happening  or am i one of those people those women who are blind to what's going on?  who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
let's go home
you go home
i am  please come with me  i don't want to do this here
you talk like an actor
i know i know  but still somehow i don't feel better
do you live alone?  i've been in these clothes sincethe killings  could we stop at your place? i could take a showerbefore i go into custody?
i've been great and you?
all right  how about i feel better when you take them?
what do you mean?
do you remember beethoven?  the beatles?  movies books restaurants friends?
yes  but not until you mentioned them  as soon as you said those things i remembered them  and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember  it's like filling up
not exactly  it exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe an infinite number of them in fact it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or spacetime  it was completely counterintuitive  we had to unlearn everything
is it intelligent?
intelligent beyond our comprehension
then it's god right?
it's something
you still don't believe in god?
it'sit'sall right
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man  even the limits we put on it are human limits  it can do this it can do that  it designs it creates
even a god that wasn't active that just created something and stood back and watched?
you're talking about a man in a white beard again  you're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human  human beings look for causes and patterns  how could we know what solaris is up to if anything?
as i said it is beyond our comprehension
as i said then it's god right?
you were trying to break down the door  do you know why?
when i saw you were gone i got scared
i been thinking about how much i hate you
how old were you?
seven eight  so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what i'm doing and i start trying to explain to her about this state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face
really? that's interesting  not great?
what kind of look?
i know  i know  we don't have to talk about that
i did too
you don't know?
i don't know  i couldn't understand why you didn't tell me
it's genetics  you know this  you know where it comes from  there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires
i think so
good  because i want you to know i really like fucking you
how could she not be real?  i can smell her taste her  she does exactly what she did it's not possible
you know i've decided: i'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big strong husband you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day
oh well you know
i know  i'm putting that in my next report
snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it to prove its existence to the planet earth  this is hilarious: he thinks it's god but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home
well  he doesn't think it's god but for different reasons than me he's thinking: if i can figure out how to make it stop than i am smarter than it is and therefore it cannot be god
he has a point
he does have a point  that's just not the way i'd like to see it proven
you feel sorry for solaris or for me?
it's a violent response to something we haven't figured out  don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: he is ruthless  unblinking in his prejudice
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me
yes  yes
i'm glad
and how's cecilia? she's a great girl
you don't love me
stop
that i am not rheya  that rheya died  killed herself  i'm different
sartorius
when?  when i'm asleep?
i'm just trying to understand what's going on
yes  especially toward the end
why did she do it?
you she said i didn't love her
was she right?
oh yes i'm very lucky
no  i love you
i love you too
i don't think do  it's not sleep; it's something else  it's all around me
those are dreams
don't debate him; he'll say anything
i'm just as human as you  i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do
rheya
that's what you were saying  i heard what you were saying
for a reason that neither of us understand you are forced to stay near me  that's all i know right now
neither can i  not any of it there's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before it's a clean break in the fabric of the universe; a gap  there is nothing to do but experience it momentto moment and not let it destroy us
yeah well you're late
but that's what happened before
not this time
do you?
if you're here
gibarian  he was here
you said he was dead
he is  but he was here
it's all right
please don't lie  i told you before i don't know how i came to be here whatever you think you can't say to me i need to hear you say it
i love you
hey i'm a child of divorce give me a break  hmmm i see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello
don't  i'm the one at risk here if we're playing out what happened before i won't survive
how can i tell?  you've seen both of me  i only know what you're like here  you're all i know  there is no "you" from before
i don't think it knows it's torturing us  it's just watching
rheya 
don't call me that
i'm disgusting
no
you're lying  i'm not human
rheya i am not going back  i'm staying here with you
then you'll die
we should've gone to dorsia i could've gotten us a table
i want every second i can get with you
you should have told me
it wouldn't have made any difference
thank you
chris i had to  i had to  i didn't think you'd react like this
neither did i
you never said you wanted one
i never said i didn't
chris 
i can't stay here
nobody goes there anymore
chris please  chris i'm serious i won't make it
then you won't make it
i want you here
you're lying
you exist here  i keep telling you
that's impossible  i'm not rheya
who are you then?
i i am rheya  but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago
yes you are 
did you hear what gibarian said? i'm not a human being  i'm an instrument  i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what  even if i remain passive  that's when i drank the  i was going mad  it felt like there was no body underneath my skin there was something else  an illusion  but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood  is it like yours?
somewhere else?
i could tell you that halberstam but then i'd have to kill you
yes  i told you  it was exactly like mine
but then i would be dead now
i want to stop taking those pills
i wish you wouldn't
they do something to me  it's hard to think straight
i think they help
i have consciousness but i am not mortal  don't you see why i'm going crazy?
you have to remember that i love you that's all that matters 
i can't 
it put you here  i'll admit it it acted like a god and put you here put you into my consciousness  i was asleep and it put you into my dream  i saw your mouth  and there you were  whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me it doesn't matter  the decision we make now is all that matters  stay with me
cecelia is wellyou know 
am i really her?
i don't know anymore  all i see is you
a sleeping pill  do you want yours?
i don't know  something  anything
please  don't
when?
last night  you were talking to someone in the corridor
you must have been dreaming
shhhh  just stay with me  stay with me  everything is forgiven everything
why do you say that?
evelyn great ass goes out with that loser patrick bateman what a dork
he won't
we want to talk freely
it's an experiment
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the original the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness
followed by nonhuman manifestations
are the actions of solaris premeditated?
gibarian was helpless  it's very simple: man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris and the ship that brought us here
i'm not snow
fuck me  i knew it
you go ahead  of what i remember about earth it's all one thing now  everything's a blur  i like distinctions
another martini paul?
hello win
they've got two monsters now  both boys
and so what's with steinhart?  is it serious?
you didn't like him?

it's called "solid" nice to find someone you can count on win
you still writing the occasional magazine article?
occasionally
then c'mon  follow me  the art's in the basement you're going to get a privileged peek
it's okay i've never been a detective before either
twohundredandfifty very reasonable let's leave a big tip shall we? my place hr a nightcap?
hard to find doors in this place
i'm sorry  i'm not sure how this works  i have to go out is that all right?
uh
i have to pick something up before bergdorf's closes then stop at a reception just a few blocks away
i think maybe that isn't such a great idea
lieutenant garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger is that true?
right  that's true
can we go then?
i'm supposed to call in
there's a phone in the car
no man i'm gonna bail
oh yes i don't have it with me  it's at home
he thinks you're being a little careless  he made the point several times

i'll come with you
i think i can probably do that on my own
i came on at 8:00
yeah
i'm sorry about what happened
listen that was my fault
i shouldn't have listened to you i should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did
they're okay bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste but then sports came out in 1983 i think they really came into their own commercially and artistically
if i had known i was going to have company he was right next to me  i think he heard me peeing  i hate that i am glad he's in jail
sooner the better
he said he'd kill me
big talk desperate guy
right  how could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key?
hmm
you wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in india do you?
urdu and hindi
yeah what a woman
nope never finished one yet  i hate these things
yes owen?
you were reading my renoir
how did you know?

no kidding
could be i guess
want to go out for a drink?  i mean we're both sitting here and joey venza's in jail
yeah i like that  where you go i follow
absolutely  look at this
why are there copies of the style section all over the place? do you have a dog? a chow or something?

hey  this is my business  do i tell you your business
okay  let's just see if a mugger gets me
so it was "love"

this is me mike  there's nothing else
you don't wash your clothes at the boulevard laundromat you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school what is this?  a fuckin' joke?
you'll look like you consciously worked for the look
okay then let's make it easy  it was a mistake  don't make me feel guilty now that it's over let's forget about it
not exactly
what do you want to do?
i don't know
oh i do want to know  i tried to reach you at the precinct
i've moved into scotty's good news about tj though  looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through
oh god that's great
are you okay?
oh i'm fine  they've replaced you with quite an entourage  it's a regular "marching band"  you should see me on the street you'd think i was the first lady 
oh that thing in queens
good point excuse me gentlemen
i'm going away after that the next morning
pretty far  i'm told not to say anything about it on the phone in case it's tapped they think it's best safer if i go away at least till venza's found
i don't know  garber's left orders here not to let you in the building
tomorrow night  can you come?
i don't know  it wouldn't be very smart
listen you're right  don't do it i'll just send you an address okay?
no really it's okay i've gotta go i'm expecting some calls  i'll be fine really
i'll think about wednesday

yeah
it's venza  he wants you  you for ellie and tommy
mike?
yeah  it's all over
so
i don't know
you don't have to now
i think it's probably still a good idea

you have a weakness for lady cops
some guys are just born cool i guess
i do
you take care
it was something my father always liked me to do
you're planning to speak?

well of course we'd be honored
just putting in an appearance then
 i don't want to talk about it
claire

they still have to give 'em refreshments laced with mindaltering drugs
win made his choices claire  we all do 
and i'm making mine
what am i supposed to do?  i saw one of my oldest friends get killed and i saw who did it  i can't just  "let it go away"
claire

oh some shit
what shit honey?
you don't want to hear about it
i don't know that ellie  he might get out  garber's not bein' straight with the witness she could be in deep shit if she identifies him and it's my job to convince her she won't be
she's got to identify him
why?
because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals  i can't believe you're talking this way mister detective  i think she's got a lot of guts
you know what i mean
i think  she's crazy
i'd identify him
i might stop you
no  no  i'm sorry  ninetyseven five right?
where'd you get the tie?
it's not your taste
what did she say the down payment was?
she didn't like the other one so she picked this one
she took you shopping for a tie?
i had to follow her to a store
you know what he's like he just wants to work on stuff that's cool
what's wrong with your paisley tie?
ellie it was a formal party
excuse me  you went to a party with her?
i'm her bodyguard goddamnit
i know you're her bodyguard  did she buy it or did you?
she bought it
why?
i don't know why she bought me a tie  she's a generous person  and she's a nice person  and i could be settin' her up to be killed you want the fuckin' tie?
few minutes  want to catch the news
should i wait up?  we've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow
you don't wanna move do you?
i'll be right up
goddamn venza assaulted a taxi driver in the bronx thirteen months ago  it's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law
take it easy  i set her up  i saw it coming
it's not your fault  mike please get off the case
it is my fault  i'm responsible for her
did you hear what i said?
did you hear what i said?
i want you and tommy to stay with my mother
d'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
what was that?
i can paint anywhere
you heard me
jesus mike somebody's been feeding you a line of crap
what're you talking about 
i'm talking about i've been talking this way for sixteen years and now out of the blue it's vulgar
i'm sorry
i'm not saying it's your fault
i watched tv
what did you watch?
i don't remember michael go to sleep  you don't have to make conversation with me
well  this'll be over soon venza's such a nut job we're bound to pick him up soon
anything? that's not even credible if he wants to go up there? to check it out? i think you should encourage him  it's his life but everybody's treating him like this  valuable object you're hurting your own case
i'd like you to switch to the day shift mike  to be home for dinner helen insists that tj be home for dinner that's why he's on the morning shift
well tj's seniority and all  i'll talk to garber about it
i already did  i mean i talked to his wife and she talked to him
you talked to his wife?
what's the difference?
get away from me get away  she means that much to you you stay with her  but you come back you come back for me  not for tommy not for your mother or your fucking job but for me
el?  i'm sorry  i do love you  and you are a lady  i have so much respect
what about tommy?
he'll live through it  they all live through it  what a world huh?
no
c'mon how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of time three of four times
i'm all right
me neither
i just sat and listened
safe and secure is how we want her until she id's venza
when i want your advise keegan i'll make an appointment
discourage it  but stay with her if you can't  call it in first so we can have a car on tail  she's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine okay let's check it out
you apprehended him after he gave himself up 
it wasn't a bad bust  he gave himself up because he knew i was gonna nab him
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail
even joey venza?
then you've gotta ask him about that
he's got a good lawyer and he made a smart move  we've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in
what about when she identifies him?
if she identifies him  where the fuck were you anyway cowboy  venza was meat  he walked right past you and now we're the ones playing catchup  you better hope she identifies him
i heard
it should've been me
call me next week  we'll talk about it
call a cruiser
koontz  i need you guys
we'll call swat  we'll get the locals  throw it
no i need'm now
if he's really a bully he won't cop to it anyway
i can't do it you know that he's not gonna allow it anyway mike  no way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive who can finger him
right behind you tj
bad fuckin' news  even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands  but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried  it'd cap it for garber if he could bring him in
do it or look for another profession  that's a choice i guess
you in this with me?
yeah  seniority gets the day shift
be happy  he's good at this
it was my fault tj  fuck
i just gotta talk to her tj
ever shot anyone?
yes i considered it
bully? are we talking about gary boyd? or your dad
yes
does it make you hard?
 hard?
erect  you know a "boner?"  i'd heard that it gives you a boner to shoot a man
no sir
i asked for the man in charge
that would be lieutenant garber and he's very busy upstairs
don't tell me he's "busy"  i asked for an ambulance for this woman and
is she injured?
she's not a suspect sir she's a witness  could i ask you to step outside please
but he's not quite the same guy anymore don't get your hopes too high?
no i will not step outside
sir i am just trying to do my job it's standard procedure to question the witness alone  help me out here could you please leave
i don't really see what that has to do with
i'm relieved at 4:00 am
that's right you're gonna do what i say  joey  i want to help you out of this
you should'a brought the girl
i brought the girl  she's outside
i'll prove it
i'll bring her in  you let them go and i'll bring her in
why should she come in?
i think that's great milo i do
she trusts me  she'll do what i say
bullshit  prove it
koontz  let her come in  claire it's pitch dark in here  you're gonna have trouble seeing anything so just come in and straight down a long hall  then stand at the door so we can see you we want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door
i get my hostage first  no one's turned loose until i say so
let my kid go
i'm not lettin' no one go

i'll take his place all right?  put the gun to my head

what would it mean anyway? if he didn't write it?
well
just about  you see i also have this amazing strength
just about  see i also have this amazing strength
when peter was little he loved to hide  in closets under the sink he needed a secret place  but when i'd look for him he'd laugh he wanted to be found
i don't think he wants me to find him
he knew
some things you should say anyway
even if they're not clever
even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written
what if you get hurt?
that's what i'm asking myself does he have some genius stowed away? why not let him write skywire  'not saying it makes sense
what if the world ends tomorrow?
how very dull peter parker
it's too early to be clever
huh?
fill in the blank: "i blank elizabeth allan"
i uh
uh is a good start
i lovloathe elizabeth allan abhor detest despise
oh  well i hate you and everyone who looks like you
i hate people with alliterative names
i know i know
i hate
i hate your relatives i hate your coffee i hate your shoes
thank god
poor harry  always desperate for attention  what about the bunny?
back to the lab  harry'll probably lose his scholarship
maybe  i could have stopped it though
since you're feeling guilty why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
yeah  really gets to you if you let it
you want to give them something but they'll just buy more ripple and they smell so bad
what?
if you can't deal with him on that basis you better get a new counselor
but you like that in a man?
you should write that one down
"flash" liz  you're going out with something that calls itself "flash"
some prep school thing
does it have a human name?
eugene  admit it peter you'd do anything for a nickname like "flash"
i'd never admit that
hurry up flash
i've gotta study
oh maybe i should too
isn't that  extreme?
hi adele
i'm sure you kept warm
what's your problem?
i've got no problems
this from a girl who still plays with dolls
that wasn't clever  that was just nasty
sort of  i'm returning the that outfit that you hated so much maybe i can get my money back
oh don't do it on my account
no it wasn't only you it  it just wasn't my style  hey look let's go to lunch  someplace nice for a change
this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
no
what's extreme is what that er doctor said when he pumped your stomach eat another sesame seed and that's it
that was then  i'm better since the lobotomy
do you mind if i come too?
i think i'd like that
you're not trained for that  none of us are i mean sometimes i  okay let's say you had gone back what then?  are you bulletproof?
well no
so?  the next day i'd read "peter parker murdered" and i'd feel
you'd feel what?
listen  you think you're responsible for everything that happens  don't flagellate yourself  and don't flatter yourself either  you're not the center of the universe you're just peter
am i?  i'm not so sure  i used to be sure of a lot of things  oh different things from week to week but now i'm not sure of anything anymore
i know what you mean  i
you're right it's  a working relationship don't know what i was expecting
unhhuh  excuse me  i've gotta go
just shut up and close your eyes this'll hurt
oh god i forgot to
ssh  i always thought she was a strong person  she is but not for the reasons i thought
strong
i'm here
hello  so very boring  peter parker how do you feel about me this morning?
i i like you  a lot
hm  well i like you too  i like your aunt  i like your shoelaces i like
why?
teddy was killed last night
nah
so you've found thorkel?
but you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms
waldos
right we have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men with the waldos
yeah that's fascinating but i'm just a fat dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer
there's an infinitely greater danger if  listen  the only thing octavius cares about is repeating his experiment  to do that he needs a radioactive catalyst sl 270
and he'll need a cyclotron  he can't use ours he's already destroyed it  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard  new haven long island two in cambridge
you sure about all this?
i know him
what're you  what?
it's a lot of ground to cover we'll try  funny coincidence huh?
no such thing as coincidence  "god does not play dice with the universe"
einstein right?  we'll see ya
peter my condolences
any sign of our friend?
nope  maybe he skipped to rio feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent  are you absolutely positive that one at esu is kaput?
that's the understatement of the year
your records are older than you are  have you never heard of new wave?
oh peter a zit
but i didn't feel like getting to know your roaches
it was a hate crime
i'll introduce you
ick  and those foul chemicals in the pots
i'm a photographer remember?
anyway i've decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills
yes  do you have a date?
no
it'll shut itself off
tofu  ben i wish you wouldn't
you were adorable  the least you could do is use a glass
funny thing happened after my physics class today harry osborn
i don't know what i'm saying maybe  maybe they hired those guys
use a fork
see?  you big dullard
it's fine  tell me what
oh ben gets through everything
aunt may what happened?
i was napping on the couch  there was a voice and a shot  i woke up ben was looking at me
how is he?
he'll be fine they won't tell me anything but i'm sure he'll be fine
hi  i've got sort of a hypothetical question  do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
is this some sort of zen thing?
i can't see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that
i mean i suddenly have immense physical power and the ability to crawl up walls
do ya? lemme give you the number for bellevue  that's 5615151
yeah a psychiatric hospital listen i'm serious
power down  i need to talk to you
proof  proof of a unified field not just theory and equations experimental proof
let's talk in the hall
i've had an extremely bad day octavius  a sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures
i couldn't care less  what i've done is
this is the unified field  all the forces of the universe tied together perfectly
i don't care  cretin
i don't know i just know it was teddy's code all these ideas flying in from everywhere you know how he says "any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" it's like they know what every kid's doing
no
rosomoff i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents
perhaps but every now and then someone pays attention  you did
i heard about thorkel's order
i left a paper in my desk
you're wrong  just for a moment i heard saw felt i became creation
truth pure eternal  beyond the boundaries of mere mortality
i'll repeat the experiment  i will hold the truth that's the only thing that matters
no it isn't
oh roz  my mind is so far beyond yours now  i could beat you at chess now
they hack into people's programs?
truth  truth alone exists truth must be released
you have no right  this is cosmic suicide
hi professor  what's up?
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because uh
your dog ate it
really professor i
caused by doc ock's experiment?
how much do you know about it?
not a lot  i saw inside of the science center  what exactly happened?
only octavius knows for sure  and last time i spoke to him he was on the planet whizbang
nobody does work like this online it's in your pc or in a mainframe selfcontained they'd have to be like watching people physically  oh jesus
no thank you  i'm sure you've got your own problems
luck  the right place at the right time
really  i'd like to speak with him
i don't think i'll be running into him
you never know  go get some sleep
i'll try thanks
oh yeah  thanks
if you really apply yourself you'll get an a next time
oh i don't know thanks mr reiss but
i was hoping you'd call babe look you got representation?
unsolved mystery  she used to be really popular when she started high school then it was just like she got sick of it or something
bogey lowenstein's party is normal but you're too busy listening to bitches who need prozac to know that
what about back home?
you're scaring me i think we should just go
like it?
nah  the big mask was better
yup  oh here's your check minus my commission  solid solid novelty act
what?
i asked if you felt like a drink
no  no i my aunt and uncle something's wrong    i need to make a phone call
okay kid call me tomorrow
i just gave yeah sure
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
right  let's go
go where? you can't get away from people like this
yeah just a lung full of new jersey  lucky you showed up when you did
logic  lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270  i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a
imagine how i feel
he'll try to finish his experiment
and blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  bit egotistical isn't it?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius in  his universe there's only one mind his own it must be very lonely
forgive me if i don't feel too sympathetic right now
bonkers
loonytunes  and yet
just drop me off here
"like this?" it's gary you're talking about
no but i've got this secret identity to worry about i'll swing the rest of the way
i see  well octavius won't get much further they'll catch him and put him away  sad  he might very well have the truth
phooey on that
i'm not so happy myself
sure in the war  pull those cables
no no  not there
i wouldn't talk about things like that
they never caught on
they may that's why i would keep my mouth shut
plenty
you think i don't know that?
you must have shot off your mouth all the way from frankfurt to here
we did not
is you all good nazis?
jawohl
is you all little adolfs?
jawohl
then we shall all zalute feldwebel von und zu schulz about face
i don't have to think we didn't tell anything to anybody not a word not until we hit this barrack
any news on dunbar?
he's still in the kommandant's office that's all i know
milo why would he 
there was that ammunition train in the depot at frankfurt see? so dunbar gets himself in the men's room and fixes a time bomb see? then he waits until the train starts moving out see? and one of the cars got the door open with some straw on the floor see? so he throws it see and three minutes later  voom see?
throws what? how could he have a time bomb?
just pulled the old match gag see
what's the match gag?
take some matches see?  and a cigarette see?  tuck the cigarette in like this see?  now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse see?
don't worry he'll be all right
i had to be the ham i had to shoot off my mouth
forget it he'll be back here they've got no proof
looks good outside
static
how should i know? "solving a problem" i guess or needing to control everything i don't know  i've gotta get in there
roger
okay move on
coming up
get going on the trap door
that'll do
we'll get some more
i don't know anymore
in this barracks?
why not? just one of the boys sharing our bunks eating our chow right in amongst the ones that beat me up except that he beat hardest
who is it?
even if all this were true there're 20 other buildings all of them filled with computers and 
that's not the point cookie the point is what do you do with him? you tip your mitt and the jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else like stalag sixteen or fifteen or you kill him off and the krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks every one of us so what do you do?
who is it?
yeah security
so long sefton
no crack two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest
anybody here wanna double their bet?
how come the krauts knew about that stove security? and the tunnel? how come you can't lay down a belch around here without them knowing it?
fortyfive cigarettes the price has gone up
look this may be my last hot breakfast on account of they're going to take away that stove so will you let me eat it in peace?
a lot sharper sefton i'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers
it's the only one with dishes on the roof the studio's a front that's why they keep postponing its opening  gotta get in there
you would would you? listen stupe  the first week i was in this joint somebody stole my red cross package my blanket and my left shoe well i wised up since this ain't no salvation army  this is everybody for himself dog eat dog
you stink sefton
maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured  eh duke?
that's right
just what makes you and them krauts so buddybuddy?
ask security  you tell him price you've got me shadowed every minute of the day or haven't you found out yet?
and maybe a little something else?
a little something what?
let's get on with what? what is this anyway? a kangaroo court? why don't you get a rope and do it right?
you make my mouth water
milo you told me those doj agents are all over the place how could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  and how can you get in there anyway? with the cameras and the swipe cards 
you're all wire happy boys you've been in this camp too long you put two and two together and it comes out four only it ain't four
take it
why not?
thanks
you ain't going to squeal this one brother
no? aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? for a tipoff like this you know what the krauts would pay?
we're looking at it
forget it
i'll call the whole pot
okay security  what happened?
i can't just walk away
you betcha i said one of us is a stoolie a dirty stinkin' stoolie
how much more do we have to take from him?
there'll be no vigilante stuff not while i'm barrack chief
easy walked right through the gate past the guard like he was some kraut field marshal
only he ain't quite finished yet blondie  get that smudge pot tie it to steve's leg
everybody but joey and you know who
such nice boys it makes me sick to 
don't wear it out
tipping me off? i do not understand
which one of you is what?
no
you can't just walk in either
you are talking crazy
yes it would do we know each other?
twentyfive
they've got a summer house in nantucket with an upstairs polo field  you better put a canopy over his bunk
just a minute you made a couple of cracks before and i let them slide but i don't intend to take any more if you resent my having money start a revolution but get off my back
look lieutenant all your dough won't help you here because here you're on your own and no mother to throw you a lifebelt now let's see how good you can swim
my legs are frozen
you'd better get that blue blood circulating because we're busting out of this stinkhole in exactly    one minute and twenty seconds
sefton
what did you expect a st bernard dog?
they stop the construction work at six or seven the parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning even the early geeks don't get there before five
not you
what some brandy?
yeah
who doesn't suppose we wait until we hit the waldorf astoria
it's on me
you won't get off that cheap
what are the chances busting out of here?
we'll know in forty seconds  only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy
let's
what is your number?
is it two? or is it three? have you ever really noticed?
105353
that is correct  lieutenant dunbar i came to apologize for the accommodations ordinarily of course we never put officers up with enlisted men
i'll live
quite a transportation jam we are having outside of frankfurt they are very angry in berlin they will be even angrier on the east front waiting for that ammunition train don't you think so lieutenant?
i don't know what you're talking about colonel
of course you don't now lieutenant how would you like to join me in my quarters? i have a nice fire going
i'm okay here why bother?
no bother i'm very grateful for a little company you see i suffer from insomnia
ever try forty sleeping pills?
abfuehren
whaddo i do?
i didn't do it  i didn't do it
of course you did twentysix carloads of munitions gone off like a trick cigar the ss is running around in circles the gestapo is arresting the wrong people and von scherbach has caught the fish most amusing isn't it?
i want to sleep give me five minutes on that couch
ninethirty general von pfeffinger should be at his desk by now shall we call berlin and tell him the good news?
i didn't do it i didn't do it
i want to sleep i haven't slept for three days
you will remember the name? von scherbach? von scherbach
oh come now you threw a time bomb
how could i have had a time bomb? they searched me when they took me prisoner
naturally it would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk
so you believe me?
as for the blankets you will notice they are very warm fifty percent wool
they also smell of moth balls  when were they issued? this morning?
the men here used it for a trap door so we had to remove it temporarily
how long is temporarily? i trust not until july
i want to talk about lieutenant dunbar is this lieutenant dunbar?
it is
what exactly is he charged with?
whatever it is it's out of your jurisdiction this man is not a prisoner of war not any more he is a saboteur
he is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage
all i know is he did it i am satisfied
nothing
i am not according to the geneva convention 
simply this after the hostilities are ended there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission if this man should be convicted without proper proof you will be held responsible colonel von scherbach
interesting
isn't it?
perfectly all right i do not like boots
say schulz 
jawohl?
sprechen sie deutsch?
jawohl
then droppen sie dead
nothing?
ja  ja droppen sie dead always mit the jokes droppen sie dead
some are not bad at all
you always think i am a square i have been to america  i wrestled in milwaukee and st louis and cincinnati and i will go back the way the war is going i will be there before you
you should live so long
droppen sie dead  raus mit dem ofen los los
raus raus all of you

sugarlips shapiro frightening ain't it?
this is a good one  shut up everybody listen to this  'the president of the united states to harry shapiro greeting: having submitted yourself to a local board you are hereby notified to report' what do you know so now i'm a draft evader
you hold him i'll slug him
come on you little stooge hand over them keys

there's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone so go away
why sure
hey animal animal
i've been crazy about you for years i've seen every picture you've ever made six times i'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag
animal animal wake up
different?
this is me animal it's harry shapiro
you want to go?
no i want to draw
yes sergeant hoffman?
as the duly elected compound chief i protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud
anything else?
yes according to the geneva convention dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial
of course i'm aware of the geneva convention they will be given the burial they deserve or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twentyone cannons from the eastern front and give them a twentyone gun salute?
yes sir
you have a lieutenant here
okay yeah i did something naughty there's this amazing comix store in seattle  to tell you the truth i did it once or twice at stanford 'guess i can't keep anything from you
yes sir
curtains would do wonders for this barrack  you will not get them
kill it duke it's got us all spinning
take some men and get the antenna going let's see if we can catch the bbc
wait a second hoffy schulz says he's our best friend maybe he can give us a little hint
answer the question how do you rate all those privileges?
and don't blame me if you all wind up in the cooler
the guy i want to talk to is sefton where's sefton?  you haven't seen sefton have you?
i want everybody out of here we'll need a lot of commotion on the compound
maybe it's crazy but it's better than having dunbar dead
what?
just as you say hoffy but wouldn't it be smarter if i went out and kept schulz tied up?
good
we'll take care of schulz  come on
you have elected me security the way things have been going in this barracks i guess i've done a poor job and i want to make up for it is that asking too much?
i still say this is my tag any objections hoffy?
any objections men?
you'd better cut out in back of the south latrine
why the south latrine?
because that's where he is in the water tank
lay off schulz he's got a sickness he's krank
why doesn't he ask us to his party he's never even met you
sometimes i think he is fooling us with that crazy business
yeah? how would you like to see the guts of nine pals splattered all over your plane?  c'mon joey  don't be afraid
one more thing gentlemen the kommandant told me to pick up the radio
what radio?
the one you are hiding in the barrack don't you know? the one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound
come on everybody  let's go
just one question did you calculate the risk?
go on sefton  butt out
a little weak today
are we boring you?
he has thousands of employees milo 
says who?
says me
you take it out only you're going to have a riot on your hands
every time the men get red cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them
with your mother's pull how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
lay off i said  if you don't want your head handed to you
i'll say it is you spilled a little borscht on it
borscht?
we did it
there better not be anything missing this is private property
it's for the museum he knows you're a painter if anybody should be invited 
it adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy because i'm telling you the krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack and whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy
sure i heard it i still got one good ear
okay then put a guard on me i want you to put a guard on me because if anything goes wrong out there this time you won't have a patsy right?
right
so who stays with me? maybe joey? no  not joey wouldn't you feel safer with security on the job?
okay price you stay
you starting that again?
anybody cover?
that's right or would you rather see dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like manfredi and johnson?
look sefton i had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart 
what are you asking me?
milo 
i called it the last time didn't i?
you told them hoffy
who did?
you did
you off your rocker?
uhhuh fell right on my head  sprechen sie deutsch?
he's a nazi price is for all i know his name is preismaier or preissinger sure he lived in cleveland but when the war broke out he came back to the fatherland like a good little bundist he spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school gave him phony dogtags 
don't you know? because i got my own ideas  let's have that civilian stuff
you betcha there ought to be some reward money from mama say ten thousand bucks worth
what's the decoy?
i know you think i'm too attached to him but still i am close to gary and you're the most meaningful person in my life  i'm going back to the comix place why should i be killing myself
price when i go i want you to give me five minutes exactly five minutes to get dunbar out of that water tank then you throw price out into the compound nice and loud he'll draw every light from every goon tower it's our only chance to cut through what do you say barracks' chief?
shoot
let's synchronize the watches eleven fortytwo sharp
check
you can tell father murray to 
at ease he also says quote: all you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody unquote at ease monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool see oscar rudolph of barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht next: jack cushingham and larry blake will play frank denotta and mike cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp
nothing for kuzawa?
shapiro shapiro
just what makes you so popular?
give this to joey will you?
milo you 
oh
just one little thing how come you were so sure manfredi and johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
i wasn't so sure i just liked the odds
they're lying dead in the mud out there and i'm trying to find out how come
i'll tell you how come  the barrack chief gave them the green light and you our security officer said it'd be safe that's how come
they know about that gadget i'd worry more about the radio
what about the radio?
suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut
i went to school with a guy named price but that was in boston you're from cleveland aren't you
yes i'm from cleveland
i went to see the skywire model in gary's office you know just to hold it again
i thought that's what you said you're from cleveland and you were with the thirtysixth bomb group?
thirtyfifth
three hundred and sixtyfifth bomb squadron? out of chelveston?
are you questioning me?
just getting acquainted trying to make one friend in this barracks
don't bother sefton i don't like you i never did and i never will
a lot of people say that and the first thing you know is they get married and live happily ever after  i wonder what they're trying to pull out there?
what did you say?
amazing what you can do with five thousand pingpong balls isn't it?
where up joey's ocarina didn't you know?
just shut up?
the germans know where dunbar is
maybe just one word? kaput? because you're kaput price
will you get this guy out of my hair so i can go?
go where? to the kommandant's office and tell him where dunbar is?
i'll kill you for that
shut up  security officer eh? screening everybody only who screened you? great american hero from cleveland ohio enlisted right after pearl harbor when was pearl harbor price? or don't you know?
december seventh fortyone
what time?
six o'clock i was having dinner
six o'clock in berlin they were having lunch in cleveland  am i boring you boys?
look at me i'm gonna change
the one you took out of the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket
ach terrible such foolish boys such nice boys i'd better not talk about it it makes me sick to my stomach
suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little  just out of decency?
ja ja gewiss it is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day  gentlemen outside please do you want me to have trouble with the kommandant again
you are trying to say that an american would inform on other americans?
give me the radio
we have no radio
all right gentlemen i will find it myself now let's see
ich weiss alles
wie hat er's gemacht?
yeah? give me a goodbye kiss
ganz einfach streichhoelzer und eine zigarette
good morning schulz and how's mrs schulz? and all the little schulzes?
fine  fine
you americans you are the craziest people that's why i like you i wish i could invite you all to my house for a nice german christmas
how would you like to give frau schulz a pair of silk stockings for christmas?
you should go and see the doctor maybe i can   silk stockings?
here take them
and how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
who's the guy schulz?
what guy?
what?
the one you work with who is he? how do you do it?
i do not want those cigarettes
yes you do
no no
talk what? i do not know anything
how many do you want? a thousand?
not particularly
russian women prisoners?
ja ja droppen sie dead
yeah we were just passing out guns
i know you you're gonna run back to work right after dinner i want my kiss now
always joking always making wisecrackers
who's the other wrestler? the one with the mustache?
that is my wife
look at all that meat isn't she the bitter end
give it back you must not arouse yourselves
why don't we just plug up that tunnel  with the kommandant on one end and you on the other
it is not me it is the orders i am your friend i am your best friend here
we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs
the kommandant also sends you clean blankets he wants every man to have a new clean blanket
look at them lieutenant everybody is a clown how do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
don't we have any chopsticks?
a chicken?
just don't drool on it
what was i going to do with them? i only smoke cigars
come on let's get that mail anything for stanislaus kuzawa?
oh somebody was peeking
maybe those russian dames would take him
okay herr preismaier let's have the mail box
tell you what to do first get yourself a hundred cigarettes for the kraut guards then get yourself another face
hos qordu 
we'll consider it a prisoner exchange
i'm just trying to find out who you are
oh right hold on
where is he?
he is
then when is he going to engineering?
i don't know he bathed now he is roaming the ship he must be the only engineer in starfleet who does not go to engineering
full disruptors
thanks for pointing that out
captain perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony
i don't want to hear anymore about it i'm not going and that's final
twelve years sir
yes well congratulations ensign it wouldn't be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm
great
when is it expected back?
sorry captain the ribbon has already entered the galaxy it will pass through this sector in approximately thirtyone hours
the star's destruction has had numerous astrophysical effects within this sector however none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon
give me a list of those effects i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed no matter how insignificant
it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information
no sir i am finding it difficult to concentrate i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory
what do you mean?
i wanted to save geordi i tried but i experienced something i did not expect  i believe it was fear
but i did not deal with it sir i let it prevent me from helping my friend  does that make me a coward?
no and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which i believe you're beginning to experience: guilt
it's gonna get cold
guilt it is a most unpleasant feeling
wait the bozemanwhy did it change course?
the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction
can you project its course?
i believe so
i believe so
yes sir there are two in the veridian system
it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa
and destroy every planet in the system
veridian iii is uninhabited but veridian iv supports a preindustrial humanoid society
right wait a toast
population?
approximately two hundred thirty million
commander
sorry sir  there is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading
i have to find a way to get to soran
no but i'd stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you i still don't know why you dropped her in the water
i was attempting to get in the spirit of things i thought it would be humorous
it has occurred to me on several occasions but i believe this may be the appropriate time
wait a minute i thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net
that is true however i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse for thirtyfour years i have endeavored to become more "human" to grow beyond my original programming and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor this emotion chip is the only answer
you're just afraid to eat it
agreed
i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response
really? what do you feel?
i am uncertain i have had little experience with emotions i am unable to articulate the sensation
you get what?
during the farpoint mission we were on the bridge and you told a joke that was the punchline
the farpoint mission? data that was seven years ago
i know i just got it  it was very funny
thanks
it appears to be a magnetically sealed
no
i am sorry but i cannot stop myself i think something is wrong
i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays
we better get you back to the ship  la forge to enterprise
one minute to warp core breach
the station complement was nineteen
i am quitepreoccupied with concern about geordi
we all are data but we're going to get him back
i hope so sir
perhaps  yes if we sent a lowlevel ionic pulse it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems
all hands brace for impact
not like him is it? to do a thing like that without telling you you're not losing your hold on him are you?
the ships are bearing at 310 mark 215 distance: three light years
signal the closest starship we're in no condition to mount a rescue we don't even have a full crew aboard
on screen
beam them directly to sickbay
i'll go you have the bridge
there's some buckling on the starboard nacelle  we've also got a hull breach in the engineering section emergency forcefields are in place and holding
oh yes i remember everyone who was on the lakul every face even the ones who didn't make it
soran doesn't care about power or weapons all he cares about is getting back to the nexus
what's the "nexus"?
what happened to you?
he'll tell me when he gets home
i can't remember very much  what it looked like or how long i was there but i do remember how it felt
your "sixth sense" i've always wondered where it came from  and what about soran?
soran may still be obsessed with getting back and if he is he'll do anything to find that doorway again
but why destroy a star?  thank you guinan
you're in the nexus
for you this is where you wanted to be
but i never had a wife children a home like this
enjoy them jeanluc
i am on the enterprise i am also here  think of me as an "echo" of the person you know a part she left behind
left behind?
that'll be a test won't it?
when the enterpriseb beamed us off the lakul we were partially in the nexus the transporters locked on to us but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind
soran?
all of us
where is he now?
wherever he wanted to be
yeah they're great aren't they? you can go back and see them born go forward and see your grandchildren time has no meaning here
why would you want to leave?
can i?
yes where would you go?
i don't understand
instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something
i told you time has no meaning here if you leave you can go anywhere any time
what makes you think things will be any different this time?
you're right i'll need help  guinan will you come back with me? together we could
i can't leave i'm already there remember?
it's our pleasure
please please
oh of course
no no thank you
please i insist
you left spacedock without a tractor beam?
i know
lisa's an extremely valuable member of the skywire team we've got our eyes on her you keep yours on milo
it won't be installed until tuesday  ensign sulu try generating a subspace field around the ships that might break them free
risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair
yes yes it is
i'm from what you would consider the future; the 24thcentury
not exactly as i said this is some kind of
temporal nexus yeah i heard you  something's missing
you're a starfleet officer and you have a duty to
i don't need to be lectured by you i was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers and frankly i think the galaxy owes me one  i was like you once so worried about duty and obligations that i couldn't see anything past this uniform and in the end what did it get me? nothing not this time
better?
this is my uncle's barn in iowa
prick
she's not real either is she? nothing here is nothing here matters
that's right
close to retirement?
i hadn't planned on it
that's right
i take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
you could say that
of course if spock were here he'd say i was being an irrational illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that
did we do it? did we make a difference?
yes  thank you
i don't think he knows how
least i could do for a captain of the enterprise
i've warned ye about that back of yours you should have a doctor take a look at it
what do you mean you're not going? we promised
when i retired i swore i'd never set foot on a starship again and i meant it
and what would that be sir?
sulu when did he find the time for a family?
it's like you always said if something's important enough you make the time
phasing? to where?
there's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude
i thought you might
right what's that mean again?
an antimatter discharge directly ahead=8a it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away
a photon torpedo?
aye
load torpedo bays prepare to fire on my command
where are the deflector relays?
i always do
captain i don't know how much longer i can hold her together
what's normal?
normal is what everyone else is and what you are not
what do you want?
beggar we're at a disadvantage with outpost our experts aren't as smart as theirs sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly we need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights i'm taking a shot in the dark here i can offer you 32000 a year a buick i'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do
i was ordered to by the captain
no
what about guinan? what has she told you about me?
guinan? i don't know what you're talking about
yeah they're full of great ideas
i just stopped your heart for five seconds it felt like an eternity didn't it? did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
no i didn't know that
we learn something new about ourselves every day  now maybe i didn't make myself clear it is very important that you tell me exactly what captain picard knows
i told you everything you might as well just kill me right now
when we went to ancient rome for deanna's promotion we threw her to the lions remember?
it's just  i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something
aye aye sir  take the wheel commander
bad food brutal discipline  no women
make it so
we think they were looking for something they practically tore the place apart
hmm  inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector
you want me to contact starfleet?
is there a problem?
no sir
thank you number one
understood that will be all
like i said: shot in the dark
sir is there anything wrong?
no thank you
a quantum implosion has occurred within the amargosa star all nuclearfusion is breaking down
how is that possible?
they're just trying to decide whether a twenty yearold klingon bird of prey is any match for the federation flagship
too big how long until the ribbon arrives?
you may still somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise
yes fine if you'll excuse me
actually i'm here to see if there's anything i can do for you
well i appreciate your concern but i'd rather not discuss it right now thank you
it's  milo isn't it?
as ship's counselor it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not
you can't fool an empath captain i know exactly when i'm needed
very well i suppose i could make out my weekly report to starfleet command without your input  "admiral lusby regarding the unusual behavior of jeanluc picard: i find him increasingly irritable remote and uncooperative i recommend forced shore leave at a starbase facility in order to"
all right all right you've made your point
what i can't get out of my mind is the image of rene my nephew i just can't believe he's gone
in a way he was as close as i ever came to having a child of my own
ever since i was a little boy i remember hearing about the family line the picards that fought at trafalgar the picards that settled the first martian colony when my brother married and had a son
my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs
there's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life your own career
mr data scan the planet for lifeforms
yes sir i need to talk to you
yes yes captain thank you for coming
yes i need to return to the observatory immediately i must continue a critical experiment i was running on the amargosa star
the timing is very important on my experiment if it is not completed within the next twelve hours years of research will be lost
we're doing the best we can now if you'll excuse me
the thought had crossed my mind
the only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all so you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan  good luck
not if it means killing over two hundred million people  i wonder did your wife leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder?
what if i told you i found a new truth?
the nexus
time has no meaning there the predator has no teeth
give me two seconds with lacy here?  go on in i won't be a moment
thank you
you see the top yardarm now look to the
there are no other ships in the system
well that narrows it to klingon breen or romulan
trilithium?
an experimental compound the romulans have been working on in theory a trilithiumbased explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an antimatter weapon but they never found a way to stabilize it
why were they looking for it on a federation observatory? it doesn't make any sense
aye sir
the star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes
lursa and b'etor? this doesn't make any sense a renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star kidnaps geordi and escapes with a pair of klingon renegades why? what the hell's going on?
you don't know  i'm sorry  i was desperate  that's not me  i shot a cop  can you imagine what they'll do to me when i got to prison?
yeah hi thank you for seeing me
lock phasers and return fire
plasma coilsis there any way we can use that to our advantage?
i do not see how the plasma coil is part of their cloaking device
right and they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds  datalock onto that plasma coil
aye sir
we're only going to get one shot at this target their primary reactor with any luck their warp core should implode
all automates ready and functioning automatic moorings retracted all speeds available through transwarp drive
incredible machine helmsman onequarter impulse power
and we are gaining stand by tractor beam
tractor beam aye
have a seat
if he tries to get away with warp drive he's really in for a shock
execute
he has been here for some time i can feel his presence
don't give me your klingon mumbo jumbo  there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant
put me on the hailing frequency
sure  whatever games you wanna play
soon captain quite soon  
an energy reading from 'c" deck  from inside mr spock's quarters
mr chekov i ordered spock's quarters sealed
yes sir i sealed the room myself nevertheless  i am reading a life form there
i am i am sir
i can't get an answer starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference no one has time for those who only stand and wait
yes he has a long journey ahead
message acknowledged all units will be informed
sir commander starfleet on emergency channel he orders you to surrender this vessel
no reply chekov continue on course
mr scott we need everything you've got now
sir starfleet calling grissom again a warning about us
response?
nothing as before
what's grissom up to? will they join us or fire on us?  chekov break radio  silence send my compliments to captain esteban
my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley
aye sir
keep trying chekov at regular intervals
bones can you give me a quadrant biscan?
what did you see chekov?
for an instant a scout class vessel
could be grissom  patch in the hailing frequency  uss grissom this is enterprise calling come in please
short range scan mr chekov on screen mr sulu
scotty?
dr marcus it's your planet
wait a minute we don't know what we're talking about here
my goodness
locate
surge from astern sir aft quarter
on screen
it has to be gravitational fields were in flux it must have soft landed
in code to starfleet captain's spock's tube located intact on genesis surface will relay more data on subsequent orbits
what is it?
oh no you don't regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated" can you guarantee that?
not from here no
thank you <u>sir</u>
david sorry i'm late
it was racially motivated he's chinese he was and i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that don't they?
it's okay  i should have known you'd come saavik's right: this planet is unstable it's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours
david what went wrong?
i went wrong
i'm sorry sir just don't surrender genesis doesn't work i can't believe they'll kill us for it 
like your father so human  all units functional recorders are on scanning sector one foliage in fully developed state of growth temperature twenty two point two celsius
sector two indicating desert terrain minimal vegetation temperature thirtynine point four
sector three subtropical vegetation temperature   temperature decreasing rapidly 
it's snow snow in the same sector fantastic
 fascinating
all the varieties of land and weather known to earth within a few hours walk
if there's a civil rights violation but generally we let the local police and da do their work first
you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created
it's a little early to celebrate
underground deposit?
negative on surface a manufactured object
there's only one thing it could be short range scan
a photon tube
short range scan
as before metallic mass verifying triminium photon tube no new data
check for trace radiation infrared enhancement
 radiation residual level is minimal
i  just wanna help bring these guys to justice they're neonazis
cross referenced and verified an unidentifiable life form reading
 or <u>who</u>
i'll handle that later
my readings indicate great instability
we're not here to investigate geological aging we're here to find life forms
david 
but how could they have evolved so quickly?
spock's burial robe
grissom your message acknowledged will advise out
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack
let me look into it see what's being done frankly it's not my area
you mean we're stranded down here?
logic indicates that is the case
how can you be logical at a time like this? we have to get thee hell off this planet
that may be difficult
why don't you just call for <u>help</u>
i have already made one transmission too many
not exactly
why?
i used protomatter in the genesis matrix
protomatter an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable
'just didn't know who else to talk to
it was the only way to solve certain problems 
did your collaborator know?
my mother knew nothing about it that's why i asked her to leave genesis in my hands
so like your father you changed the rules
if i hadn't it might have been years  or never
and how many have paid the price for your impatience? how many have died? how much damage have you done and what is yet to come?
and spock with it they are joined together
 how long?
days maybe hours protomatter has made the situation unpredictable  i'm sorry
it will be hardest on spock soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood
they're not gonna send you right back
and outpost? you're happy there?
i don't understand
pon farr vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life
i still don't
i'll go
no i'll do it  give me your phaser
you said there wouldn't be any
" if the captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger" i know the book saavik
affirmative captain our readings are well below danger level
very well exercise caution lieutenant this landing is captain's discretion and i'm the one who's out on a limb
i'll try to remember that captain
yes sir
we concur saavik and saavik be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet i'm getting nervous
do you have an explanation?
yes saavik go ahead
request permission to beam aboard immediately
saavik does dr marcus think there could be  any chance of  ah  radioactive contamination?
none that i can detect sir
well all the same i'm going to advise starfleet and get instructions
i know but  let's do it by the book stand by on this channel  go
we are under attack stand by for evasive  stand by for 
your timing is excellent mr scott you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home how much refit time till we can take her out again?
'thought if i relocated it could help my case i'm writing programs for the local public access station where any whackjob with 100 bucks gets his own show? god does it suck  can you help me?
eight weeks sir  but you don't have eight weeks so i'll do it for ya in two
mr scott have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
certainly sir how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
your reputation is secure scotty  mr sulu take the con i'll be in my quarters
i'm sorry sir but as far as i'm concerned there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have
come come scotty young minds fresh ideas  be tolerant
thank you mr scott i'll try not to take that personally  my friends i can't ask you to go any further dr mccoy and i have to do this the rest of you do not
i'd be grateful admiral if you'd give the word
gentlemen may the wind be at our backs stations please
sir?
sure i'll see what i can do
the <u>doors</u> mr scott
scan for vessels in pursuit
aye sir
aye sir
aye those two hits should stop a horse let alone a bird
precautionary mr chekov shields up
oh god sir i dinna think so
what's wrong?
they've knocked out the damn automation center  i've got no control over anything
just him sir
'forgot to introduce you  i have a girlfriend
bones help spock everyone else find a station
saavik is david with you?
yes he is and someone else vulcan scientist of your acquaintance
this vulcan  is he alive?
he is not himself  but he lives he is subject to rapid aging  like this unstable planet
he gave his life to save us that is all i know
only one thing sir get him off this planet his aging is part of what's going on around us
goodbye david
what? what are you saying?
the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought  not in his body
you can't preempt yoga that's our biggest show
but we have spock alive that's more than we bargained for
or less what you describe is called fal tor pan  the refusion it is very dangerous the elders may not choose to attempt it
and if they don't? what will happen to spock?
 he will remain always as he is
much is at stake
yes and i know you
my father says you have been my friend you came back for me
you would have done the same for me
why would you do this?
because the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many
brian you wanna be a big deal don't you? that's your dream in life
the ship out of danger?
you saved the ship spock you saved us all don't you remember?
very well  mr chekov i need preapproach scan take the science station please
she's to be decommissioned
the word is no  i am therefore going anyway
count on our help sir
i'll need it sulu
full impulse power
aye sir warp speed
mr scott: as good as your word
no but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this we're gonna bring down outpost
can we hold speed mr scott?
what about grissom mr chekov?
yes sir it's getting larger as we close in
i think it's an energy form sir
yes enough energy to hide a ship wouldn't you say?
 a cloaking device?
red alert mr scott
fire mr scott
about a dozen officers and men
with some on the planet
what?
what about surface life signs?
close there 
come on
go sulu
best speed to vulcan mr chekov take the prisoners below
saavik send to ambassador sarek tell him we're coming in
it's been a while sir here we go retrothrusters
no sir no response
hmm very odd  scotty progress report?
approach control this is enterprise ready for docking maneuver
what'd they ever do for you?
my friends the great experiment: excelsior ready for trial runs
that's the good news he's home in bed full of tranquilizers and he promised me he'd <u>stay</u> there they say it's exhaustion  we'll see
good evening commander everything ready?
yes admiral step into my parlor
oh i'll have "mr adventure" eating out of my hand and i'll see you at the rendezvous  all my hopes
welcome home jim
indisposed sir
ah too bad well you have all done remarkable service under the most  difficult of conditions you'll be receiving starfleet's highest commendations and more importantly extended shore leaves
jim the enterprise is twenty years old we think her day is over
but we had requested  we were hoping to take her back to genesis
i'm sorry  i didn't mean toi'm glad actually i'm glad it's over  all this time  hiding  never being able to look anyone in the eyes always afraid that someone would find out who i was  never trusting anyone
great great we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door 
genesis? whatever for?
why  a natural desire to help finish the work we began
that's out of the question no one is going to genesis
may i ask why?
jim in your absence genesis has become a galactic controversy until the federation council makes policy you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of genesis consider it a quarantined planet and a forbidden subject
don't quote rules harry we're talking about loyalty and sacrifice one man who died for us another who has deep emotional damage 
now wait a minute this business about spock  and mccoy honestly i have never understood vulcan mysticism  i'm sorry but part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself understand?
harry you don't have to believe i'm not even sure i believe but if there's even a chance that spock has an eternal soul  then that is my responsibility
yours?
as surely as if it were my own  harry give me back the enterprise with scotty's help
what?
no jim enterprise would never stand the pounding
then i'll find a ship  i'll hire a ship
out of the question the council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to genesis
then let me speak to the council harry <u>please</u> i can <u>make</u> them understand
of course now take my suggestion enjoy your leave  and let all this tension blow away
you're right  thanks for the drink
any time
report status
torpedoes coming in  
who is this? how dare you 
wanna be a part of history?
who i am is not important that i have them is  i will let you speak to them
admiral your young friend is mistaken i meant what i said and now to show my intentions are sincere i am going to kill one of the prisoners
wait give me a chance 

all right damn you all right  give me a minute to inform my crew
no tricks kirk you have one minute
no tricks i'm looking forward to meeting you kirk out
you should take the vulcan too
no
but why?
gimme the coordinates?
because you wish it  
beam the vulcan up  and we talk
give me what i want  and i'll consider it
you fool  look around you this planet is destroying itself
yes exhilarating isn't it
if we don't help each other we'll all die here
perfect that's the way it shall be <u>give me genesis</u>

don't be a fool  give me your hand
i will speak with you alone kirk
is it your dish?
spare me your human platitudes kirk i have been to your government i have seen the genesis information and your own report
then you know how bravely your son met his death
"met his death"?  how could you his friend have assumed that? why did you leave him on genesis spock trusted you  and you denied him his future
i  saw no future 
you missed the point then and now only his body was "in death" kirk and you were the last one to be with him
yes i was
then you must know that you should have come with him to vulcan
but  why?
because he asked you to he entrusted you with his very essence  with everything was not of the body he asked you to bring him to us  and to bring that which he gave you: his katra his living spirit
sir your son meant more to me than you can know i'd have given my life if it would have saved his you must believe me when i tell you that he made no request of me
he's working backwards too  let's do number five?
he would not have spoken of it openly
then how 
kirk i must have your thoughts may i join your mind?
of course
yes
he asked you not to grieve
 yes
 the needs of the many outweigh
 the needs of the few
 or the one
you should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects
 spock
i have been and always shall be your friend live long and prosper
 no ` kirk bathed with sweat suddenly shudders in pain sarek opens his eyes removes his hands he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers opens his eyes
forgive me it is not here i assumed he had mindmelded with you it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near
but he couldn't touch me we were separated
i see and i understand  then everything that he was everything that he knew is lost and when i return home emptyhanded many shall mourn
yes but  how?
sarek what if he melded with someone else?
one alive one not yet both in pain
what must i do?
outpost was his baby sure on the other hand we just learned gary boyd owns the skywire satellites personally
you must bring them to mount selaya  on vulcan only there is the passage possible only there can both find peace
what you ask is difficult
you will find a way kirk if you honor them both you <u>must</u>
i am not sure only time will answer  kirk i thank you what you have done is 
what i have done i had to do
but at what cost? your ship your son
if i hadn't tried the cost would have been my soul
great power to control dominate destroy if it works
understood my lord
we are going to this "planet" even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the federation we will <u>act</u> for the preservation of our race we will seize the secret of this weapon the secret of ultimate power
outpost doesn't own em
success my lord
station
say the wrong thing torg and i will kill you too
i only meant my lord that if it's prisoners you want   there are life signs on the planet perhaps the very scientists you seek
but sir federation starship approaching
good  this is the turn of luck i have been waiting for
perhaps they wish to take you prisoner
they know we would die first
i trust my instincts  admiral kirk this is your opponent speaking
they outnumber us my lord 
that'd change with a criminal indictment
<u>we are klingons</u> once you control the ship i will transfer my flag there and we will take genesis from their own memory banks
yes my lord
steady continue on impulse power

wait wait

put him on screen  study him well
i underestimated him he did the one thing i didn't anticipate  he destroyed himself
sir may i 
killing his son was <u>stupid</u> it made kirk willing to die
i still can't believe eddie's gone
there's no hard evidence he knew about this anybody who could implicate him seems to've vanished
we still have the prisoners sir perhaps their information 
they are useless it was kirk i needed and i let him slip away
but surely our mission has not failed  ?
our mission is over i have failed a human has been bolder and more ruthless than i  that  is the real dishonor
how is that?
a twenty year space veteran yet you ask for the worst duty station in town i mean look at this place: the hind end of space
peace and quiet appeals to me lieutenant
well maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down but me: i need some challenge in my life some adventure even just a surprise or two
you know what they say lieutenant careful what you wish for: you may get it
good for you lieutenant
isn't there a stigma? bankrolling this guy?
but it's damn irregular no destination orders no encoded id
all true
well  what are we going to do about it?
i am going to do nothing about it <u>you</u> are going to sit in the closet
the <u>closet</u>? have you lost all sense of reality?
this isn't reality this is fantasy
it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix 
it's new  have you any idea what you're saying?
i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications doctor as a matter of cosmic history it has always been easier to destroy than to create 
not anymore now you can do both at the same time according to myth the earth was created in six days watch out: here comes genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes 
stigma? larry 60 billion buys you some slack in this world
i don't dispute that in the wrong hands 
would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands my coldblooded friend? are you in favor of these experiments?
but as you are so fond of observing doctor i'm not human
you're not going in there  
i'm afraid i can't stop to discuss this logically 
that's all you have to say?
i'm not a drama critic
they'll learn galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young doctor
'beware romulans bearing gifts' happy birthday
i only use it for medicinal purposes don't be a pring
and the kid who wrote skywire  then gave it away? they're calling him the digital robin hood
twentytwo eightythree
takes the stuff a while to ferment gimme
more antiques for your collection  cheers
four hundred years old you don't find many with the lens still intact
uh  what are they?
for your eyes for most patients of your age i generally administer retlax five to restore flexibility of the lens
but i'm allergic to retlax
exactly happy birthday
amazing i don't know what to say 
say thank you
milo surprised he's not your guest
thank you
bones i don't want to be lectured
what do you want? damn it why isn't there a girl here? you know this has nothing to do with age this is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping galaxies
spare me your notions of poetry please we all have our assigned duties and
bull you're hiding  hiding behind the rules and regulations 
and who am i hiding from?
from yourself admiral
i'm your doctor and i'm your friend jim get back your command get it back before you really do grow old before you turn into part of this collection
ah
the inspection will continue once we're underway doctor
we tried
as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of reopening old wounds
computer request security procedure and access to project genesis summary
at the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it you said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would rearrange the universe
there may still be time you gave as good as you got
i got beat we're only alive because i knew something about these ships that he didn't
he's been there and hasn't found what he wants can you spare someone? there may be people hurt
i can spare me
this one looks like a steward they're not warm but rigor hasn't set in this didn't happen all that long ago jim
where <u>they</u> went saavik
then this will be your big chance to get away from it all
you better believe everybody's trying to sign him up
how can you think of food at a time like this?
our first order of business is survival
it's like the garden of eden
and almost got tossed out of the academy
we each face death every day we're alive saavik
i'm taking this bunch to sick bay
young i feel young doctor
commander we are receiving this is regula i go ahead
dr marcus good we're en route to you and should be there in three days
en route? why? we weren't expecting you for another three months has something happened?  <u>has something happened</u>? do you read us?
oh hi
all went well nothing has happened ceti alpha vi has checked out
we have received new orders upon our arrival at regula i all materials of project genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at ceti alpha vi
the order comes from starfleet command dr marcus direct from the general staff
but genesis is a civilian project under my control 
i have my orders
i'm sorry you feel that way doctor admiral kirk's orders are confirmed please prepare to deliver genesis to us upon our arrival reliant out
message breaking up carol what's wrong? what's wrong?
 can't read you repeat
repeat what's wrong? what's wrong?
 taking genesis away from us
he's pretty tight with his family
taking genesis? who? who is taking genesis?
 see you but can't hear did you order?
what order? who's taking genesis?
 please help us jim won't let them have without proper repeat on whose authority
carol
jim please 
stage one of our experiments was conducted in the labora tory stage two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; stage three will involve the process on a plane tary scale what follows is a computer projected simulation of stage three please watch closely
why? why didn't you tell me?
how can you ask me that? were we together? where we going to be? you had your world and i had mine i wanted him in mine not chasing through the universe with his father
the matrix formed in a day the life forms grew later  at a wildly accelerated rate can i cook or can't i?
we could move 'em up here
is that a poem?
something spock was trying to tell me on my birthday
and bored i know but maybe it is something they can
come on mother that's just the military mentality never put off tomorrow what you can put off today if there's one atom of life
i know i know
thanks a lot no respect from my offspring 
par for the course you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
maybe
every time we have dealings with starfleet i get nervous  we're dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? that's exactly the 
i don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks next time we'll design a bigger one
at least i'm not a clouted fen sucked hedgepig
i'm sorry
he just likes to write code he's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything
who 
mistake? we're all alone here they waited until everyone was on shiftleave to do this reliant is supposed to be at our disposal not viceversa
starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years i cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event
mother go back
go back i'm going to kill him
you do that and you'll have murdered your father
i don't understand who's responsible for all this? who is khan?
but we can't just sit here  
this is just to give us something to do isn't it?  come on
we've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner
i think they call him the "houseman" 'cause "guard" sounds too weird
damn are you sure? maybe the scanner's out of adjustment 
i suppose it <u>could</u> be a particle of preanimate matter caught in the matrix
all right let's get on the commpic to doctor marcus maybe it's something we can transplant
you know what she'll say
captain this is the garden spot of ceti alpha vi 
i can hardly see 
i saw it  
there's an airlock
ssssh
what's the matter  ?
milo? gary boyd i'm hoping you and your friend can come up here we've made some amazing strides in digital convergence i'd love to show them to you
never mind hurry
what do you want with us? i demand 
marooned on ceti alpha v he's completely mad admiral he blames you for the death of his wife
<u>this is ceti alpha v</u> ceti alpha vi exploded six months after we were left here the shock shifted the orbit of <u>this</u> planet and everything was laid waste <u>admiral</u> kirk never bothered to check on our progress it was only the fact of my genetically engineered intellect that enabled us to survive on earth two hundred years ago i was a prince with power over millions  now like prometheus i have been left by admiral kirk to digest my own entrails
captain kirk was your host you repaid his hospitality by trying to steal his ship and murder him
and i'll wager he never told you about his shipmate the beautiful and courageous lieutenant mcgiver who gave up everything to join me in exile out of love and see how <u>admiral kirk</u> requited her devotion  she's dead as earth
there is some pain at first i am told and then the effects are quite benign  until the end that was what i learned from watching my wife
umm and would admiral kirk have access to such information?
i would think so sir he's on the fleet general staff
then to whom do you report directly regarding genesis?
you would? wow when would we come?  'think he hung up
to doctor marcus the civilian director of the experiments on space laboratory regula i
i see helmsman?
you realize sir that they will attempt to contact admiral kirk and confirm the order
<u>we were still there</u> you dumb bastard we could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room 
i'm doctor marcus
she's making it up my father was professor 
we appear to have plenty of time
what?
he's on a build up to detonation
how soon 
would you like a coke or something?
we encoded four minutes 
we'll beam aboard and stop it 
you can't
uh no  i should be on the bridge
are you running away from me?
no i  i guess i'm not what you expected
i didn't expect anything
that makes two of us  lieutenant saavik was right: you never have faced death 
not like this  no i haven't faced death i cheated death i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity i know nothing
you knew enough to tell saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life 
oh no thanks
it was just words
but good words that's where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them
i'm trying david
so am i my friends were killed too
i am truly sorry
is that what you came here to say?
mainly  and also that i'm proud  very proud  to be your son
only half of you would get there
the admiral's son
don't you believe it
there's a rumor going around maybe you've heard it
oh i believe it
i don't know
it's not much different from enterprise  when i was a guest aboard her some years ago captain kirk kindly allowed me to memorize her technical manuals and now mr chekov let us review: you say you have no details of project 'genesis' ?
let them eat static
they're still running with shields down
of course we're one big happy fleet ah kirk my old friend do you know the klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  it is very cold in space
locking phasers on target
raise them 
<u>where's the override</u>??
we can't fire sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive we must withdraw
low enough to relay internet traffic
no
sir we must  we must repair the damage enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere
warp drive still inoperative all other systems should be restored shortly
visual 
rake her
<u>full power damn you</u>
inoperative
raise the shields
i shall avenge you 
what is the meaning of this attack? where is the crew of the reliant?
among other things we know convergence is the real superhighway: all the pc's tv's phones etc linked together why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
surely i have made my meaning plain i mean to avenge myself upon you admiral i've deprived your ship of power and when i swing round i mean to deprive you of your life 
khan listen to me  if its me you want i'll have myself beamed aboard all i ask is that you spare my crew
that is a most intriguing offer typical i must say of your sterling character let me think
don't play with me kirk my hand is on the phaser control 
give me some time to recall the data on our computers 
i give you sixty seconds admiral
 to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message an order to lower reliant's damn shields
i've given you no word to keep admiral in my judgment you simply have no alternative
i take your point stand by to receive our transmission
here it comes now spock
skywire
still 'old friend' you've managed to kill just about everyone else but like a poor marksman you keep missing the target
perhaps i no longer need to try
khan
chekov who is this man?
listen to me  you men and women 
save your strength captain these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born do you mean he   never told you the tale? to amuse you captain? never told you how the <u>enterprise</u> picked up the <u>botany bay</u> lost in space from the year 1996 myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
i've never even met admiral kirk 
admiral? he didn't tell you how <u>admiral</u> kirk sent seventy of us into exile on this barren sand heap with only the contents of these cargo bays to sustain us?
all is well sir you have the coordinates to beam up genesis
first things first captain kill admiral kirk
ludwig?  he's gay  are you jealous?
it needs a more objectoriented language this doesn't scale does it?
aye sir
we'll be going to warp speed 
aye sir 
just the batteries sir i can have auxiliary power in a few minutes 
we don't have minutes can you give me phaser power?
a few shots sir
i'm going down to the station
uhura send to commander reliant: prepare to be boarded
i'm trying sir stand by
try the emergency channels
you'd have to start practically from scratch but this is all you'd be working on no marketing meetings no product seminars we can't waste the time half the valley's working on convergence so're media conglomerates cable companies phone companies 'can't finish second milo there is no second now what would you like to ask me?
enterprise to reliant come in reliant
picture mr saavik
spock?
scotty let's have it
admiral 
do it while we have time
sensors captain?
i say again this is enterprise please acknowledge signal please 
we'll beam aboard alert transporter room 
i had me a wee bout  but dr mccoy pulled me through
i do
oh? a wee bout of what mr scott?
my sister's youngest admiral crazy to get to space
every young boy's fancy i seem to remember it myself  very well mr scott are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise?
give the word admiral
mr scott the word is given
aye sir
he wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago  and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance
no promises mr scott on your way
all right we'll do the job with auxiliary power
he'll die  
yeah? i wanna feel like i did when i wrote that but i'm 42 that's 100 in cyberyears i look at you and see the things that got me here  but somehow got away
admiral this is spock
engine room reports auxiliary power restored we can proceed at impulse power
best speed to regula i kirk out scotty i've got to ask: any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
admiral if we go by the book like lieutenant saavik hours could seem like days
i read you captain let's have it
not at present
right on schedule admiral just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard
midshipman first class peter preston engineers mate sir
yes sir
i see well shall we start with the engine room?
okay i'm gary
oh do you? have you any idea midshipman preston how many times i've had to listen to mr scott on the comm telling me his troubles? have you any idea the ribbing i've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap?
oh no sir this is the finest engine room in the whole star 
the word is given: warp speed
aye
i am understandably curious
the <u>kobayshi maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment  as i recall you took the test three times yourself your final solution was shall we say unique?
it had the virtue of never having been tried
yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality
than you yes i see that by the way thank you for this
'it was the best of times it was the worst of times' message spock?
do i?
none of which i am consciously aware  except of course happy birthday  surely the best of times
the enterprise i must check in before your inspection and you?
home
welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you
yes we've been through death and life together
to be sure captain
regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves
i told starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant spock: those cadets of yours  how good are they? how will they respond under real pressure?
like all living beings admiral each according to his gifts the ship is yours
that won't be necessary: just take me to regula i
somebody said i'm just another philistine with reproductions
excuse my presumption but i do not agree as a teacher on a training mission i am content to command a starship if we are to go on actual duty it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command
but it may be nothing; garbled communications why don't you
you proceed from a false assumption i am a vulcan i have no ego to bruise
i was going to remind you of nothing least of all that which you know well  your mistake if i may be so bold was promotion commanding a starship is your first best destiny anything else is a waste of material
i would not presume to debate you
that is wise in any case were i to invoke logic logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
or the one
i'd best talk with mr scott first so that he may in his own words explain the situation to his cadets
how far?
twelve hours and fortythree minutes present speed
that's insane you're ahead of your time
give up genesis she said what in god's name does that mean? give it up to whom?
it might help my analysis if i knew what genesis was
yes
the power of creation 
have they proceeded with their experiments?
the tape was made a year ago i can only assume they've reached phase two by now 
really dr mccoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn logic suggests 
chekov's on reliant isn't he?
it would explain a great many things 
raise shields energize phasers stand by to 
that's what i told her my wife
who? who knew just where to hit us? and <u>why</u>?
one thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power
visual  mr sulu divert everything to the phasers 
too late 
who the <u>hell</u> are they?
at least we know he hasn't got it just keep nodding as though i'm giving orders saavik punch up the data charts of reliant's command console  hurry
it's all we've got
the prefix code is 16309 all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code
wait for my signal spock  too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again
and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area
don't spend too much time searching you ever vetted somebody's old code before?  it's a different skill stay close to the surface the besthidden secrets are in plain sight you know the best place to hide a leaf right?  in a tree
affirmative admiral
 blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond?
regula is class "d' it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space
reliant could be hiding behind that rock
a distinct possibility
engine room scotty do we have enough power for the transporters?
aye sir 
establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with mr scott
be careful jim
not much admiral we have partial main power
if i was your boyfriend i might be
maybe i'm going too fast
that's it?
best we could do in two hours
she can outrun us and outgun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four
scotty can we make it inside?
best speed scotty
steady as you go
uhura patch me in 
he won't break off now if he followed me this far he'll be back but from where?
he's intelligent but not experienced his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking
the ship  out of danger?
too fast? at least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems milo they 
yes 
or the one
spock
i have been  and always will be  your friend live long and prosper
i have an urgent commpic from space lab regula i for the admiral dr carol marcus
in my quarters uhura
yes sir
transmission jammed at the source sir
damn alert starfleet headquarters i want to talk with starfleet command
sir  we won't leave you behind
take a look at this slightly different approach
uhura if you don't hear from us there won't be anybody behind kirk out  you gentleman can remain here or
prayer mr saavik the klingons do not take prisoners  captain
permission to speak candidly sir?
very well
i don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities
and why not?
because there was no way to win
a nowin situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you?
 no sir it has not
how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life wouldn't you say?
you're making me young again
as i indicated admiral that thought had not occurred to me
then you have something new to think about carry on
it is still regulation admiral
lieutenant selfexpression does not seem to be one of your problems
i wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating
you earned it
i did not think so
you're bothered by your performance on the <u>kobayashi maru</u>
i failed to resolve the situation
there is no correct resolution it is a test of character
well  you sent for me
may i ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
you may ask lieutenant
humor that is a difficult concept  it is not logical
we learn by doing lieutenant
take the test again
energize defense fields
who?
hurry
we're finding it  please <u>please</u>  you've got to give us time  the bridge is smashed computers inoperative
there is no such regulation
right right
phasers on stun move out
erased
if stage two was completed it was underground  she said it was going to be underground
stage two of what?
as your teacher mr spock is fond of saying: i like to think there always are possibilities
the <u>kobayashi maru</u> sir
on the test sir will you tell me what you did? i'd really like to know
i reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship
<u>what</u>?
i changed the conditions of the test i received a commendation for original thinking  i don't like to lose
what're you implying
then  you never faced that situation  faced death
come come lieutenant you of all people go by the book hello spock you remember dr marcus
' no uncoded messages on an open channel'
they just don't want us going in there
at what
all stop sir
descend ten thousand meters stand by photon torpedoes
power levels quite low sir
mr scott can you get the mains back on line?
aye sir
nothing
two minutes ten seconds
engine room what's happening?
three minutes thirty seconds
distance from reliant
aye sir
i'll be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer
understood sir
dismiss the company
as you were mr saavik
aye sir on course to ceti alpha all is well
i'm sure
good i believe you already know my uh son 
aye sir 
i am delighted; any chance to go aboard enterprise however briefly is always an excuse for nostalgia
i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month you'll have your first command: uss excelsior
thank you sir i've looked forward to this for a long time
you've earned it but i'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks i don't believe these kids can steer
stop engines
engage warp engines 
visual
trying sir
the purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath but the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one being obsessive isn't a crime it's a character trait
scotty
phasers locked
<u>i did nothing</u>  except get caught with my britches down i must be senile mr saavik you just keep right on quoting regulations meantime let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been 
try again
battle stations
best guess mr sulu fire when ready
project parabolic course to avoid entering neutral zone
aye captain
i'm aware of my responsibilities mister
 now entering the neutral zone
if you were my boyfriend i'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail tenthousand miles away
definitely
inform the klingons we are on a rescue mission
i'll try captain
aft thrusters sir
course heading captain?
ready sir
honors  hup
no power to the weapons system sir
what did you expect lieutenant?
he's very human
we can't all be perfect saavik you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land around you are humans and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you tolerance is logical
were the flags for teddy?
aye sir
thank you mr saavik
never sir
aye sir
lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations
aye sir
by the book
i exaggerated
you are half human the computer knows that
the question is irrelevant
just once 'guess i was worried we didn't have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure
spock the retraining of your mind has been in the vulcan way so you may not understand feelings but as my son you have them they will surface
as you wish since you deem them of value but i cannot wait here to find them
where must you go?
to earth to offer testimony
you do this  for friendship?
i do this because i was there
spock does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
i would accept that as an axiom
then you stand here alive because of a mistake  made by your flawed feeling human friends they have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u>  you  was more important to them
humans make illogical decisions
did you?
 they do indeed
just a couple of kooks
fine just fine
don't tell me fish stories kiddo i've known you too long
bob it's tearing me apart
i know i feel the same thing but we're between a rock and a hard place we can't keep them without risking their lives and we can't let them go without a taking the same chance
yeah
and finally they're not human beings you know their intelligence has in no way been proven comparable to ours 
i don't know about you but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence  i mean whales may not have painted the mona lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either
not at all you gave me things to think about you always do you do sound a little wrecked why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
talk about work? never
why don't i?
gillian 
i tried to clear things up professor scott i explained you'd come all the way from edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at plexico but they don't seem to know anything about it
back home we call him the miracle worker
indeed may i offer you gentlemen anything?
please
a moment alone please
we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot
i just wish we could cloak the stench
what do you mean?
i meant did you find other stuff to 
i mean <u>him</u> back at his post like nothing happened i don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters
it'll come back to him
are you sure?  that's what i thought
mr sulu take us home
dammit jim they've made him into a goddam greenblooded computer
no way  somebody has to keep an eye on him
spock start your computations for time warp  come on bones let's pay scotty a visit
we've done it before
sure slingshot around the sun if you pick up enough speed you're in time warp if you don't you fry
would you prefer to do nothing?
oh yeah
 that's the general idea
that's crazy
if you have a better idea  now's the time
let's hope so bones mr sulu set us down in golden gate park
captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source
what do you think spock?
cramps
tearing of the middle meningeal artery
come on pavel
pavel can you hear me? give me your name and rank
you've been coming in early
not me bones they did it
uhura is busy i am monitoring
umm well just wanted to say  nice to have your katra back in your head not mine  i mean i may have carried your soul but i sure couldn't fill your shoes
 my shoes
forget it  how 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? life death life things of that nature?
i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines
spock it's me bones i mean our experience was unique you really have gone where no man has gone before can't you tell me what it felt like?
it would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference
you're joking
a joke is a story with a humorous climax
it helps alice said it would help to focus on something  'don't know what i'd do without her
you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death?
pardon me doctor i am hearing many calls of distress
really? you think this is its way of saying "hi there" to the people of the earth?
there are millions of other species on earth doctor only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man
i liked him better before he died
that's crazy who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
 my god
that is what i said doctor
then how?
hamlet act i scene 4
34000 but they're real short lines 'just came out that way
your perception is correct doctor in order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd century i have used our journey back through time as a referent calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve
naturally  so what is your problem?
acceleration is no longer a constant
well you're gonna have to take your best shot
 best shot?
guess spock your best guess
"guessing" is not in my nature
well nobody's perfect
no spock it means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts
it is
no matter what happensi'm glad i met you
the wrong place?
we're just  observing
i was not informed about observers
reading the patient's vital signs
how do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma?
fundoscopic examination 
fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases
a simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure
my god man drilling holes in his head is not the answer the artery must be repaired without delay or he will die so put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient
captain their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power
can you isolate the wave?
the answer's not in the box it's in the band
negative it's impacting on all our systems
captain all systems have failed we are functioning on reserve power only
we're out of control  rig for collision
yes under "us government" now we need directions
i have the coordinates of the reactor
 it gives me a great sense of history
it gives me a great sense of danger we have to beam in next to the reactor room not in it
depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor
like what?
like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is
you look a little tired
all right let's take it from the top
the top of what?
name?
my name?
no <u>my</u> name
i do not know your name
you play games with me and you're through
i am? may i go now?
i varn you if you don't lie on the floor i vill have to stun you
go ahead stun me
i'm okay it's going well
i'm wery sorry but 
i'm impressed mr chekov a lot of effort for a short voyage
we are in an enemy wessel sir i didn't wish to be shot down on thee way to our own funeral
most prudent  engine room report scotty
that's odd uhura what's on the comm channels?
shields aye
may fortune favor the foolish  mr sulu warp speed
sir heat shields at maximum
dr mccoy you mr scott and commander sulu will convert us a whale tank
and admiral it's the enterprise
'have a look?
understood what is your plan?
stabilize energy reserve report helm:
mr sulu switch to manual control
mr president the probe has passed through all quadrants the starships shepard and yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized
"neutralized?" how?
we don't know it's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand
can you protect us?
we are launching everything we have
whoever said the human race was logical?  now if you'll follow me i'll introduce you to the institute's pride and joy
communicate? communicate what? you have no right to be here
sure
i suppose they told you that?
the hell they did
i was not
you're not one of those guys from the military are you? trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes or some dipshit stuff like that?
is there something wrong with the one i have?
to put it mildly since the dawn of time men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point a hundred years ago using handthrown harpoons they did plenty of damage  but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century
it's perfect spock: a male a female together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky
why's that?
well for one thing we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day
how soon?
my dad was a compulsive gambler only he didn't think he was that applied to guys who didn't have a "system" "losers" who played games of chance he could "read" people so chance had nothing to do with it no matter how deep a hole he dug himself he'd give you the whole speech and you'd better not point out the obvious  his creditors would catch up to him loan sharks or whatever he'd wake us in the middle of the night off we'd go again
soon it's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see i've grown quite attached to them this way
i assure you that won't be necessary we were only trying to help
the hell you were buster your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales
came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies huh?
there's really very little point in my trying to explain
i buy that what about him?
he's harmless  back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley i think he did too much lds
lds?? are you dyslexic on top of everything else? come on lemme give you a lift i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases  that's why i work with whales
we don't want to be any trouble
you've already been that c'mon
what would you tell the kids? at your new school? you had to come up with a good story right?
don't mention it and don't try anything either i got a tire iron right where i can get at it
uh huh what about you? where you from?
iowa
a landlubber come on what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? was it some kinda macho thing? if that's all i'm gonna be real disappointed i hate that macho type
can i ask <u>you</u> something?
go ahead
what's going to happen when you release the whales?
what does that mean exactly? take their chances
it means that they will be at risk from whale hunters  same as the rest of the humpbacks  what did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the institute about extinction?
well that's something i'da let you off right here
worse?
we can't tell you  please just  let me finish i can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales
then 
in fact we may be able to help  in ways that frankly you couldn't possibly imagine
or believe i'll bet
very likely you're not exactly catching us at our best
how did you know gracie's pregnant? nobody knows that
it's his way
implicitly
good  a large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions and a michelob
just lucky i guess
cause he was a liar and i hated him  "get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world" the more he mocked me the deeper i went cause if being savvy meant being like him   guess that's why i'm kind of clueless even now didn't cultivate my conniving side 'not sure i even have one
you're upset about losing the whales
 you're very perceptive
how will that be done exactly?
they'll be flown in a special 747 to alaska and released there
flown and that's the last you'll see of them?
see yes but we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them
you know i could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted
you? you can't even get from sausalito to san francisco without a lift
if you have such a low opinion of my abilities how come we're having dinner?
i told you: i'm a sucker for hard luck cases besides i want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that gracie is pregnant and calls you admiral
i'm glad i met you
don't be so hard on yourself with a brain like yours you could connive with the best of 'em i bet
hm?
my whales? where could you take them where they'd be safe?
it's not so much a matter of a place as of time
sorry the time would have to be right now
what do you mean now?
let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived  problem is they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year so that as they say is that  damn
what's what?
you got a pocket pager? what are you a doctor?
tell me when the whales are going to be released?
 who are you?
'sorry about the late notice
who do you think i am?
no i'm from iowa i just work in outer space
well i was close i knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later
all right the truth?
i'm all ears
that's what you think  okaytruth i'm from what on your calendar would be the late 23rd century i've been sent back in time to bring two humpback whales with me in an attempt to repopulate the species
well why didn't you say so? why all the coy disguises?
you want the details?
are you kidding? i wouldn't miss this for all the tea in china
then tell me when the whales are leaving
i couldn't do it at work cause of security or at home for  obvious reasons
jesus you are persistent  okay your friend was right gracie is not only pregnant she is very pregnant at noon tomorrow  in what is sure to be a media circus  the whales get shipped out
noon tomorrow?
you asked  now will you tell me something?  george and gracie's transmitter what's the frequency?
it wouldn't be my first choice no
so there we are
lemme tell you something i'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century if i have to i'll go to the open sea to get them but i'd just as soon take yours  better for me better for you and better for them
i bet you're a damn good poker player
think about it  but don't take too long because i'm out of time if you change your mind this is where i'll be
here in the park?
right
i'm not much good at handwriting or parties
yes and i'm glad you're here though i'll admit you picked a hellova time to drop in
have i flipped out?  is any of this real?
it's all real look  the storage tanks for the whales
but kirk
we'll bring them up just like we brought you it's called a transporter beam
kirk they're gone
 gone?
they were taken last night i wasn't told they're in alaska by now
 damn
a spaceship with a missing man
oh that's right you're "clueless"
calm yourself nurse  scotty get us out of here
yes if you have a chart on board i can show you
all i need is the radio frequency to track them
what are you talking about? i'm coming with you
you can't our next stop is the 23rd century
what do i care? i've got nobody but those whales
i have no time to argue gillian or even tell you how much you've meant to us the <u>frequency</u>
all right the frequency is 401 megahertz
thank you for everything  beam me up scotty
you need me
you see what's hanging on the wall?
mr sulu: full power descent
he means our chances of getting home are not very good you might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong
i belong here  suppose by some miracle you do get them through  who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales?
 you have a point
you're going to your ship i'm going to mine science vessel i've got 300 years of catchup learning to do
you mean this is  goodbye?
why does it have to be goodbye?
well i as they say in your century  i don't even have your phone number how will i find you?
don't worry i'll find <u>you</u>  see you around the galaxy
permission granted
i do know gary i feel the same way i thought i was coming here for a job but it's meant a lot more
thank you admiral
jim spock jim remember?
it would be improper to refer to you as jim while you are in command admiral also i must apologize for my attire  i seem to have misplaced my uniform
well i find that understandable  i mean you've been through a lot  station please
a distinct possibility admiral the president did say the transmission was directed at the earth's oceans
uhura can you modify the probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
to the onboard computer room to confirm my suspicion
as suspected the probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales
whales?
the sounds but not the language we would be responding in gibberish
i do know you focus on the big problem but somewhere down the chain something breaks down something gets destroyed at first it's upsetting you feel you've lost control
is there any other planet where this species exists?
the humpback was indigenous to earth earth of the past
that leaves us no choice we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth
that would be futile admiral the probe would neutralize us easily
but we can't turn away is there no alternative?
there is one but i cannot guarantee its success we could attempt to find some humpback whales
in progress admiral
uhura get me through to starfleet command
what is our target in time?
the late 20th century
'startup not 50 miles from here kid's on prozac
surely you can be more specific
not with this equipment i have had to program some of the variables from memory
what are the variables?
availability of fuel components; mass of the vessel through a time continuum and the probable location of humpbacks in this case the pacific basin
you've programmed that from memory?
i have
judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century
well done mr spock
admiral if i may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time
quite right spock mr chekov engage cloaking device
maybe we should all get on it
explain
if memory serves there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects by the beginning of the fusion era these reactors had been replaced but at this time we should be able to find some
but you said toxic
we could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber causing crystalline restructure theoretically
where would we find these reactors theoretically
nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels
and they will be again spock that's the beauty of it  how much?
simple logic will suffice we need a map  that one should do
how do you know this?
 simple logic
right
there may be a little less trust after your outburst
yes
admiral may i ask you a question?
spock don't call me admiral don't you remember: you used to call me jim now what's your question?
your use of language has altered since our arrival it is currently laced with  shall i say  more colorful metaphors: "double dumb ass on you"  and so forth
you mean profanity that's simply the way they talk here nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word you'll find it in all the literature of the period
for example?
ah the giants
admiral if we were to assume these whales are ours to do with as we please we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction
yes?
about those colorful metaphors we discussed i don't think you should try to use them
nothing does still i want him to like me
why not?
well for one thing you haven't quite got the hang of it
i see
and another thing it is not always necessary to tell the truth
i cannot tell a lie
you don't have to lie you could exaggerate
exaggerate
you've done it before can't you remember?
the hell i can't
what else did you learn from your mind meld?
gary don't worry we 
they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man
they have a right to be  do you think they'll help us?
i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions
 i see
how will playing cards help?
he meant what you were saying on the tour: that if things keep on the way they're going humpbacks will disappear forever
the tank will be finished by morning
that's cutting it closer than you know what about team two?
no word since beamin we can only wait for their call
damn damnit we've been so lucky we have the two perfect whales in our hands but if we don't move quickly we'll lose them
just do what i'm asking
in that event the probabilities are that our mission would fail
our <u>mission</u> goddam it spock you're talking about the end of every life on earth you're half human haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>
thank you spock
is that the logical thing to do spock?
no admiral but is the human thing to do
right  will you help us?
admiral you must wait one damn minute
mr scott cannot give me exact figures admiral so i will  make a <u>guess</u>
<u>you?</u>  spock that's extraordinary
hardly admiral i cannot even guarantee we will escape the sun's gravity i will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory
longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes 
they did admiral
then where the hell are we?
no data admiral computers are nonfunctional
i will admiral
weapons systems?
continue on course chekov any signs of federation escort?
steady as she goes
mr sulu we need breakaway speed
hang on sir nine point seven point eight breakaway threshold
steady  now mr sulu
let's go
 aye sir?
what is our condition?
sir braking thrusters seem to have fired
picture please
we'll divide into teams commanders chekov and uhura are assigned to the uranium problem
go mr sulu
advise reaching 10000 steer threeonezero
threeonezero aye
uhura scan for the whales 401 megahertz
wing to cruise configuration full impulse power
longitude 109 
aye sir threeonezero to the bering sea eta: 12 minutes
hover on my mark mr sulu mr chekov stand by decloaking  scotty ready for power build up  mark mr sulu
picture uhura
ground cushion keep the nose up if you can 
aye sir
communications systems ready communications officer  ready as she'll ever be
mr sulu?
overlapping distress calls some from starships others
on screen
yes sir
wait he knows
on speakers
from a city? that doesn't make sense
right  now look: i want you all to be very careful this is terra incognita many customs will doubtless take us by surprise it's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extraterrestrial before
283 degrees 152 kilometers
everyone remember where we parked
nothing i should never have left him
uhura you did what was necessary  keep trying you'll find him
uhura where
mercy hospital
bearing 327 range 600 nautical
what?
put them on screen
on screen
sir estimating one nautical mile
mr scott  how soon?
out of control and blind as a bat
give me one more day sir the damage control is easy reading klingon is hard
appreciated by all mr scott  prepare for departure
about 60 feet admiral
that should be enough can you enclose it to hold water?
i suppose i can sir; are you planning to take a swim?
'knows i'm altering the coordinates let's jump to #12
humpbacked  people?
whales scotty 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece
admiral  how am i going to handle all that weight?
you'll work it out scotty and remember: two of them
two?
it takes two to tango mr scott
give me a round figure mr scott
oh twentyfour hours give or take staying cloaked after that admiral we'll be visible  and dead in the water in any case we won't have enough to break out of the earth's gravity to say nothing of getting back home
sorry sir we can't even do that in the 23rd century
sorry admiral we just thought you'll like to know we're beaming them now
in the kitchen
gary?
oh i see   tell them phasers on stun good luck kirk out
not good enough scotty you've got to do better
i'll try sir scott out  well now he's got himself in a bit of a snit don't he
mr sulu?
aye but i've never beamed up 400 tons before
how long scotty?
10 seconds admiral; 5  4  3  2  1
well done mr scott how soon can we be ready for warp speed?
i'll have to reenergize
don't take too long we're sitting ducks for their radar systems  mr sulu impulse climb
just do it
mr scott don't make jokes we are in danger of 
full power sir
mr sulu if you please
the beasties seem happy to see you doctor i hope you like our little aquarium
on my way
no power to the bay doors
the explosive override  ?
it's under water there's no way to reach it
go on ahead close the hatch
admiral you'll be trapped
in exchange for endowments they should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em
scotty don't prejudge a ship is a ship
thank you lt saavik
and here is a deposition i have made if it is not sufficient i will return to earth to testify
don't concern yourself saavik your leave has been granted for good and proper cause  how are you feeling?
i am well admiral
you will be in good hands here
yes admiral  sir i have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son  david died most bravely he saved spock he saved us all i thought you should know
klingon justice is a unique point of view mr president
vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the federation
your vessel did destroy uss grissom your men did kill kirk's son do you deny these events?
you do?
we deny nothing we have the right to preserve our race
do you have the right to murder?
millions?
i demand to see the owners i demand 
well that's different
if you'll follow me professor 
i will can my assistant come too?
of course
 yes?
i notice you're still working with polymers
i mean it's your life
sill? what else would i be working with?
ah what else indeed? let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18000 cubic feet of water?
that's easy: 6 inches we carry stuff that big in stock
yes i noticed now suppose  just suppose  i could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick would that be worth something to you eh?
 are you joking?
just use the keyboard
the keyboard how quaint
that's the ticket laddie
 but it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix
hi huey 205 isn't it?
you are naive look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years  not that i don't miss you
right on you fly?
oh here and there  i flew something similar in my academy days
all right then this is old stuff to you
old yes but interesting  do you mind if i ask a few questions?
i will be returning to vulcan within the hour i wanted to take my leave of you
it is kind of you to make this effort
it is not an effort you are my son  besides; i am most impressed with your performance in this  crises
most kind father
they are my friends
yes of course do you have any message for your mother?
just thought his work should go on
tell her i feel fine
gomen nasarei hito chigai de gozaranuka na  i'm sorry my son you have mis taken me for someone else
ah chigaau hito da hanashi kata ga okashii  yes this must be true you talk funny
sulu hikaru
ah sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira  ah then i am sure that you will have a long and happy life
arigato sayonara  thank you honorable sir
it's not our custom to have guests here at all let alone hold anyone against their will
your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures
if i were in your shoes i'd feel the same way after what happened  the 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew apparently he became ill
capability yes but where can warp drive take us except away from here?
he was on the verge of something too he was gonna show us the next day he said "the answer's not in the box it's in the band" know what it means?
why?
i don't like to leave questions unanswered
then you must spend your life answering questions
data if you were following the boy and discovered this ship
to move you off this planet you go to sleep one night in your village wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse a week later maybe a month you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it
i've been shot at thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all what's there to panic about?
we've just begun to  i suppose you're seventyfive
we've always known that to survive we had to remain apart it hasn't been easy many of the young people here want to know more about the offland they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life
most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down
but not you
it's only meaningful when you've got 40000 lines of code to back it up
there are days
you don't live up to your reputation as an offlander picard
in defense of offlanders there are many more like me
 who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? i don't think so
you give me more credit than i deserve of course i'm tempted who wouldn't be?  but some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one i'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes obviously some of us haven't
this is a school that's a student's work  she'll be ready to become an apprentice soon then in thirty or forty years she'll take her place among the artisans
an apprentice for thirty years  we've noticed your people's mental discipline did that develop here?
more questions always the explorer if you stay long enough that'll change
will it?
you'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday stop planning for tomorrow until you find  let me ask you a question  have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
man could he write code totally elegant he had his own style
a perfect moment?
when time seemed to stop and you could almost live in that moment
seeing my home planet from space for the first time
yes exactly nothing more complicated than perception  you explore the universe we've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself full of powerful forces most people aren't aware enough of the now to ever notice them
i wish i could spare a few centuries to learn
it took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn
i just haven't gotten around to it yet
 an offlander?
for someone so young
there are caves in those mountains
i'll make some for us
those really weird short lines
we can hold them off a long time once we get there  but they will not make it easy to get there
roughly translated: puberty although for a klingon that's not doing it justice  any severe mood swings unusual aggressive tendencies  be sure to let me know right away
by now the son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do
what's the rush?
i should warn you i've always been attracted to older women
this way
you've brought the federation into the middle of a blood feud admiral the children have returned to expel their elders just as they were once expelled except ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide
i thought it might begin the healing process
i'll be here
the "mighty" federation could learn a few things from this village
we'll come up with the next big thing
you're what?
i am better
i understand
i don't
i aspire to be more than i am
i know why  so people like us won't be afraid of you any more
perhaps that is true
my power cells continually re charge themselves
i can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine
really?
you wanna work  here?
really
for one thing your legs are shorter than everyone else's
but they are in a constant state of growth do you find it difficult to adapt?  a child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next i am surprised that you do not trip over your own feet
sometimes i do
my legs are eightysevenpoint two centimeters they were eightysevenpointtwo centimeters the day i was created they will be eighty sevenpointtwo centimeters the day i go off line my operation depends on specifications that do not change  i cannot imagine the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet
i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child
do machines ever play?
i play the violin and my chess routines are quite advanced
no i mean
for what purpose?
got out of my other commitment
because you're it and if you tag me then i'm it
but i can run much faster than you i am capable of exceeding fortyseven meters per second
data haven't you ever just played for fun?
androids don't havefun
why not?
no one's ever asked me that before
if you want to know 'what it's like to be a child' you need to learn how to play
tournel will take you the rest of the way
no i want to stay with you
it is safer there i will join you shortly
cool
bye
data doesn't breathe
won't he rust?
no
the artificial lifeform was right?
if not for data you'd probably have been relocated by now
and our people?
they all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production probably the result of the environmental anomalies here
are they in any danger?
not at all they're fine in fact they're better than fine increased metabolism high energy improved muscle tone we should all be so lucky
unlikely all 14 cameras are frozen do we call randy and phil? tell 'em there may have been a breakin?
very good doctor picard out
'yewcheen cheffaw' my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy
sure it is and your hair is still chestnut brown
your captain used to cut quite a rug
they should be quarantined before joining the ship's population
yes but look at this medscan
is it safe to move her?
safer than leaving her here
captain geordi?
you're aboard the enterprise
not yet 'love to bust my ass cause i'm not in frigging mensa  i swear to god it's that kid milo i told 'em so in the first place but they didn't even wanna hear about it  let's run a printout on card entries
what's the last thing you remember data
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl'
from the mission
i was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on ba'ku children my last memory is going into the hills following a boy
it's nothing personal data you have to remember these people have rejected technology and you
 i am the personification of everything they have rejected
until this week that young man probably never saw a  machine let alone one that walks and talks
and i do not believe i made a very good first impression
how about a passive radiation scan?
it is clearly federation in origin captain
keep looking
'just a few loose ends to tie up'
what you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields
what possible purpose could a duplicate village have except to deceive the ba'ku
i don't know
good let's begin to move these people out
another fortythree people reported taken sir
will the structure hold if we blast through?
i believe it is safe sir
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk
planet's population six hundred people you want to avoid unnecessary risks? next time leave your android home
what're we looking for?
another time
i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation
i know what data means to starfleet jeanluc but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet
he's right our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies
talk we should send down an assault team and take them by force
that is not an acceptable option if people get hurt all the support we have in the federation
federation support federation procedures federation rules look in the mirror admiral the federation is old in the last twenty four months it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant  the borg the cardassians the dominion they all smell the scent of death on the federation that's why you've embraced our offer because it will give your dear federation new life well how badly do you want it admiral? because there are hard choices to be made now if the enterprise gets through with news about their brave captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless ba'ku your federation politicians will waver your federation opinion polls will open a public debate your federation allies will want their say need i go on?
picard's first officer do you really believe he'll listen?
in six hours every living thing in this system will be dead or dying
it is not over
any irregularity in the pattern
it is over
if you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated the federation will pursue you until
 and now he's holding our people hostage down there
the enterprise can be at your position in two days admiral
that's probably not a good idea your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns
what kind of concerns?
we haven't fully identified the anomalies yet they're calling this whole area the briar patch it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you just get me data's schematics i'll keep you informed  dougherty out
this was too important for the enterprise to be on the sidelines admiral
i wish i had better news commander data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday ru'afo and i have decided to send in an assault team
sir commander worf and i have been working on several tactical plans to safely
i'll get my clothes
let's get him in here
understood
good luck dougherty out
you've done a terrific job jean luc now pack your bags and get the hell out of there how's data?
in stasis la forge is completing the diagnostic
i'll need all your paperwork tomorrow we're heading back your way set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out
you're not finished here?
just a few loose ends to tie up dougherty out
your "briar patch" turned out to be more hospitable than i expected
that's why we put chromodynamic shields in place  so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation
 or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world  i won't let you move them admiral i'll go to the federation council
they know 'just they don't trust me with it so we'll get the evidence first ask questions later
i'm acting on orders form the federation council
how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive?
the prime directive doesn't apply these people are not indigenous to this world they were never meant to be immortal we'll simply be restoring their natural evolution
who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
there are six hundred people down there we'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions  the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings
a planet in federation space
right we have the planet and they have the technology  a technology we can't duplicate you know what that makes us? their partners
our partners are nothing more than petty thugs
on earth petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire we can handle the son'a i'm not worried about that
someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago
i'm calling gary
with metaphasics lifespans will be doubled an entire new medical science will evolve  i understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life would you take his sight away from him?
there are metaphasic particles all over the briar patch why must this planet be
the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work don't ask me to explain it i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction after it's over the planet will be unlivable for generations
delay the procedure let my people look at the technology
our best scientific minds already have we can't find any other way to do this
then the son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do
it would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition some of them won't survive that long besides they don't want to live in the middle of the briar patch who would?
the ba'ku
we are only moving six hundred people jeanluc
how many people would it take before it becomes wrong? a thousand? fifty thousand a million?
where we going?
if a courtmartial is the only way to tell the people of the federation what happened here then i welcome it
there's nothing further to be gained from this
is this how a federation officer begs for his life?
i'm not begging for my life i'm begging for yours  there is still a way home gal'na
do you know how to disable the injector?
but i would need at least three minutes on the bridge
if we could lure him away from the bridge
it doesn't matter where he is as soon as he realizes something is happening he'll override my commands with one word at his com link
what if he doesn't realize something's happening  can you get me to a transmitter? i have to speak with worf and data on the surface we'll need their help
scan for lifesigns
i launched skywire just pray the last set of coordinates milo sent me connected us to gary's satellite
no sir but it wasn't easy being among them
i'm sure just don't forget what they did to us  we'll have them rounded up in a day or two we needn't bother with the federation holoship any more just get the holding cells ready
sir as the enterprise left orbit one of their support craft went down to the surface  it appeared to be the captain's yacht five persons on board
we're not waiting until morning take the shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight
recommendations?
we'd have to tag every one of them that would take time and we don't have it the enterprise is only nineteen hours from communications range with the federation
may i talk to you alone?
deploy the collector
no one hated them more than you gal'na  we've come a long way together this is the moment we've planned for so many years
the shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction
you know my name
thankyou for reminding me
they are in opposite directions sir
are they?
do you have everything you need from command?
when i was an ensign i could detect a threemicron mis alignment
do you know how they were damaged?
by a son'a weapon  there's no doubt about it sir that's what made data malfunction
the son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned
i don't believe it happened that way
why would they fire at him without provocation?
you know mine
all i know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot then his failsafe system was activated
failsafe?
his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions
so you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong
in a sense that's all he knew the system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss
and yet he attacked us and told the ba'ku we were a threat
it's nothing i'm just tired
 had regenerated
it may not last after we leave if not i just wanted before we go  i've never actually seen a sunrise
i think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone
you're famous around here
the manifold can't handle full impulse in the patch commander
if we don't outrun them the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship
i'll be in engineering
you got me commander
that's your expert opinion?
detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade but then again it might not subspace weapons are unpredictable that's why they were banned
options?
eject the core
negative i want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can
the purpose being?
i'm getting a teacher's pet rep
if it works you mean
even if it doesn't they'll be teaching kids as the academy not to do this for years to come
why not?
on screen
eject the core
commander if one of their weapons hits that gas
it's our only way out of here mister nara
how long 'til they reach us?
eighteen minutes
cometary debris pockets of unstable metreon gas we don't want to go in there sir
i wouldn't worry about it you've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets
yes we do  you're relieved ensign take over at ops
remind me to lodge a protest
we're through running from these bastards
blow out the ramscoop stand by full thrusters
we can't delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two it would put us into the middle of monsoon season
the diplomatic corps is busy with dominion negotiations
 so they need us to put out one more brush fire  anyone remember when we used to be explorers?
deck ten
commander riker
we won't be able to go any faster than onethird impulse in that muck
it's shakespeare  maybe you've heard of him?
pouring it out
were you?
nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey
so where are the 'environmental concerns' the admiral was talking about?
the only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region
we're not going anywhere
you klingons never do anything small do you
aye sir
go back to your quarters  that's an order
fat chance i'll post it on every monitor on the ship
top level review my ass there'll be no coverup of this not after i get
jeanluc picard my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi
we moved around so much i barely knew my teachers
would you like something to eat?
no we're here to rescue them
as you wish but i would ask you to disarm yourselves this village is a sanctuary of life
you've not aged a day since then?
actually i was a good deal older when we arrived in terms of my physical condition
ask them
i'm afraid there's too much bitterness on both sides
slow to impulse we're on our way
we'll skip the court martial this time picard out
yes yes i can hear you
me too were you an army brat or something?
we're trying to get to you sir
we're coming as fast as we can we can't risk using phasers
i understand tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready
worf what the hell are you doing here?
it's good to have you back worf  slow to onethird take us in
transmit a wide band covariant signal that'll get his attention
he might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach
the metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux steer clear of them mister worf
sir?
hmm? oh it's just something my mother used to
something like that yeah
make it so
beam him out
prepare to enter the atmosphere we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him
evasive maneuvers heading one fourzero mark threeone
no sir i haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since i've been back
they're composers worf from the nineteenth century data was rehearsing a part in hms pinafore before he left  "a british tar is a soaring soul as free as a mountain bird his energetic first should be ready to resist a dictatorial word"
i'm not letting go of him
transferring controls to manual
no sir
debrief them again  have you been in a fight commander?
didn't mean to pry i just have this theory some of us who got to good at this? we were  escaping something
no sir it is a gorch
gorch?
picard to crusher
no we'll be responsible for that mister worf
accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jak'tahla
very well we'll take an hour break out some rations
we have to find shelter
decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam mister worf
can you beam him off?
negative he's established a security field around the control room
no i know what you mean i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers least they make sense sometimes you think they've betrayed you like a person would but then you see no you just missed a step you can go back and make it all work
is there any other way to disable the injector?
say the greeting again
yewcheen cheffaw emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'
better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette something that goes well with chrysanthemums
you have two days to become experts mister worf your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture data
they have an incredible clarity of perception captain i've never encountered a species with such mental discipline
why was data assigned?
"environmental concerns" again an android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind
what are they interested in?
wine women and song
graphical interfaces for skywire? i'm s'posed to coordinate with you
you should feel right at home with them
hmm i should feel right at home with them
you're in luck it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants
good question
what?
what you're doing to my neck
was i doing something to your neck?
no children?
if that's true they're a dying race
got a minute? i need a little counseling  first time for everything do i lie down or what?
show me
whatever makes you comfortable
but it's comfortable
why don't you try sitting up?
or you could try lying down
you're in quite a mood today
 i believe you
 i'm not sleeping well
 doctor crusher has something that'll take care of that
on this ship anything can happen and usually does
augh?
yeah? i ran it for lots of platforms ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to 
i never kissed you with a beard before
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
activating injector assembly
sir i am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels
your scanners must be malfunctioning
all ship functions are offline
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here
isolate one and reroute its command sequence through the auxiliary processor
absolutely
good hunting hayes out
no please
mister data set a pursuit course maximum warp
it's been destroyed the borg threat is over  are you all right? the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment
we're fine sir it will take some time to explain
i look forward to reading your report
montana? well that answers everything why the hell are we 
we're here to find zephram cochrane he may be injured or dead
cochrane the inventor of warp drive?
yes
but he's been dead for three hundred  oh god we've gone back in time again haven't we?
i'm afraid so if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans earth will remain in the second dark age an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century
do you really want me to forget about you?
"there is no second place" plus every time i get jammedup gary has an inspiration  is it like that with your counselor?
well why didn't you just say so in the first place?
i've stabilized him for now but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy i want to take him to the ship
jeanluc this man needs medical attention now
as i recall the town of resurrection is about two kilometers east of here they might have a hospital
it may not be that simple this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history
are you saying they won't help us?
i'm saying they might shoot us on sight you have to remember these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them
there must be some good people even in this time
let's hope so because if cochrane dies the future may die with him
yes but until then you'll have to make do with what you've got
mine's not the ceo he barely remembers to take a shower
that'll be interesting
i'll be fine  he's a different story
it was an experience metal scalpels needle and thread
how did doctor almack react to that?
he was so confused by what i was doing i don't think he even noticed  any word from the enterprise?
not yet
you think they're still up there?
if they're not we'd better get used to living in montana
that might not be so bad at least for you
you want some advice? don't do this again  you know exactly what i mean
right right but does he ever just like hand you code?
beverly there were many reasons why you and i
i'd call them excuses and the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty" we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else and you know what? it's not
at least four hours
um yeah  now he's going to need a respirator do you have one?
we have two but we don't have the juice to run them
bag him
i'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments if they move any closer to the brain we could be looking at a hemorrhage
intelligence ambition desire i bring order to chaos
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference
i do not know what you are referring to
maybe once i rewrote it anyway
that's because you haven't been properly stimulated yet
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure
what a cold description for such a beautiful gift
they're not your friends they've held you back kept you from your destiny
that is not true they have tried to help me
have they given you what i have given you? did they even try?
i do not want this
i wish to go back to the way i was
more lies
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things
you're compulsive
i'm your creator now
a universe of sensation is waiting for you don't you want to explore it with me?
then take the final step give me the enterprise and we can be together always
no no please you cannot
yes but the enterprise my duty
 is to yourself don't make me hurt you again
and i need to control this ship let me into your mind
vulcan?
no
the problem must lie in the interface between starfleet and borg technology your console may not be configured to handle the data flow
mmmmore like  i have a little trouble trusting people
can you configure it?
i believe so
do it
bring us about target borg ship alpha four port side battery
ready quantum torpedo
go to impulse where's the borg ship?
it has entered earth orbit  correction  it is not in orbit it is heading directly toward the surface
what?
where's the sphere?
contact starfleet command
why's that?
according to our astrometric readings the year is 2063
today is march second 2063 the time in montana is oheightforty five
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before as an android i am in complete control of my neural net the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed
you are an imperfect being created by an imperfect being finding your weakness is only a matter of time
i am the borg
that is a contradiction the borg act as a collective consciousness there are no individuals
i am the beginning the end i am the one who is many i am the borg
but how?
not very well we met shortly after the enterprisee was commissioned i found her to be a most promising officer
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming grief loss remorse
long story not that interesting
we still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done
i will admit there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off
doctor crusher has been studying some advanced medical theories
power there hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks most of the batteries are depleted
i told you there's no 
where?
outside around back next to the water tank
oh just a little tinkering how is he?
understood keep me informed
let's go
then and now  but not right now
how serious is the damage?
i'm having trouble scanning underground there's a lot of radiation leaking from something
probably from the nuclear warhead cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive
there should be an access hatch nearby
i have the password right here
there should be some kind of manual release
it could be the radiation captain try from the surface
can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
yeah if i knew what it looked like there's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours  there must be some design schematics blueprints
she saved my life
we're tearing this place apart looking for them but the computers are down and the fires destroyed half the filesso far nothing
if there are other photographs i think i may know how to find them
they used copper pipes in their plumbing so i melted it down and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings  it's not the strongest alloy but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel
always am
phoenix to control  initiating five minute countdown mark
tell her to go back to resurrection
she's a very determined woman  phoenix to control mister lange let her in
this is picard i've suspended the launch sequence
it'll have to wait come on
then we'll just have to assume it's still there
i don't want to drag you down with me
why would you do a thing like 
what's still there?
get a tricorder you're going to have to track my exact position in that room
altitude fifty kilometers
entering the upper ionospere
there's a red light on the second intake valve
ignore it we'll be fine  prepare for first stage shutdown and separation on my mark
as they used to say all systems are go
bring the warp core online i'll lay in a heading
the nacelles are charged nuclear warhead standing by we're ready to ignite the warp drive
<u>engage</u>
you thought about it too you've been suspicious for a while but it's not happening in there it's happening in the day care
i'm on it
speed  two hundred seventyfive thousand kilometers per second
one minute to warp threshold
picard to enterprise  picard to enterprise  do you read me?
well i feel a whole lot better with them out there we may need some help
we're crossing the threshold
it'll be tight but we should make it
what about our warp signature? it has to be strong enough for them to detect
i've enhanced the plasma injectors  don't worry they'll see it
well with any luck the vulcans will land outside resurrection tomorrow morning and earth will never be the same again
the day care?
active
main bus
ready
initiate preignition sequence
lieutenant actually lieutenant jonathan scrimm i'm the head of the resurrection protective force  and you are?
jeanluc picard
great name french?
yes
you don't sound french
oh here and there you know how it is
but why would they ?
not really i was born and raised right here never had much use for travel
california san francisco
beautiful city used to be anyway i didn't think anyone still lived there
there's a few of us left
it wasn't a trick i used to be an electrical engineer
huh
i'm an old friend of cochrane's i wanted to see how he was doing
lucky for him you came by when you did he might be dead now
yes
maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo we heard some explosions out there this morning
you know there is no second place and what's the risk? the killings're undetectable they're handtailored they make "sense" i mean they're in the information business they have scenarios for all of us too in case we find out too much
i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine and one of the fuel cells burst
something wrong with that?
not yet
the invasion plans
invasion
these people you're calling "vulcans" who are they? where do they come from? how many troops? what kind of weapons?
wrong answer mister picard try again
and you know all this because <u>you're</u> a spaceman too
i'm afraid you've caught me i am a spaceman
yes he is
oh yeah?
ah yes but i didn't realize that 
thank god this plate was already fixed
yes and i only had enough silver halide for one shot so you're lucky you didn't screw it up
i'm very sorry
yes i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo there were three of them printed on some kind of fabric
bed sheets  i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints not the best material but i haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years
did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
i can try
you'd have to try real hard no one's used currency in over ten years what are you from another planet?
trade okay the photographs for a straight answer  who are you? and how do you know zephram?
they'd frame him
i'm an old friend i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in 
'fraid not
you're lying
what makes you say that?
you're not someone who lies very easily so it's obvious when you do at least to me
are you always sucha good judge of character?
no not like you and doctor crusher used to be
how did you know about that?
i'm sure it is but it'll have to wait until tomorrow
it can't wait until tomorrow
he's out of prison?
too bad  besides it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies
don't flatter yourself i take pictures of a lot of junk
we're trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship it's been damaged and 
we?
myself and a few other friends of zephram's
friends from cornell
some
lie that's one keep going
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like
all right truth i believe that one why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
they're already watching you if they had to they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout he'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge"
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon
or?
and all i'm asking for is the truth that would take five minutes  for all i know you caused the explosions at the silo and now you're trying to steal zephram's ship
i am not a thief
i have to
where? and don't tell me san francisco
no it's a lot further than that
it's the future isn't it? just like you told scrimm  i knew you weren't from around here
no i'm from france
i don't care if you're from france or venus just take me with you
hmm?
that's impossible
why?
this may be hard for you to understand but i'm dutybound not to interfere with you or anyone else here any more than is absolutely necessary
you've been interfering with my life ever since i met you  don't stop now
aye sir

we have to follow them back repair whatever damage they've done to that timeline
western hemisphere north american continent
fire
daphne i
i always felt if a  boy i liked ever found out  he'd run he'd think i was unclean
aye sir
data set a course for that vortex
steady as she goes
intercept course full impulse  weapons status?
phasers are offline we have two quantum torpedoes left but the computer targeting system has been destroyed
go to manual
fire
aye sir
onscreen
worf torpedo now
no no never
they did it they assimilated earth
we're still in earth orbit
on screen
life signs?
can't tell longrange bio sensors are offline
in twentyfour hours zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test from a missile silo in montana if i'm right the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship
and if they succeed humans won't make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow  as first officer i should be the one beaming down
normally i would agree but in this case the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history you're many things number one but you're not much of an historian
i'll keep in contact you have the bridge
yes sir
they've got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person it's over
then make it so have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
unless you'd like to stay
no sir
incoming message from the starship intrepid admiral hayes
assign another team if you need to i want to reestablish communication with the captain as soon as possible
what?
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room
we'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the collective
we have to cover both possibilities  we'll take care of the bridge worf take your men and seal off main engineering turn it into a fortress  nothing gets in
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish
who can we trust?
computer  thermal enhancement
they're converting the deflector dish into an antennae
agreed options?
destroy the deflector dish
i guess i'd better get it right the first time
the borg will undoubtedly attack set phasers to rotating modulation
just a little queasy
try not to look at the stars keep your eyes on the ship
right
and commander whatever you do do <u>not</u> vomit in your exosuit it would be unpleasant
there's always a logical answer  you just have to define the question
i'll keep that in mind
understood
we've lost bridge control
emergency override
nothing
we just lost main power and we've got classthree alerts all over the ship i'm not sure what's 
the borg  some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship  seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields
wil data was down there
mister worf find data if you can but your top priority is isolating the borg
do we have any idea how many borg we're dealing with?
there're so many disinformation sites about gary already where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein
where the hell are they going?
deflector dish why the deflector dish?
what are you suggesting?
i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll
hold that thought
riker here
there's a dampening field in place on this deck our tricorders are useless
any sign of data or the borg themselves?
something is very wrong commander we're falling back
commander we have a problem
right but gary's tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick
captain i've scanned the planet the atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane carbon monoxide and fluorine the oceans have been chemically altered as well
target
there were no planetary defense systems in this era their weapons were designed to fight each other not extraterrestrials
data's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise command codes security protocols
what kind of message?
admiral donaldbill
mr president we cannot allow federation citizens to be abducted
at present i'm awaiting a full report from enterprise pending that i am constrained to observe interstellar law
the longer we wait the less accessible the hostages will be mr president
i'll bear it in mind admiral i think that's all
we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home
i'm going too they may need a doctor
the charge is murder
you may need assistance doctor
fascinating
vulcans sleep lying down
we do sleep lying down
thank you nurse jim she's ready lock and load
we were beginning to hit our stride together doctor
that's the question 
you heard the order lieutenant
certainly not at my happy home
i wish i knew uhura?
can you  ?
jim i don't even know his anatomy
chancellor gorkon can you hear me? chancellor?
what's the brotherhood of aliens?
we've been set up all along
suppose he's holding a grudge?
we're not finished
speak for yourself one day one night
bones are you afraid of the future?
what about "60 minutes"
that was the general idea i intended to convey
i didn't mean this future
are we playing multiple choice?
some people are afraid of the future; of what might happen;  i was frightened really frightened
specifically of?
no more neutral zone i was used to hating klingons that's why i failed in our assignment  it never even occurred to me to take gorkon at his word spock was right
well don't be too hard on yourself  we all felt exactly the same 
uh uh somebody felt much worse and i'm starting to understand why
well if you've got any bright ideas now's the time to 
still think we're finished?
c'mon start at the beginning  you know these people?
yeah they dig stuff like this  "cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of 2001"
more than ever
don't remind me
no way  you see this?
that cunning little vulcan
once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away
if they're even looking for us
spock's looking for us
she didn't need our help getting anywhere where did she get these convenient clothes? and don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue
killed trying to escape  it's a classic
come on
but still you can't say cbs wouldn't love to break something like 
and the good news is they're not going to prosecute
to be 
and perhaps with a large step or two like a peace treaty
starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"
now there's a poser
captain shall we attempt to return fire?
in space no one can hear you sweat
if they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in how can we rely on them?
we were until your torpedoes
then let me help
say there's just one "mole" working there like barton at the doj how do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? or she? or the guy she works for?
aside from a touch of arthritis i'd say pretty good
stand?
retire
ah i believe you also consumed romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question doctor?
barely
have you saved patients as "barely" alive as he was?
you say you are due for retirement may i ask: do your hands shake?
you were incompetent  whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine
i tried to save him i was desperate to save him he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace
the chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook
timewarner has a 40 per cent stake in gary's settop device that also takes out cnn  "ge joins outpost in new venture" which means nbc is out "disney joins outpost" abc is out "outpost and newscorp in new deal" fox is out any of these places could have a mole or all of 'em  it's like a a continuous loop we can go to some alternative press place that 1000 people read get them and us killed but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something gary's got a finger in
they'll make it look like an accident
what are you in for if you don't mind me asking?
i don't mind smuggling guilty i come from arc smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there
that's a comfort
i don't wonder stop me if i'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
i thought i would assume a pleasing shape  we're outside the shield now it's your turn kirk
i'm not sure how to take that
very much
i beg your pardon?
you feign ignorance?
what?
what happened?
you crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit and two starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this we have witnesses
how can i trust 
he just tried to save him
take them away
isn't it a fact that you served romulan ale a beverage illegal in the federation because of its overwhelming potency?
the drink was served
there were no other ships in the sector
did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
i checked the data banks yes
he's got 12 satellites up he's got dishes on top of 21 he's building this   meganetwork for skywire let's use it
and what did they tell you?
that we fired two photon torpedoes but 
that isn't true
that either as an instrument of federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative you and your fellow conspirators crippled kronos one and coldbloodedly assassinated the chancellor of the high council then you and doctor mccoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete
yes
spoken by you?
yes
louder please we cannot hear you
those words were spoken by me
yes
a what?
for insubordination
i have on occasion disobeyed orders
and you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of chancellor gorkon?
well i 
you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor?
i cannot confirm or deny actions which i did not witness
captain kirk are you aware that under federation law the captain of a starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
i am
so if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination  ?
your honors the state rests
it's how online services push logos they wanna sell you you don't ask for 'em they just appear 'have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house and then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital that's 12 months away
captain sulu on assignment anyone seen spock?
full diplomatic courtesy mr chekov
i know what you mean
uhura monitor
torpedo bay did we fire those torpedoes?
first rule of assassination: always kill the assassins
who else?
she's only a cog in the wheel  no way she knows that
but if she's cloaked
then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge  and by the time we're close enough to record it we're ashes
but they'd still get the idea right?
shields up battle stations
aye sir; thrusters
aye sir; thrusters
second star to the right  and straight on till morning
shields up captain ?
what are we searching for mr spock?
you tell them lieutenant
they must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here
this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory
now we go to starfleet?
you'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop maybe some audio too to tie it all in to gary how long would that take you?
now we expand our search to include uniforms
all uniforms?
quite right mr chekov what is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain  and a degree of intrepidity before the captain and doctor mccoy freeze to death
she programmed the torpedo hits?
mr valtane any more data?
onscreen
do we report this sir?
are you kidding?  send to starfleet command
is that wise sir? i mean given their situation   aye sir
chancellor we've been ordered to escort you through federation space to your meeting place on earth
tamina was a friend of mine  my shower was broken she let me use theirs
it's a standard gui once i've got a concept it's maybe three day's work
thank you captain
uh would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard enterprise with my officers as guests of the united federation of planets?
we'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours
i shall look forward to it
commander face to face at last you have my thanks
starfleet's been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors
this cannot be easy for you captain  i would feel awkward if i had to give you a tour of our vessel
we must do this again soon
give a girl a chance captain
good enough for one  two would look suspicious killed while attempting escape now that's convincing for both
gary knows i'm close on skywire we have to do this fast
they'll be here
i like it here
kill him he's the one
not me idiot  him
he's got it
and your coat
fraid not it wouldn't fit him anyway
krandog aranty
there's a reward for your death
we didn't kill gorkon
before they kill somebody else too
of course not anyway somebody up there wants you out of the way
don't you know? everyone on rura penthe is here for life
anything else you want to tell me?
there's gotta be a way out of this place
except us
it is possible
where do we come in?
getting outside the shield is easy after that it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze can you?
possibly
i can't make it alone you're the likeliest candidate to come to this godforsaken place in months
oh man i'd have to get into gary's house to get the satellite positions
candidate for what?
energize
captain if 
stand down mr scott all stop that's an order
aye sir
who else?
saavik sir we were told you'd need a helmsman    so i volunteered
thank you lieutenant one quarter impulse power
captain may i remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock?
plot a course for kronos lieutenant
you mean  break in?
kronos sir?
i'm still in the chair lieutenant
aye sir
come on saavik you could knock 
we're almost at the rendezvous  i thought you'd want to know
right 
you piloted well out of spacedock lieutenant 
i always wanted to try that
only don't try putting words in my mouth
right standard rudder z plus five degrees
i don't know 
captain
sir?
mr chekov anything unusual?
uhura signal our surrender
i won't allow starfleet to be dismantled over some klingon promises
starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a court martial on this ship lieutenant win lose or draw it will be on your record
you hear that?
sulu
standing by captain kirk
you understand that by even talking to us you're violating regulations captain
and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? you said the place isn't finished
i'm sorry captain  your message is breaking up
bless you sulu  where's the peace conference? they're going to attempt another assassination
the conference is at camp khitomer near the romulan border i'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency
i'm afraid we may need more than that there's a bird of prey on the lookout for us and she can fire while she's cloaked
surely not
i'm telling you hang on  how many of those things are there? come on lieutenant you're charged with murder
when does this conference start?
according to my information today
thank you captain sulu
don't mention it captain kirk
i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally?
we have volunteered to rendezvous with the klingon ship that's bringing chancellor gorkon here and escort him safely through federation space
you have personally 
there's an old vulcan proverb: only nixon could go to china
how could you vouch for me? that's   arrogant presumption 
i was asked by my father to open neg
i know your father's the vulcan ambassador for heaven's sake but you know how i feel about this: they're animals
jim there is an historic opportunity here 
don't trust them don't believe them 
they're dying
let them die
oh  i liked you i was checking you out
congratulations lieutenant that must make you very proud
the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal
far be it for me to dispute my first officer starfleet has always 
i'm going to sleep it off let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight
i am uncertain
spock i'm really tired
we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation
where?
curiously it appears to emanate from us
from enterprise?
'cause their apartments might be bugged?
we've fired on the chancellor's ship 
according to the data bank we have  twice
i'm going you are going to be responsible for getting me out of this meantime we're not going to be the instigators of a fullscale war on the eve of universal peace
perhaps you're right
he was just about to explain the whole damn 
so that's it
what peace conference?
azetbur has agreed to meet the federation at a undisclosed location to continue her father's work the conspirators obviously intend to try again
why would they give them to us?
the commander is an old friend of yours
go on
what'd he say?
you were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation you might have died
the night is young anyway it was logical  you know you're a great one for logic i'm a great one for  rushing in where angels fear to tread we're both extremists reality is probably somewhere in between us
i too was blind i knew about her  and i did nothing i trusted too much
you couldn't have known she was listening the night i dictated that entry into my log you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan
i was prejuduced by those achievements
gorkon had to die before i understood how prejudiced i was
someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "s" you haven't outlived your usefulness  to me and you are not responsible just because she is also vulcan 
i should have been 
not for the actions of another no one is responsible for any actions but his own human beings 
but i am not human i am only 
"a beautiful geek? what're the chances?"
spock you want to know something?
not yet section 4236
make ourselves a target?
probably trying to figure out why we're reversing wondering if we detect her
i always assumed hamlet meant death
gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else  another kin of life people can be very frightened of change i know i was
 is to trust him
control this is enterprise requesting permission to depart
this is the starship enterprise captain james kirk commanding
we surrender
gary
this is enterprise we surrender repeat  enterprise surrenders 
i'm going aboard spock you have the conn
who else?
nothing captain if they're here they're rigger for silent running
not from a distance she won't show up on any type of scan
sir i speak to you as a kindred intellect do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the federation?
i am not certain such speculations are included among your duties lieutenant
faith?
that the universe will unfold as it should
what do you suggest lieutenant? opening fire won't retrieve the captain; and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid
the dishes are juiced up too
in the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight according to our data banks this ship fired those torpedoes
such things have happened before sir
not as yet sir
curious you haven't been assisting commander uhura with her radio transmissions have you lt?
commander uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir
very well for twentyfour hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place
a lie?
an omission after that 
we've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out  but the killers may be among them surely they've disposed of these boots by now wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on gorkon's ship?
even logic must give way to physics gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped without their boots they would not have stayed on the klingon transporter pads
thank god
i'm having the garbage searched if my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers' necks like tiberian bats they couldn't make their escape without them; nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see; no  they're here somewhere
an error
i don't want to
i believe you please
you can't prove any of this
you've betrayed the federation  all of you
confirmed captain
we've been ordered to 
in nineteenth century france workers who felt their livelihood threatened by machines flung their wooden shoes  called sabots  into the gears to stop them hence the word sabotage
we are experiencing a technical malfunction all backup systems inoperative
milo? shrot suspects somebody broke into #21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts
i do not think so enterprise has disobeyed orders and harbors two escaped convicts admiral donald will make certain all your shipto shore transmissions are jammed
what?
apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock sir
signal starfleet that we have no idea location of enterprise
sir?
you having hearing problems mister?
no sir
fiftyfour planets  and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies our sensing and analytic equipment worked well
then it's time we were heading home three years is
visual
they know i broke in alice helped me  shrot's not one of them he's blundering into this on his own
negative the subspace shockwave originated at bearing threetwo three mark sevenfive the location is  praxis a klingon moon barren of indigenous life forms but 
essential as a resource praxis is their key energy production facility  send to klingon high command: "this is excelsior a federation starship traveling through beta quadrant we have monitored a large explosion in your sector do <u>you require assistance</u>?"
what is it?
 i cannot confirm the existence of praxis
what's left of it
i've already addressed that question mr scott we'll e able to follow the captain's movements
mr scott you forget yourself please accompany me
yet the data banks insist we fired: twice one computer is lying
a computer canna lie sir
i think  not
he doesn't know about the day care
you can check the torpedoes visually if you like 
we'll have to check every one of them mr scott
that could take hours
nevertheless
and if they're still in place?
then someone forged a data bank entry
that's hardly conclusive mr scott as klingons have no tear ducts
i know precisely where he'll be
there was an enormous neutron energy surge
not from us
hardly anybody does that's the beauty part no cameras the doj doesn't bother with it it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about you know the best place to hide a leaf?
if another ship had been beneath us the klingons would've seen her
would they?
this one can
they you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr spock
i believe i am
thank you mr scott we were to return to spacedock the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear
aye aye sir
how do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
yes sir
he's placing himself in a most awkward position
yeah that's old in a tree
what exactly does that mean?
it means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did
even assuming you're correct mr spock why would they fire on their own president?
i want this ship searched from bow to stern lieutenant saavik you are in charge start with the transporter room and work your way outwards
mr scott any progress on repairing our warp drive?
at present he's surrounded by a magnetic shield if my calculations are correct he should be deep into his escape planning by this time
maybe we should write them a letter?
well what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
but you didn't join a conspiracy
i was taken from my homeworld by people called the "pakjeds" they are fat they traded me to a ship belonging to the "bolians" the "bolians" are blue they put me in a seat and asked me questions then they were attacked by another ship
if i tell you will you arrest me?
oh
yes please continue
you are me
no my name is data i am your brother
i am in a room with lights
no
no
is that your final answer?
no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines
why?
because you are dangerous
milo? what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four am? and tells them about it?
why?
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship
i do not understand
i know
no
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
no can i move now?
no i must deactivate you
for how long?
indefinitely
perfect  how am i gonna get away from the party long enough to 
how long is that?
please beverly this is hard enough
about twentyfive years ago they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell
understood keep on it i need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat give me options
you're working late
he was a bit proud as i recall
he was a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of seasoning
he turned out all right
is he very much like you were?
yes
you could always say you have to go the bathroom
i wish i could believe that doctor
can you describe it deanna?
but the romulans abandoned the plan
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age he was engineered to skip thirty years of life but since the rna sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down he's dying
dying?
i can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating
i'm counting on it we've been ordered to head to sector 3274 starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there
how far we've come let me know if you need anything
reminds me of a young doctor i used to know
they're running me ragged nothing but question day and night i love it come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it there's a bajoran band at the officer's mess
that's lame isn't it?
not tonight i have work here
to happy endings
i understand why it would seem confusing certain human rituals like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan?
will and deanna joining the titan dr crusher going to starfleet medical
and this makes you "sad"?
well i suppose it does a bit i'm very happy for them of course but i'm going to miss them the ship will seem incomplete without them
that is because you have a familiarity with them you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge
yes and frankly i envy them as well they've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them new worlds to conquer
you never know what's over the horizon data before too long you'll be offered a command of your own
you'll come up with something
now you make a toast
to new worlds
new worlds yes data brave new worlds
thank you data  let's see what she can do
mister worf accompany data please
i can see that
sorry sir
well it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown keep at it anything you can give me would be appreciated dismissed
on my way
good work the download?
he suspects i know something i think he was sort of  explaining himself to me in case i do  we have to go in tonight i'm two hours from a beta version  but i've gotta go home for an hour
he believes he has our communications protocols but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels
aye sir this way
it would appear so
it'll only work for one of us
yes sir
we'll find a way off together recommendations?
there is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location
they are trying to override the access codes reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and
while i find that fascinating data we really need that goddamned door open
port thrusters sir would you like me to drive?
why?
affirmative sir negative sir they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals
well then only one way to go
we're about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark
ready captain
fire
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes
of you?
yes
i do not agree although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual
but so much is the same on a biological level he is and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him
she called to apologize i said i was pulling an allnighter she said then come home just to say hi which i always do when we fight it's suspicious if i don't
he would deny a "human" connection is possible he considers himself entirely reman
he may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
no sir it is not possible the b9 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced but even if they were he would not be me
how can you be sure?
i aspire sir to be better than i am the b9 does not nor does shinzon
it's interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography?
yes sir the rift effects all longrange communications
commander riker evasive maneuvers
full axis rotation to port fire all ventral phasers
divert power and compensate
please don't go
deanna stand by  open a channel
negative
sir
you are not looking at your self you are looking at me
you do not look like me
this is not an appropriate time for a conversation
why?
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle
why?
how many of you did dr soong make?
arrest you for what?  why would we arrest you?
at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary
i thought only me myself and lore
captain i don't recommend transporting that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly it could head this way with out much warning 
i can't believe the captain went along with a memory download
captain picard agrees that the b9 was probably designed with the same selfactualization parameters as myself if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities
he'd have all your memories too you feel comfortable with that?
i feel nothing geordi it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual
an individual more like you you mean
yes
maybe he's not supposed to be like you maybe he's supposed to be just like he is
it seems to be a redundant memory port  maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
tell me you're not calling on your car phone?
dr soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions
it's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics?
no i do not mind
don't give up hope data i know i know you're not capable of hope
i am not
emergency force fields are holding

why is it moving?
like me it has been designed with modular power sources
the resemblance is striking
it's three years old it 
i would like to pick you up now may i do that?
thank you
the hell you will you know too much about me as it is  now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on betazed
with pleasure captain
do you have a moment sir?
of course sit down
you're speaking of emotional investment?
the b9 is like a slow child sir and data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian i'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences he'll be disappointed when the bi9 cannot meet those expectations
as much as we care for him deanna we have to remember that data isn't capable of disappointment
and i you
bring it to the other location
is he sincere about wanting peace?
i don't know
how could i not?
captain don't assume he's anything like you are you should resist the urge to think you know him
i not only know him deanna i am him and he is me
permission denied if you can possibly endure any more of these assaults  i need you at my side now more than ever i
i know how he thinks
counselor?
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me
make it so
but you said the other 
this isn't about me anymore
deanna troi of betazed empathic and telepathic abilities ship's counselor all of this i knew but i didn't know you were so beautiful
no
this isn't real
can you feel my hands are they real? can you feel my lips my loins?
you sick bastard
very logical deanna but your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic  to leave all of this behind and be with me
i can feel your desire deanna
your timing is impeccable commander
the empire considers this a matter of internal security we regret you've become involved
let's try #2
when this is over i owe you a drink
do you have life support?

understood
this is commander donatra of the valdore we're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies
thank you commander
what do we know about the planet?
uncharted we'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan
theories?
what do we know about the population?
what?
then how did a reman get to be praetor? i don't get it
what programs were accessed?
that's what i don't get  it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations it's not even restricted material
set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting if it happens again we want to be ready
there's something else i was reviewing the sensor logs
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up but he's got it captain
as i remember thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its bioqenic properties
and that's exactly what he's going to do
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
he wants to look me in the eye
he's been altering the coordinates since we logged on he's a step ahead let's jump to #12
sir?
aye sir
deanna on my mark
ready sir
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes
aye sir
on screen
i'll take care of it sir
number one  you have the bridge

wait a second he knows i know
with or without the rest of the fleet?
a diplomatic mission we've been invited believe it or not seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup the new praetor someone called shinzon has requested a federation envoy
new praetor?
there's more as always he's reman
understood

not with the romulans

just lucky admiral
let's hope that luck holds janeway out
and your phone messages you wanna do what you do it's not a crime
praetor shinzon i'm pleased to
i am not shinzon i am his viceroy we are sending transport coordinates
what are you doing to counsellor troi?
i'm preparing her for shinzon to sooth him as she soothes you to stand at his side as she does at yours
that will never happen
listen to him android such a small and weak creature yet he roars so valiantly
there'll be another after me and another after that you'll find we're a resilient species
i look forward to the sport  take him
come now a big strapping fellow like you? what are you afraid of?
what sort of signature?
no no don't talk to immigration
is that how larry feels?
if you don't mind
not yet mister worf
captain
tactical analysis mister worf
fiftytwo disruptor banks twentyseven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields
on screen
who was it?
aye sir
on screen
aye sir
uh not exactly
on my way please notify commander riker
your new chair sir
still well on our side
thank you sir
i appreciate your concern number one but i've been itching to try out the argo
sir 
captain's prerogative will there's no foreseeable danger and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you
acknowledged   i'll talk to data
a coup d'etat?
the praetor's power has always been the romulan fleet they must be behind him
hey we got seed money for the startup a millionfive
it's an old psychological strategy number one to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy
it's working
counselor?
patience diplomacy is a very exacting occupation we can wait
she's a predator
away team transporter room four
can anything be done for him?
his hatred of the federation is apparent he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason he is going after earth
oh boy destroy humanity and the federation is crippled
and the romulans invade
outpost made me sign 1000 'guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about life stuff
we can only hope so
he's firing through his cloak we can't get a lock
unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark
agreed
i promise you in time she'll become your home if i could offer you one piece of advice?
anything
when your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions ignore him
i intend to
the honor was mine captain riker
praetor shinzon?
what?
no?
i've never met a human woman
praetor we've come to romulus on a matter we were  assured was of great importance if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation i suggest you do so now
i would be interested to know what we are talking about
unity captain tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people federation and romulan human and vulcan and klingon and reman i'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same we want peace
and the senate supports you?
i have dissolved the senate
and you're wondering why the scimitar is so well armed is this the ship of a peacemaker? or a predator?
yes
then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion computer raise lighting four levels
jesus teddy
you know i do
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow just the two of us or just the one of us
you know i need to verify this
i know
what happened?
as happens so frequently here on romulus a new government came to power they decided to abandon the plan  frankly i think they were afraid i'd be discovered and it would lead to war they weren't ready for that
you'll acquire a taste for it
not quite i envy the hair line
a lifetime of violence will do that my nose was broken four times and my jaw but so much is the same the eyes you recognize the eyes
yes the eyes have it
i'm cool they didn't touch the machine or my disks probably didn't know what they were so you a moonie yet?  milo?
our eyes reflect our lives don't they? yours are so confident
how did you end up on remus?
they sent me there to die how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? it was  i was a slave and a monster the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me but one man took pity on me: the man who became my viceroy he taught me how to survive and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself i found my reman brothers they showed me the only kindness i ever knew
you're doing this to liberate the remans?
no race should be a slave to another
i have no reason to
all i have is my personal feelings  i wasn't raised with the ideals of the federation but i'm trying to understand them now to live up to them to live up to you
there's so much and so much of it is dull
were we always explorers?
no i was the first picard to leave earth  it caused quite a stir in fact but i had spent my whole life
i met this girl
looking up at the stars
yes
and you dreamed about what was up there about
new worlds
age before rank jean luc
i always hoped i would hit two meters
with a full head of hair
there is that
i know
if there's one ideal the federation holds most dear it's that all men all races can be united from the first time the vulcans came to earth we've sought a future of peace nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend ship in time when trust has been earned
what? come on is it serious?
i'm honored to think i might someday speak with such eloquence
in time
why am i here?
i was lonely
i need a sample of your blood what do your borg friends say? resistance is futile 
don't be so vain after we found it we made a few modifications an extra memory port a hidden transponder perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn i've gained access to starfleet's communications protocols i now know the location of your entire fleet   you may go
it's about destiny picard about a reman outcast who
you're not reman
and i'm not quite human so what am i? what do you see?  do you see a life you might have led? lost youth never to be recaptured?
i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is
i don't know
i see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do i see the man i will never be
i won't defend my life to you
my life is meaningless as long as you're alive what am i while you exist? a shadow? an enigma?
if your issues are with me this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation
oh but it does  we will no longer bow like slaves before anyone not the romulans and not your mighty federation we're a race bred for war for conquest
think about what you're doing shinzon are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
it amazes me how little you know yourself
i'm incapable of such an act and so are you
i think the facts speak for themselves the same noble picard blood runs in our veins had you lived my life you'd be doing exactly as i am look in the mirror and see yourself
we are
yeah he's your freak friend mandella's boyfriend  i guess since i'm not allowed to go out i should obsess over a dead guy too
i'm from a small town in slovakia  like the south here  the police is right a civilian is wrong  so i fled
did you tell alice?
it's just the two of us now jean luc as it should be your ship and mine you and me
why are you here?
to accept your surrender i can clearly destroy you at any time lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship
and what of the enterprise?
i have little interest in your quaint vessel captain if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years it will not be harmed
you know that's not possible
i know you'll all gladly die to save your home world
look at me shinzon do you feel the blood pumping inside you? your hands your eyes your nature are the same as mine buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten it's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are
long ago
not so long
no i keep thinking it'll go away but there's this  connection she's been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot plus i see her every day we're working on the same program she's  beautiful
childish dreams captain lost in the dilithium mines of remus i'm what you see now
i see more than what you are
he is what his life has made him
so if i gave you my life what would you do with it? would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? or could you change? could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? a father's words you never heard? could you do that?
i don't know
but you want to
please
i have no choices i can't fight what i am
i am
don't you think it's time to surrender? i'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces why should the rest of your crew have to die?
a beautiful geek? i don't wanna sound paranoid or like a pig but what're the chances?
on my way
two ships decloaking sir romulan
disruptors are offline sir
what about picard?
our greater goal is more important brother
but praetor you won't survive without him
it is invigorating
runs in the family
should i raise shields?
defensive pattern kirk epsilon geordi get those shields online
what d'you mean?
we're being hailed
let's go
yes praetor
he's gentler than i thought and he has a sense of humor
don't forget our mission shinzon we should act now time is running out
my time i'll spend it how i choose
find her again
no  this is wasting time
do as i tell you
have the doctors prepare i'll be on the bridge'
i dunno i guess larry's got me totally suspicious of that place
a matter of hours now
seven minutes
what?
you heard me
full stop and fire 
she is here
they're holding position
and?
they will obey praetor
it's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath
what does that mean?
none
the scimitar will serve my needs
but surely
i came this far alone 
you don't have to understand
and bringing the enterprise here? what possible purpose could that serve?
i have a purpose
then perhaps you will enlight en us?
silence romulan
now go i have some personal business
milo geeks don't have two girlfriends most don't have one

i thought we discussed patience commander
and mine is wearing thin young man we supported you because you promised action and yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with picard while
for the moment
and when i return you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect
i don't want to scare them away
i don't see anything
it's there the fog's thicker now but it's there what do you think started those fires?
there is they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses
flew? oh come on benny
i didn't plan this
probably kids
no we can handle this
i don't think so 
benny this is me i'm going to take a look
thank you
have a nice trip
how much are your rooms?
thirtyseven fifty for one person fortynine fifty for two
sure
i'll take that
oh we're not going to the campus
fill this out  will this be cash or credit card?
credit card
i'll have to run your card off now
we're only going to be here a few hours
it's still the full price
we should have let me see
i understand
what do you do?
i make maps
hey that sounds interesting you like it?
his snapples were in alphabetical order
eh yes
make any money?
no
you don't get rich as a cook either believe me i got a girl going to college this fall the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it
no
they're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes but i wouldn't trade having them for anything
it is beautiful
thank you
and don't be shy about your english you speak better than a lot of people i know  take care of yourself
he's got a gun
look we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here tell us the truthis that the truth?
well he micromanaged the company till it got too big  'guess he needs to micromanage something
what the hell do you think you're doing?
where did you stop last?
stay right there
what was your last stop?
elmo's
where's that?
about five miles back
major bell here sir we have to tell these people that we're friendly that this whole thing was a mistake is anyone trying to contact the ship?
shermin i want you and bell to start looking for the one on the ground
it's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes
she's a programmer?
houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit
they must have picked it up in space
there's no mistake? you're absolutely sure?
i saw it with my own eyes we've killed an extraterrestrial and
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
none and there's another one in the area that's alive i don't know if it's the only one i don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva
get the body out of there load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson they'll take it from there we didn't expect this shermin
neither did i
i'm going to the white house right now i'll try and get you everything you need
wait wait what are my orders if we find this thing?
heavy graphical background doing designinterface for skywire apps  you'll be working with her
what do you mean by 'contain?'
we don't think that's necessarily bad at least it's a point of contact
not necessarily bad if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for
that's not going to happen george unless you get us the help you promised us
we've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public it's been decided not to expand the search at this time
don't let them do it this way george it's too important we can't find this thing alone
you have to we're trying to contact the ship if we do i'll let you know immediately good luck
when can we expect containment?
well we're in pursuit of a green mustang
i've got a girlfriend remember?
it's in a green mustang?
yes it's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere
it's taken on a disguise
clarify that
it's made itself look like the woman's dead husband
oh shit
i'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk
i don't like it george
dammit shermin earlier you were asking for help what's changed?
it's messy the thing's got a gun we're just asking for somebody to get killed
right that's rare around here you know how nuns' remarried to jesus? 'posties are married to outpost
we don't know what else to do we need results
you'll get results one way or the other that's for sure okay
i'm gonna be here if you need anything
i'll make this as simple as i can george they disappeared
i don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air
george listen to what you're saying this thing's changed itself into a man disappearing may not be that big a deal
so far you've let it cross the heart of america for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security i don't see the humor in that
is that what's affecting your performance?
i'm not being unpatriotic and i'm doing my damndest to catch them bell's up on 80 and i'm down here on 70 past grand junction they're heading west if they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them all i'm asking is that you people think about it
you just do your job shermin we'll make the policy
#21 way behind schedule it's top secret but everybody knows it's a digital broadcast space they see the dishes on top the fiber optics going in
shermin
what's all this for?
we have a new directive i'm taking over
we don't have to do it that way we can catch him this time
washington thinks it's too late for that
i've never been taken off an assignment in my life give me twenty four hours and i'll have him for you
you're not hearing me
you can change a directive george you've done it before listen to me he's going somewhere in death valley lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop east is the nuclear site there are no roads in there she was teaching him to hitchhike i'm telling you we block the four roads into death valley and we got him
we'll do that but how are we going to hold him? he can change himself into a man he can disappear
that's the chance we have to take
gary's not into fiber optics he's betting everything on the satellites
no we don't
then you're going to have to do it without me
you're a career intelligence officer shermin you'll be in the air with us
you're talking about taking a life the most unique life form on this planet i think we're better than that
i'm afraid we can't let you go
what?
i just retired
shermin shermin
this is george fox
i want to speak to marc shermin
you wanna survive in the software business you cover your bets i gotta say this is the weirdest car anybody ever requested
you can speak to me mrs haydn i'm in charge of this operation now
if i don't speak to mr shermin i'm hanging up
okay
watch it they're coming out
i don't know someplace called elmo's look i just wanted to tell you that i'm all right and i'm on my way home

marc shermin

i'd love to have a baby but i can't
why?
i can't forget the baby okay? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells you'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way
i know that but the buses don't go there
what is hitchhike?
that's easy i'll explain that in a minute this is your ticket when you get on the bus here the driver will take this part you will ride to omaha when you get to omaha ask the driver 'salt lake city please i do not speak english'
'salt lake city please i do not speak english'
the driver will
where is he?
but i speak english
will you please do it my way? you'll get into trouble if you don't if anybody talks to you tell them i do not speak english
i do not speak english
right in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take  this part when you get to salt lake city ask the driver 'las vegas please'
'las vegas please i do not speak english' what is hitchhike?
you want this ticket?
yes
then don't be smart
you keep this now this is hitch hike  you stand on the side of the road the highway you understand? and you face the cars going in the direction you want to go when you see a car or a truck coming you stick out your thumb like this
the car will stop?
it was my decision not his
we're too late take a look
not every car but a car will stop maybe not the first car maybe number eight number fifteen
tomorrow morning start hitchhiking right away and
can i have the gun?
no
yes
go?
yes i have a long ride ahead of me  goodbye
goodbye
yes?
please stay
wait a second i'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place
what?
it's a kiss  goodbye
i was afraid
it was a mistake
no my ship was doing a map of all the suns and
stars when a sun is far away we call it a 'star'
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship my eh we kidnapped it on it there was a map that said how to come to earth this was very important before then we thought we were the only people in all the stars
you did? that's funny so did we
yes?
yes
we're all grateful for that really go out the way you came in?
we told our home and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk not to land not to shoot just to look from up there we came and the driver of my ship
the captain
the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home the police came and shot at us one of the people from my ship was killed
oh that's terrible i'm sorry was he a good friend?
i don't understand 'friend'
a friend is a person that is good to you someone you like to be with someone you like to laugh with
he was a good friend the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship
the police shouldn't have started shooting but you can hardly blame them you surprised them they didn't know you were up there when they saw you they thought you were here to hurt us
i understand
sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home
i thought you'd quit while you were ahead
what is hell?
it's bad
he will
are you my friend?
yes
i am your friend
why?
i don't know
i've noticed do you understand what they're saying?
not all but it feels like a kiss
what and watch all my earnings go  down the toilet?
yes
i'd like to hear it can you sing something?
i do not want to
don't be afraid i'd really like to hear it
that was beautiful
you liked my singing?
yes sing some more
but i have never seen this before i am not complete
on the radio they say it's good
hurry up
what do you want mr cunningham was it?
no get in
you can have one
i'm not sleepy anymore let's drive for a little while longer
no i'm just not tired let's go
the police are waiting for you up ahead there's a roadblock you have to go back
this car will take me to las vegas i cannot go back
the police know about lathrop wells we have to go another way come on
please understand if you go this way you'll never get to your ship the police know about lathrop wells we have to go another way i'll get you to your ship i promise
i will go but not you
you shit i'll decide if i go or not not you i don't know what you do on your planet but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did
call me ritchie miss fagina may i call you alotta  please?
i don't want you to be hurt
come on
i must meet my ship
why can't we wait here for a ride?
i feel better if i move
we're hundreds of miles from where you have to be
where did you learn that?
the cook
i can't stay on this planet
no one's traveling in this weather
you may
you promised you would get me to my ship
i will i will we still have another day
you promised
what do you want from me? there are no cars on this road i didn't ask for this stupid storm
you can stop i will go on alone
we're too far away to walk don't you understand?
i used the last one to jump off the cliff
let's find a place out of the rain i'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning
i can't be late i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet i don't know if my words went to the ship if i'm not there the captain will think i'm dead and go
we'll get a ride in the morning
your boss number two i understand that cat's involved in big underground drills
you're damn right i am
i do not get cold
nothing
horses
you don't forget anything do you?
no
do they talk?
no they don't talk we talk to them
i understand
i gave you a baby last night
virtucon's main interest is in cable television but they do have a subterranean construction division yes how did you know?
yes they are
you have been very good to me jennyhaydn  you said you wanted a baby so i gave you one
but
it will be human and it will look like this  but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have
i told you it's impossible for me to have a baby
you will have this baby if you want it if you don't i can stop it now
you don't make money gambling you lose it
what for?
i want to gamble
i understand  thank you
well i'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i'd like to be included in decisions

saki it to me
i've been investigating sightings for seventeen years mr shermin this one's real we have a dead extra terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive we've been visited it's finally happened and the sooner washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings the better off we're going to be
we better get it into the box come on
it was only an accident that we discovered them
i know but
twentyeight years
to the same woman?
yes
i tried it once fourteen years ago 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father the only thing i'm good at is this at least until yesterday
it was kind of like clicking maybe a language wasn't it?
listen to this  a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'
mmmm i feel extreme relaxation
it was a man though right?
the police think he was high on drugs
it was the husband the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman

hey he didn't look like no big time criminal to me
'milk milk lemonade  round the corner fudge is made  stick your finger in the hole and out comes a tootsie roll'
i wouldn't think so
that's what i thought so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late you know

i don't want to hurt anybody i just want to go home

he's no concern of mine as long as you don't talk to him  don't talk to anybody  you understand?  not with everything that's going on right now
you're too goddamned paranoid
paranoia's only reality on a finer scale
a tragic story no doubt  how'd you get up here?
you're going down
maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in  it was touching the way you stood by me in there  "stand by your man" i was moved  you were very good  i don't think he even understands that you did it for him
he doesn't know what's going on leave him alone
kiss me
i'd love to  but he keeps showing up  and you keep talking to him  i can't have that
fuck you
maybe later

yeah ok whatever you say  just answer one question  is anything wrong?  iris said you might be in trouble
you talked to iris?  when?
tonight
well i haven't seen her in months who knows what's going on in her head  you're really running out of excuses to come around aren't you?
i know you faith  you're afraid of something  what's going on?
damn what exactly do you do at virtucon?
let it alone lenny  it'll take care of itself
it's tran isn't it?  this guy is poison faith  listen to me  he's got you walled in on all sides  and he uses the wire too much he gets off on tape not on you
that's a good one coming from you
why don't you just split?  you don't love him anybody can see that  and to him you're just some kinda possession like a ferrari something to show the other guys
he has his uses too
what?  he gonna record you on his label?
maybe
come on faith  he's just toying with you  and when he gets bored you'll be yesterday's papers
damn right
it's you up on that stage not him you don't need him
i'll tell you all in due time after we make love but first tell me another poem
max pelcher?  you're kidding?
yeah for about a month now  lenny just stay away from tran okay?  and stay away from me  stop trying to rescue me  those days are over i'm a big girl now  stop trying to save me okay because i don't need saving just give up on me
can't do it
you know one of the ways movies still have squid beat?  because they always say "the end" you always know when it's over  it's over now please leave  i have to go on again in a couple of minutes
iris is dead  she was murdered
don't know  but this guy's real damaged goods  iris knew someone was after her and she said you were in danger too  now no more games faith  whatever you're hiding whatever's going on you have to get out of here now come with me right now  don't even think about it
then what?  then what lenny?  you going to protect me?  big tough guy you're a talker lenny  you don't even have a gun
i have a gun  it's under my bed
you don't know what you're fucking with here
tell me
i think it was wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'press the button pull the chain out comes a chocolate choochoo train'
faith we know about jeriko  iris made me a copy of the tape
oh god lenny  i was trying to keep you out of this
we should talk alone
no  mace is in this
yeah he figured out what to do all right
you think tran killed her?
the killer knew right where she was because he put her there
what a nightmare
you understand?  attorney  right? am i right?
that's right
oh yeah?  alright
oh you're very clever let's make love you silly hairy little man
a virgin brain  well we're going to start you off right  so what do you know about this?  save us some time
just what i've read  that the technology was developed for the feds to replace the body wire  and now it's gone black market  so uh do i get the deck from you?
i'll set you up get you a deck at my cost since my thing is the software
clips
that's right  clips  look i want you to know what we're talking about here  this isn't like tv only better  this is life  it's a piece of somebody's life  pure and uncut straight from the cerebral cortex  you're there you're doing it seeing it hearing it feeling it
what kind of things exactly?
exactly anything  whatever you want  whoever you want to be  fabri get us another round would you
i can get you what you want  you just have to talk to me  i'm your priest your shrink your main connection to the switchboard of souls  i'm the magic man the santa claus of the subconscious  you say it you even think it you can have it  you want a girl you want two girls?  i don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about you want a guy?  you want to be a girl see what that feels like? you want a nun to tie you up?  it's all doable
talk to me about costs here
listen before we get into numbers i want you to try a taste  i got a deck with me
hey how are you?
what?  right here?
step into my office
you nervous?  forget it  the cops have more to worry about in this city than the squidtrade believe me
okay  it was funny  but it cost me money
come on amigo the world's full of marks  and nobody knows how to work 'em like you do pal  you could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring  let me buy you a drink
least you can do
thanks max
d'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe
that's not sayin' much
hungry
it's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle
yup  so darn lucky  i wake up with a 22short floating in my brainpan and a cop pension i can't live off of  good thing i wasn't any luckier  bobby  another shooter right here
just as well lenny  you gotta get past it  i mean sure faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get i mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone but it's over campadre
thanks max  i'm touched by your concern
hey iris you okay?
uh unh carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket
an excop that doesn't carry  it's embarrassing  i oughta not be seen with you  hey mace  what's goin' on?
shutup a second
i was gonna tell ya  hey it's just a job  i feel like shit about it
you should feel like shit
here have this can of campbell's tomato soup
i figured what the hell i could take the prick's money and make sure faith was ok at the same time  do us both good  right?
fairly twisted logic max even for you  hey at least you got a job  watch her for me  stay on her
i'm on her
yeah  no not really
let's work it
not now i don't want to think about it
come on lenny  you used to be good at this stuff  play it down what's the perp doing?
he stalks her  he rapes her  then he does her
and he records it  thrill kill wants to see it again  and again
he records himself raping and killing her
if you can become famous everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame man
but at the same time he's sending the signal to her
so she feels what he feels while he's in her  the thrill while he's killing her is sent to her heightening her fear which in turn heightens the turn on for him  i've seen a lot max
so've i  too much
but this is a bad one
top ten
he makes her see her own death feeds off the reaction killer and victim merging orgasm and agony merging  and he records it all
why me?
w'sup max?
yeah  she's leaving with tran so i got to boogie  real quick iris checked into the sheraton last night under a false name  paid cash
looks like she was holding out
"fifteen minutes of fame?" i'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that either
yup  hey so i heard you dropped in on tran last night  another slick lenny move
he's in this somehow i don't know how  just stay close to faith
i'm on her amigo  no worries gotta jam
you may be a little overdressed for this party  yo tick  it's lenny  open up
is he dead?
no  but his frontal lobes are like two runny eggs  they put an amplifier inline to boost the signal till it frenchfried his brain
all i'm saying you don't know how high up the food chain this thing goes  i've heard stuff
what stuff?
smoke  rumors  i've heard stuff about a death squad  a group a guys loyal to the hardline school  guys that've had too many years of city hall and the review boards and the goddamn media pissing down their necks suspending cops right and left tying their hands while outa the other side a their mouths these same people're squealing save us save us do something you fucking morons crime is totally out of control
yeah  so don't walk near me in public alright
smashing
thanks buddy  see things weren't bad enough  they weren't fucking bad enough
okay what about strickland?
no  bad idea
what do you mean?
give him the tape  see?  it's fucking brilliant  the tape for faith  i know he'll go for it  i can set it up
this is what we laughingly refer to as a plan right?
come on  if he gives us any shit we kill 'em all  whattya say?  just get your butt down here  if i'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room  it's 2203  you writin'?
i intend to
only way i could stand your ties
where's faith?
we know all that exposition
i sent her to the party  i figured i'd wait up here until you killed tran
what makes you think i'm gonna kill tran?
jesus
you know statistically that's the second most common word people say right before they die  shit being number one
that's pretty much the way it happened
that's right  they'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment  the one i left for you at the club was a copy
was i a really busy guy?  did i do tick too?
you bet  did you like it?
i won't say anything
i know  so i'm working for this puke right?  and he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker but also i gotta do his bitch girlfriend cause she knows the whole score and she's totally out of control
i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time we've just received word that dr evil the ultimate square is planning to take over the world
and who was regrettably also your best fucking friend
no plan is perfect lenny  hey cheer up  world's gonna end in ten minutes anyway
you must be so pleased i followed your jellybean trail right here like a good little chump
you got froggy on me a couple times
naawww
just those two loosecannon cops running around covering their butts
yeah  pretty zany huh?  all this shit caused by a random traffic stop  hey nothing means nothing you know that  look around the whole planet's in total chaos  you gotta take what you can while you can  cause some shitbird can come up and put a fuckin' 22 in the back a your head any second
this dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her right?  but faith knows me from you right so she comes up to me and says 'hey max why you following me?' i say 'i'll buy you a drink and explain' and she says
well you could've at least warned me  you know i hate the zap when they die  it just brings down your whole day  jeez tick
sorry
dr evil? i thought i put him in jail for good
with all the blood i guess they didn't see the rig  guy had it under a wig
yeah but how'd it get to you?
i got ways lenny i got ways  okay okay i got a deal with some a the paramedics  my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue  so whaddya think?  this clip's gotta be worth at least a grand  right?
tick  not to dash your hopes but i don't deal this kind of product you know that  i'll give you four for it cause i've gotta cut off the last bit  and my customers want uncut
fuck that  the last part's the best  you drydive six stories and blammo  jack right into the big black
i don't deal blackjack clips  it's policy  i got ethics here
yeah when did that start?  come on man  it's what people want to see and you know it
so lay it off to somebody else
come on lenny  i got expenses  i got to get this rig fixed  look at it
yeah well the first part's okay better than the usual soaps you bring me
i'm ready to be briefed  excuse us
i'm afraid not earlier this week dr evil escaped from zedel edel prison in baaden baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the electric psychedelic pussycat swinger's club in picadilly circus here in swinging london
now that is cold lenny  i always bring you choice
hey you're always saying 'bring me real life  bring me street life and like one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's technicolor'
i said that?  look i'll take it for five and you'll make out okay because in this case it's pure cream you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer
ha  that's for fucking sure
what else you got?
skip the art criticism tick what can you tell me about the wearer
well the guy's fucked up
what?
well it's cutting awful close to me  i mean she was just here
who was just here?
good luck austin
iris man  pay attention
wait wait wait a minute  iris was here?
yeah she came by last night shaking like a junkie wanting me to make a copy of some clip
what clip?  what was it?
i don't know man she wouldn't let me see it  said i wouldn't want to see it  she said she was going to give it to you to hold for her like insurance or somethin'
she never gave me a tape
you're not a client anymore tran i wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls
i already got everything i need from you
yeah important for your label which no doubt is why you're in mourning  don't worry his records'll sell out now he's dead you'll make out
i always do
thank you
faith can i talk to you a second?
that would be between me and faith wouldn't it?
uh huh  look nero  i'll make you an offer  take her  right now  if she wants to go if she's unhappy here she can go  i'll let her choose  faith always knows what she wants  hands off  see?
i do mean it  and i mean this if faith stays you go away and never come back you scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again  you understand?
strickland
commissioner strickland
sure  whatever  see since you shitcanned my career i don't even have to call you sir  one of life's small pleasures
aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
i was invited here by a close friend mr fumitsu see he's right over there
your sex life?
oh and austin
your existence
they jerked my wheels d'you believe it?  i mean it's outrageous the computer errors the banks are making lately  have you noticed?
whoa whoa whoa  i said i'd drop you home but i'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds  i've already pulled twelve hours today
come on mace  this is gonna be a big night  can't you feel it?  the energy in the air?  there's money to be made dreams to sell
sleaze to peddle
just a couple of hours  it'll be fun
excuse me  what part of no don't you understand?
mace you're my friend  i need you plus i'll give you 25% of what i make tonight
lenny this may be a hard concept for you but friends don't have to pay their friends
mace  you're a lifesaver
yes?
driving mr lenny
no wrong i sell experiences sex is only part of it
buncha technoperv jerkoffs
way i look at it i actually perform a humanitarian service  i save lives
uh huh i wanna hear this part
okay take some executive bored with his life bored with his wife he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar  then he goes around for months torn up worrying that he's got aids that he'll infect his wife  and maybe he really does catch something
price he pays for being a scumsucking pig
everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime it's what we are  but now the risks are outa line  the streets are a war zone  and sex can kill you  so you slip on the trodes you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks
lenny this shit's illegal
define illegal
be careful
me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months
yeah but that was for love
define love
fumitsu
mr fumitsu good evening sir leonard nero security express lornette mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation  we do it to make sure that out vip clients such as yourself are always treated as honored guests  i just need to ride up front and take some notes if you don't mind
coming with you
you will not live to see the morning
let's talk in the car
i've had enough of this shit  you're on foot lenny
in la?  are you crazy?
thank you  let's go baby
get it
i've had it  no more wirehead shit in my car  you understand?  you want to poach your lobes do it somewhere else
okay you got my attention but this is cutting off the circulation to my head here  d'you mind?
no see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another  you just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act  well i'm out  i got a kid i got rent i got an ex husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support i'm just trying to hold on here
so am i  just trying to get by
no you're just trying to get off
macey i've never seen you like this
lenny you're turning into some kinda squidhead lowlife  you're always broke you just go from one score to the next  and you're getting strung out you don't even see it  getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer
i know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me thanks mace  really
look i gotta get some sleep
you're in the ministry of defense it's 1997 you've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years
you still like me don't you?  we're still buddies?
macey i know you're tired but can you drop me at the retinal fetish? it's on your way
jesus lenny
begging?  groveling?  any pathetic behavior at all?  will that help? faith's there tonight and i've got to talk to her
sure lenny  the only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love
guy named wade beemer  used to be a running back for the rams in '96 and '97
rams that's football right?
she still loves me
she thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit  trust me on this
she's my destiny
who are these people?
destiny?  you living in a perfume commercial?  she's a hardclimber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride
you'll see
i have crawled through the gutter through every wrinkle in the human brain
what i'm saying  but you still come out this goofball romantic
it is my sword and my shield macey
no idea
go to the sunset sheraton  right now  just go  go
black  jack
blackjack?  i don't understand
snuff clip  it was iris  she said she needed my help and i aw jesus mace the sick fucker killed her
the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process
are you sure it's real?
wants to share
i've never dealt in blackjacks never  everybody knows that
this guy is someone you know one of your squidhead contacts
so some psycho wirefreak gets to keep running around
you ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
never really thought about it
so that gives you something
it gives me i don't know maybe two hundred people who i know wear
i need to see more get more detail  something  i feel his presence so strong
yeah sure  beep me when you're ready for the press conference
yes i'm having trouble controlling  the volume of my voice
yeah  i'm ghosting pretty bad
it's not your fault
but that doesn't add does it
no it doesn't
because iris knew somebody was after her
so the guy's not a sicko
if he could do what's on that tape he's a sicko
okay so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak the point is he was a hitter somebody wanted to shut her up  but why not just put a little lead in her ear?
because it had to look random  not connected to anything or anyone  but then why give the rape to me?
that's where it gets a little strange
you might also experience a slight fever dry mouth and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation austin this is commander gilmour strategic command and general borschevsky russian intelligence
and what about the guy that was following me?
now you're really getting paranoid
sure
ok  he asks about you all the time it's been weeks since you've seen him
s'okay  i know you still love me
jesus mace
anywhere  we'll talk about it in the car
this tie doesn't go with blue
mace the guy had a knife  to my throat  in my living room relaxing might be right out okay?
you better keep a low profile for a while
russian intelligence? are you mad?
no shit  you got someplace in mind?
easy there mom  easy  this is audio only  john coltrane  "a love supreme" give it a listen let me know what you think maybe you won't go for it now but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful
she wanted to go out to my car something about my car
something in your car
it's in my case  okay?  i'm going to open my case
take it easy  the glass is bullet resistant
bullet resistant?  whatever happened to bullet proof?
lenny  calm down  this is what i do
it's okay lenny  they'd never get here in time anyway
the gas tank's going to go any second
a lot's happened since you were frozen austin the cold war's over
fire's out isn't it?
yeah me neither  it was one of my favorites  me and faith in a hot tub on my birthday  i'm going to really miss it
you sure?
it's the walk  something  anyway they'll run your plates and get your address  we gotta keep moving
i can't tell you  you've got to see
uh unh  i won't do it
mace  i know what you think about the wire  but i'm asking you to do this  it's that important
i see  i see the earth opening up and swallowing us all
yeah i know  so what do we do?
you know what this tape could do if it gets out
thank god those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people hey comrades?
i've got a good idea yeah
people finding out seeing that the lapd just flat out executed jeriko one  jesus  maybe they ought to see
maybe  but tonight is probably not the best night  come on we're rollin'
well look at the plus side
there's a plus side?
yeah  you gave up your hot tub tape to save me  that's real progress for you
it was a tough call
i still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did iris with those two cops
i don't think those cops did iris i think whoever iris was wearing for killed her
why?
we won austin
to break the trail  if those cops had gotten hold of her they would have beat it out of her who she was wearing for and then gone after them too  our killer is running as scared as we are  which makes him really dangerous  judging by how scared i am
how long does it last?  oh
yeah right blow it open
deputy commissioner palmer strickland  the sanctimonious prick who busted me out  his ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it  i know this guy  if there's one cop who's not dirty it's him
why didn't he just go public with the tape?  save himself that way
i'm not going
whatya mean?  we're going  tran's gonna do her right there unless
lenny shutup  just park your mouth and listen  it's a setup think about it  why's he been sending you tapes?  to freak you get you to rush in without thinking then they put one in you put one in her put the gun in your hand crime of passion  this guy's bent enough to think of that
it didn't stop you from loving them right?  or understanding them or being able to forgive them
i guess
groovy smashing good on ya  nice tie yea capitalism
and it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them  did it?
no  it didn't
you never told me
but she was different  there was a light in her eyes and she had this voice  it was scary all that pain coming out of that little body like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice  i helped her  and i promised her that i'd always be there to protect her  see?  it's not about what's in her head  it's what's in mine  i can't let go of the promise  it's like it's all i have left
no it's not
good lenny  i can see why the detective gig didn't work out  come on
no  they must have sent it to my beach house by mistake
uh unh
and do what?  take on his whole posse?
i still got one ace to play  tran's got what i want and i've got what he wants
immediately you'll be working with ms kensington
exactly  that's why it's a make able deal
a cop?  you want me to trust a cop?
no  trust me
then we'll be right where we are now
yeah right  fucked
naw  they just have to ask us a few questions for about six hours
yeah  we did
see you downtown
yeah  see you there
just lenny
you mean mrs kensington?
right  that explains it
are you going to make me beg?
cheerios and wieners  i made it myself  it's good
well give me some then i'm starving
aw mom
sucks  hey bobby turn that up
yup  he was jeriko's manager  bummer tran  lost your golden goose  couldn't happen to a nicer guy
but i mean isn't he faith's new 
sssssh  not in front of lenny  you may trigger a maudlin display which will force us to tranquilize him
maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate what he's created  it's the dark end of the street lenny how do you like it now?
no austin mrs kensington has long since retired ms  kensington is her daughter
take the tape to the cops
this seems a little sophisticated for them  these are not subtle guys
there's more to this whole thing than you think
fine  do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  the gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground  and when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves  it'll be all out war and you know it
yeah well maybe it's time for a war
you really want that on your head?
um he was older
besides that
to be honest when i'm working i don't look at faces much he knew the guy's name
testa?
who do you think chief?
my god vanessa's got a smashing body i bet she shags like a minx how do i tell them that because of the unfreezing process i have no inner monologue?  i hope i didn't say that out loud just now
the bearded guy the creep oh one other thing testa if that's his name he kept mentioning my feet said i had very pretty feet
zorro yes ran it through my files even asked around: came up completely blank thought there might be a mexico connection el paso and all but nothing fooled around with the letter "z" turned it on it's side got "n"  there ng he's vietnamese the only thing that came to mind was zero not zorro remember suspect zero?
no
before your time it was richard low's brainchild or lackofbrain child the behavioral sciences unit at quantico is essentially the product of three men: david koessler dick low and myself low was a field agent koessler administrative i was teaching criminology low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature he invented profiling everything we know about profiling started with richard low
pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials
you got that right low became obsessed with the green river murders the case had been inactive for ten years at that point he argued the green river killer had actually become suspect zero this master murderer who killed without pattern killed literally hundreds of victims  male female old young straight gay  and who was still killing even though there were no bodies it went against everything we knew low became increasingly paranoid every suspect was potentially suspect zero anybody tried to talk sense into him he'd accuse them of being out to get him deputy director koessler was "out to get him" the decision was made to relieve him
of course he knows everything about dick low
takes four days to chill then its time to come back  is that?
yeah
i'm babysitting the dea guys this afternoon casio and i you said that was top priority
thank you exposition
just mopping up nine bodies in all
anybody talk to the press?
no sir
the diner?
fella's name is harold speck travelin' man out of roswell
excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the fbi?
well the victim was killed at the turnaround over there then his car was pushed over here  right across the state line that makes it federal this is officer wallace he's out of alamogordo
ten miles back on the texas side
that's right jan
i'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself
oh and austin
i know how the feds like to sit on information i got something in the car to show you
you're thinking?
who knows
this isn't in our database?
i just assumed she ran away happens a lot around here look around this place is an invitation to run away
mack this is sheriff dylan
oh jesus sheriff i am sorry i meant to call you  i got distracted  the sumpter girl was not one of speck's victims that's the good news
what's the bad news?
you tell me
no bad news you know the be on the lookout you asked me to send on the diner car  we got a hit on it a little town on the border socorro we got it staked out  you interested?
yes?
i'm on my way
down the road a piece is the golden sunset the notell motel socorro's contribution to international relations the car's just sitting there no activity i've had a couple hispanic officers casing it all day want to take a look?
what does the manager say?
i sent a female in the room in question was rented by an anglo cash; since then nothing  no activity no phone response
let's take a look
and it's getting dark i'm not going to run this into the night  eddie we're walking in everything covered?
tape it off we'll want to finetooth comb it my guess is that the unsub is having us on he checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside tell me if i'm wrong
got a sister like this what they call it anal? that's her
sheriff dylan this is fbi agent thomas mackelway remember me?
hi there
be careful
i want to talk about the karen sumpter case
you heard?
what?
her body turned up in a minnesota cemetery they brought her back
she's buried
i want the autopsy report where is it minnesota?
winona
i'm sorry this won't take long
the body was embalmed i don't understand 
turn the body over there was something in the autopsy report yes here  these burn marks
thanks
a grill pattern
we need to run this through vicap search for similar burns
i'm not in the mood for native american wisdom
we had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this
i appreciate it doctor you know how it is press screaming for answers washington's all over me  ever handle a serial case?
this is agent mackelway
that's the thing don't know if it connects but harold here had a thing about eyes two of the victims had their eyes gouged out another punctured took polaroids after
not a discrepancy an error my capacity is 55 tons not 6
i have 6 tons
mam it's my truck i know my own capacity
thank you exposition
you can't imagine how many men have told me that
it's been customized for sleeping capacity
oh yes i see you must get asked this a lot
not as much as you'd think
hi what's in the case?
sorry i've seen you in here always lugging that case around  whatja sell?
ah restaurant supplies i didn't get your name
you must travel a lot huh?
yeah
whole country or just hereabouts?
oh and austin
i don't mean to be rude but
just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  how does your wife feel about it?
what?
about your being away all the time must get lonely
look
you must get lonely you ever think about you know 
excuse me?
you know you ever think about other women?
fucking i'm talking about fucking harold you ever think of fucking other women?
take a look harold tell me if you see anything you want you do like to look don't you?
yes?
not bad huh?
you're a you're sick
what's wrong with me?
oh god mister please leave me alone
you're going to miss it pay attention
what do you want from me?
why me? what do you want from me?
yes
what did he look like?
i didn't wait on him fifty or so white regular build needed a shave  that's all i remember
be careful
how did you know he was a construction worker?
he had an orange hat on
it's been wiped down a hundred times since then
what kind?
an old junker like a reservation car blue side door with brown you know primer paint new mexico plates a ford or ah yeah a ford
put a bolo out on that
what about his killer?
nada vague description that's all finetoothcombed speck's car the diner: no fingerprints no trace evidence
what's with the eyelids?
at the field office
can we go now?
then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
right away exposition
let's take a look at it  drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here
maybe something to do with zorro
don't say that don't even think that the next thing we'll be hearing about "zorro killer" in the media  this hasn't gotten out has it?
just hospital talk nothing that connects to speck
this could all be a coincidence but you know something i don't believe in coincidences that's why i came back  do you think the unsub  we're not going to mention the word zorro  met harold speck online?
just an observer
maybe cause he's smart
smarter than us
what?
we have another one
where is vanessa by the way?
another what?
serial killer killed in ft myers cut up in his van and this time we got a witness
what are you doing?
please
just step outside sir now keep your hands where i can see them
this better be important
who?
speck harold speck
from the grave?
mydick
then you'll have to go it alone good luck
they don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms 
i might point out agent mackelway the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us  which is also why you were reassigned
i had gotten their trust we were sharing fantasies i couldn't risk it
the federal bureau of investigation is not based on personal preference we share information
let some bythebook j edgar agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover?  no way
you refused to comply with a direct order
i was lucky to find much less crack the address code  no way to be sure i could have done it again
its called insubordination
then why do i still have a badge?
pretty embarrassed to be honest i had him
thank you basil
agent kulok and i were in o'hare when we heard
he got away i had him he got away
do you think he singled you out?
no just coincidence he knew who i was of course he had my id  did he keep it?
go ahead
this time sir if i may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside ciiac perhaps in military housing at quantico? i didn't get along very well with the other members of the division we thought differently
you didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder  why was that? what were you doing?
if my reporting agent could be someone outside computer crimes perhaps agent kulok?
what i do requires confidentiality
i always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special? why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? why you?
oh and austin
they like my stories they like the way i think they're into fantasy i turn them on
had trouble sleeping last night sir
okay harold speck: who goes first?
i don't believe this
i'm hesitant to
mack the mouth at a loss for words
i spoke with lloyd daitz
that gasbag i can imagine what he said i'm not ashamed to admit that most of what i know about criminal profiling started with richard low i have also over the years i admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments he was the most brilliant law enforcement individual i ever met
"was?"
we had every reason to believe he was on that plane he was supposed to be on the plane everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site we the director and i decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare dick low dead that way he could exit a hero
yes?
you suspected all along suspected he was alive that's why you came to el paso
dunlevy said there was another case ron rice in fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered the second was george sheldon i didn't enter it into vicap  i'll get you the file
how long ago?
both in the last year i suspected only someone as brilliant as dick low could find these guys  look whatever daitz told you nobody wanted to strip richard of his badge you have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close
you knew the arm slash was not "zorro"
i suspected but you were the one low contacted that's why i brought you back here
what did you think of the suspect zero theory?
it was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact suspect zero came to represent every killer dick low had not caught the idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine for someone like low there would always be a suspect zero we couldn't let richard go where that idea was taking him
collected shoes too?
we need to put out an ncic inquiry
let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation
how do you send out an apb on a dead man?
huh? sir
i want to catch dick low more than you can imagine but i cannot risk going public what happens when the media finds out that a former fbi special agent a founder of the behavioral sciences unit is not dead but instead alive and killing people not ordinary people but even worse serial killers making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  you keep at it we'll find him we'll find him in our own way
i was visiting an old college friend
you didn't tell anyone where you were?
an oversight sir i apologize i felt i needed to get away for a day the pressure paid for my own ticket
i'm told you've asked for a bureau crosscheck of flight records to and from el paso ft myers omaha the murman murder time frames
i was looking for a pattern
that breaks my confidentiality stipulation
i didn't use low's name
oh yes thank you
there was talk of a file photo
in ft myers before your instruction nowhere else sir
i understand
as far as the public knows richard low is dead and he will stay dead until we kill him
i need to get to amarillo immediately
have you told richard low about amarillo?
i can't the chat room isn't open for another five days
we'll wait get online with low inform him of zero's route  we'll set a trap for him
what about zero darryl hawkins?
hawkins isn't the target richard low's the target
there's one more thing austin
there's a killer out there  we know who he is he could be stalking now
dick low's a killer too
you're as crazy as he is he's right you don't give a damn about saving lives at all fuck you
thank you rangers  put this man in the unmarked
you better hope the director doesn't stop abruptly one day david you might break your nose
you're a disgrace to law enforcement to the bureau  and to me
how did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  the deputy director here he believes in tough love a cop's cop shape up or ship out righto? agent kulok when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials you'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers some years ago that's a dave koessler trick find a pliant sociopath preferably a dead one attribute to him unsolved cases clean up the backloglooks great in the yearly report
suspect zero now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper 
listen to this guy? can you believe this? he'll never change born a liar first word out of his mouth was a lie make up a story always a story any goddamn story to save his ass
shut the fuck up or i'll shut you up
yes?
you have to save this boy good exists in this world i can prove it because you can in your life save this one person
they sort of got me on shit detail no offense
none taken
maybe i shouldn't put it that way i'm on my best behavior i've got to watch what i say
you used to be in the behavioral science unit right?
the academy then ciiac
i read your white paper it's sort of like the bible for what they're trying to do in computer crime
how long have you been downtown?
five months i love it
not especially
'cause we got more important things to do like finding out who did it
be careful
why did he come out here? what's going on?
beats me he just asked me to come along doublecheck the forensics  what did you do to piss him off?
yeah you know the vic's car he was killed this side of the state line the car then pushed across the border this by an unknown subject presumably the killer who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot which may or may not have been accidental
doesn't fit
this is no random killing no one shot deal the unsub has killed before; he's good at it so what do we have?  we have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer  and who wants the fbi to know he exists
and who kills in the manner of his victim
that information's being withheld from the media
a very sexy case
where's my watch? it's gone
it explains a lot
thank you
the man knew how to dress
don't even go there what's up?
setting up technically anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address but by using punters a correspondent literally punts his address around the world through computers in countries that have no communication treaties the correspondent becomes "ghosted" invisible
what about the chat rooms themselves?
that's the beauty of the system this is a fugitive chat room it moves from place to place chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website chaucer buffs a dating service a pre arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms  that's where i stumbled across it  notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time usually midnight to three eastern standard at a certain website  a deserted chat room say "how to plant perennials" come tuesday twelve am bingo these likeminded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip who did what to whom who wants to do what when why and how
that's part of the reason i dropped by i need to learn this stuff
the other reason?
you want to have dinner?
they're all criminals?
no no no most of them  i used to think all of them  are just fantasists guys who get off telling degrading stories when i came across this fugitive chat room listened in i started to think some might actually be real that they'd gone live the challenge was to figure out which was which then i had my disagreement with koessler
austin vanessa let me bring you up to speed dr evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for onehundred billion dollars if the world doesn't pay up in four days he's threatening to destroy the world
"gone live?"
chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "i went live last month"
this is some serious shit
taking a stryker saw cutting off the top of someone's cranium pulling the brain out  what's that a day in spring?
you got a point there
people end up in occupations for a reason they may think not but they do: occupations define us
i was going to be a physician i am a physician but i kept drifting over to criminal psych this seems to be the best of both my parents still haven't forgiven me
i was interested in two things: computers and crime they sort of came together
and one other thing
what's that?
thank you exposition only two things scare me and one is nuclear war
sex
grown man dressed like a clown does he really think he looks good?
he thinks he looks young
what's this country coming to?
take it to the next level what are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like? if he could act out his fantasies what would he do? imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands what is he thinking?
my guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae
me too  make any headway with "zorro"?
none can't find a thing nothing on file nothing online it's not a part of any known killer's signature
i was thinking maybe we should ask professor daitz nobody knows this stuff better
that's because he's a fucking wacko never met a selfpromotion scheme he didn't like what's he doing now?
what's the other?
he's a consultant to a network tv program on profilers he gets a check every episode
don't be too harsh
i saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends not the victims not the families of the victims he doesn't talk about them blood money that's what it is  did he hit on you?
huh?
when you were his student? did he come on to you?
of course he did he came on to every attractive student which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
you must really think i'm a square a computer nerd
no mack i do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd
because you asked him to stupid
oh yeah i forgot
excuse me?
"intraagency fraternizing"
it's a nono
i know
i've been thinking about this
does koessler ask about me?
he's called a couple times
what did you tell him?
just routine stuff
not about coming to see daitz?
not yet not about this either
what's the other thing you're scared of?
no cut off while he was still alive look at his wrists damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free must have been screaming real loud when the killer chainsawed his throat unfortunately he'd soundproofed his van
we got an unsub walking around with four feet?
we did find these however
we're trying to match them with dump site bodies  this we know is carol delview from tampa found her last spring this one 
sue ann hanson
you mean 
you found the body she was one of harold speck's victims in el paso  they're not just talking to each other mack they're trading souvenirs
not yet this time they're waiting for you
murman and imelda had been slipping into a private chat room low had poor old testa drooling on the keyboard abduction fantasies voyeurism mutilation teasing him with fetish elements he is very good i think it's safe to say richard low is murman
no jaime i apologize i didn't i had no right to speak to you like that
carnies
i came over because i couldn't sleep and was lonely i wanted to see you i thought i'd surprise you
you did
i can't they trust me they accept me i've got their confidence
no i mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me
oh
that's true
then there's the other issue
what's that?
you need time to think about the case about you and me
i found a peephole into deviant world i'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out
what?
and nobody else can do that?
not the way i can
that's my point remember you're a cop pretending to be a deviant it's not the other way around
don't confuse what we do with who we are
i just need to go a little slow
jaime? where are you?
where are you? everybody's looking for you
what's up?
i'm in omaha get to the airport there's been another one
you want to get him? find something he wants get him to come to you
circus folk  nomads you know they smell like cabbage
start killing people for real?
suspect zero
that's a crackpot theory everybody says so
but he believes in it that's all that matters he toyed with you you toy with him convince him you've got a lead on suspect zero use zero you'll find low
i guess i'm a little paranoid
what's going on?
slow down a second you met with low 
you were right he found me
and you're working with him?
i need something tangible to hook him i told him i'd found the confidential file on the suspect zero theory
i came to see how the investigation was going  i called and you're not here  i wait up at the station and you don't even show up  i beep you  you don't return my call  where the hell have you been?
indeed if we could get back to the business at hand it's one thing to have a warhead it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it
does one exist?
probably i told him koessler had ordered the report kept it secret
koessler doesn't know any of this?
i've decided to investigate low's plane crash while i'm at it i thought i'd look at the cases koessler worked with low
it's too late for that i've gone ahead of the curve on this one there's no turning back when this is over koessler is going to be right or low is going to be right or i'm going to be right but not all of us
it's okay to be wrong just don't be dead wrong
they say richard low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead
you're putting me in a difficult position
i got an autopsy report from el paso that doesn't seem right a girl on low's list karen sumpter we're getting a court order to exhume to body i'd like you to come and look at it  don't worry i've cleared it
mack i'm just trying to keep up with now
maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle  i've uncovered the details on project vulcan it's a new subterranean warhead delivery system
could be a lot of things depends on the freezer  i'm sorry mack but i don't think this is the answer
hardly anyone calls me tom everybody calls me mack i always liked that
you okay?
yeah of course
what's going on?
burn marks the original me listed it as "burn residue" same place the outer thigh as karen sumpter the unsub is able to abduct kill transport and bury without detection
all the same killer?
low calls him suspect zero
suspect zero is a crackpot theory you said so
that's what koessler wants us to believe to discredit low
good god and underground missile we've long feared such a development
you're assigned we're assigned to apprehend richard low not suspect zero i have to tell you mack i'm not comfortable where you're going
but it was your idea: "use zero" you said use zero to get low
i
i've got to take a piss
it's a truck a refrigerated truck
zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away karen sumpter was buried washed up in a flood evans was buried when we get zero we'll find boneyards all across the country
how are we going to find him?
get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years we've got three disappearance cities and dates three parallel discovery cities get into the mainframe let it crunch this information
i'm going to amarillo
kulok
that's not your mother that's a man
agent kulok could you wipe my face?
sit back
of course he does now get the key get these things off me  unhook me
i want to protect the boy i also want to protect suspect zero  from you
no weapon
turn around stretch your arms over the seat
i'll be back
the little piggie speaks
i'll give you a little hint you're a smart guy figure it out
yes
damn it man you're talking about my mother
this is richard low stay on the phone do not disconnect i'm watching you i will instruct you where to drive
yes sir
when you exit head east on 10th
i believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops
how's the arm?
i've been reading hearing about you i spoke to koessler professor daitz
he couldn't break an egg with a hammer he still writing those crime porn books?
he's moved on to tv
he always had a weakness in that area i saw it the first time i met him we all had our weaknesses i guess daitz wanted the money with dave it was the glory koessler saw the behavioral sciences unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things he had his eye on the director's job even then catching killers was a means to an end for them
i'm not sure exactly i had monsters on the brain i wanted to get these guys every one of them i got obsessive
you must admit she is rather mannish no offense but if that's a woman it looks like she's been beaten with an ugly stick
suspect zero?
deputy director koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking highprofile failure better to get rid of me then he could be mr serial killer mr authority on deviant behavior  no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one richard low do you really think that plane crashed by accident? do you really think i wasn't on it by accident? i've always had a good sense of intuition
so you went underground?
was i afraid of dave koessler? not likely i told you i'd gotten a bit obsessive it was an opportunity to back off think things through  where's the file?
i don't carry it with me
you're a smart guy tell me what it says
"agent low's theory of suspect zero the undetected serial killer is delusional the product of good intentions paranoia and obsession"
the file however was kept open after your death npe disappearances no plausible explanation were sometimes filed there deleted if the bodies were found
zero killed them all?
of course not they're possibles i've checked them against bureau records check them against your file how did you get it?
i think if everyone were honest they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag
daitz hinted it existed it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms
how do you know who's real and who's not?

updating the condition of all bureau owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir
i'd say that about sums it up exposition
sounds like fun
i screwed up twice sir
i see that washington to philadelphia to here philly's a nice station how many agents?
four hundred and sixty sir
"attitude adjustment issues"  what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
i wished to be reinstated at computer crimes i was undiplomatic in my request
this is a first you criticized the deputy director to his face and you still have a badge? you must have some oneofakind skills  why don't you just quit? i mean you're not going to get promoted not wearing this jacket
i like working for the bureau sir i like catching bad guys it's all i care about
jesus just what i need another blue flamer  johnny get this boy some sun screen
yes sir
not quite actually vanessa i have something for you
got a vehicle?  head north on 54 when you get to new mexico you've gone too far
this case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to washington your old boss is coming out
koessler?
the same
hope you never do at first it feels like a sauna by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory
mydick as in my dick that was his screen name
i don't
eight nine months ago when i was at computer crime i got into a chat room with someone named mydick i'd talked to him before everything i saw yesterday everything in the autopsies it's identical the forensics are dead on mydick's fantasies involved a hogtie rig nylon cord torture with pliers rip the nipples  when the "item" screams she chokes he had a thing about eyes always the eyes  stab their eyes it's the same guy speck was mydick
speck is dead
i talked to him
austin i have something for you as well
he wants us to know he's out there what he's doing it's not enough just to kill somebody like speck he wants us to know he did it
350 miles
now mr hawkins when last in amarillo where did you get gas?
excuse me agent mackelway?
this man hawkins has killed dozens of people suspect zero
what is it exactly i don't understand agent mackelway?
deputy director koessler doesn't want zero all he cares about is low
perhaps you can explain it to him  it's agent mackelway
murman
he's a brilliant man brilliant enough to catch you
thanks basil maybe the nineties aren't so bad after all
brilliant? you think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? hardboy? mydick? imelda? ripper? think about it how did he locate them?  he found them as murman and how did murder man find them? with sweet talk and brains? no he did it with souvenirs he took them into private rooms swapped goodies: pictures panties jewelry body parts snuff downloads as bait that's why i never exchanged with him he killed girls oh yeah harvested them he had the best stuff richard low is murman and murman is one of us
it's over for you
take your shirt off
shit
you have to put things in perspective
i know i know
you've been through worse
you're right i know
ever since i've known you
i don't know about that
yes basil?
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this
it didn't feel that way
that's because it was a challenge you has control over you're situation it was hard but you rose to it
okay i'll think about that bye
you really should life after all is really just a series of challenges
enough i've got to use the phone
are you calling her?
no stop come on
shuddup
shut up
be careful
you're money baby
what do you drive?
i'm sorry?
what kind of car do you drive?
oh a cavalier
i'm sorry i couldn't help it let me make it up to you
i've seen you somewhere where have i seen you?
you ever go to the kelbo's? on pico?
maybe
monday nights? i host an open mike
hey mick
you're a comedian?
yeah
what's that like?
well you know it's tough a lot of traveling a lot of hotels but you know it's a dream and the money's really good i think i might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in vegas
i know starbucks i served you an espresso at starbucks
are you sure? maybe
yes remember? you asked me for an application? i introduced you to the manager?
oh yeah boy that must've been a while ago
i'd say about two weeks
probably a little longer than that but whatever
are you more satisfied now sexually austin?
you better pay the man
nikki
thank you nikki
hi
i'm mike
hi mike i'm lorraine
like the quiche?
yes like the quiche
i like quiche
i thought real men don't like quiche
well you can't always get what you want
my reputation seems to have preceded me
why? you're not a real man?
not lately
just like that?
well it wasn't the simple but yeah
how was it hard?
well i left someone very special behind
tell me about it
you too?
yeah
i let her take a shower
"you can't always get what you want" that's a great title for a song i'm gonna write that and it'll be a big hit
i thought i was going to die
it's been six months and i'm just starting to get over it
oh god that's two more than me tell me it gets better
it does
how?
well it still sucks but you start to see that there are advantages to being single
like what?
what what? what advantages?
what else? let's see you have complete freedom
to do what?
good on ya man
i don't know to grow to go out whatever you want
anything?
anything
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance? i can do that?
uh if the guy wants to
you don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
yes i mean no i mean maybe he would find her i mean you attractive maybe he doesn't like to dance maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either
maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song if that's what he's afraid of
no maybe that's not the case maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to
mike
groovy
oh you know
did you um did you get that pilot?
no man i know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me it wasn't that funny anyway
piece of shit listen charles this is my friend rob from back east
i don't even tell them about anything i'm close on anymore
not until you book it
and even then
you might get cut out
why not? this place is dead anyway
what else is going on?
well destructacon 5000 you have quite a head on your shoulders i dare to coin
then ask where you met her
yeah i'll tell her i don't remember and then i'll ask what she looks like  then i'll ask if we fucked how's that tee? is that "the money"?
my pleasure
i haven't heard an official "no" yet
you haven't told then huh?
no
i still haven't told my folks i didn't get "deepspace 9" you'd think they'd'a figured it out by now but mom keeps asking
hey man at least it's disney
four days?
i mean does it have to be "goofy"? i was playing hamlet offbroadway two months ago for crying out loud
yes i am programmed to answer any question
oh are we late? there are no clocks in this town
well no harm done this is lisa i'm sorry i never got your names
they were auditioning for the same role as you?
wait wait listen so i check the time and place i'm where i'm supposed to be i call my agent she says they asked for me specifically
what an asshole
don't worry he's in good hands
no matter what like splitting aces
i'm a "dorothy"
did you get it?
and she's with someone else
really? let me ask you this what is love?
the poor thing i'll make some coffee
i believe it too he really just wants her to be happy
he is so sweet
could you believe it?
wait here i'll get you that martini
nah i didn't really want it anyway i just wanted to order it
can i get you something else? i mean you shouldn't leave without getting something for free
no thanks why ruin a perfect night
i'm a comedian
sorry?
that does not compute
you have to lay it on the table
uh i don't want to bet it all
oh right
you want this in black chips
sure that'll be fine
yes but i'm afraid this table has a hundreddollarminimum bet perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables
no
you should a lot of comics play vegas
well i'm afraid it's not that easy
why not?
why not? it's a question
there are different circuits it's hard to explain you wouldn't understand
who's your booking agent?
oh? you know about booking agents i don't uh actually have a west coast agent as of yet
well who represents you back east?
actually it's funny you i'm actually uh between
what do you do trent?
i know but she did she's with someone else now
already? you poor thing it won't last
why not?
it's a rebound
love is love is love is
we were a rebound and we lasted six years
yeah but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
six years
sure i guess the phone's in the back
i understand
well you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you
listen i had a great time
me too
i would love to see you again sometime
i'll be around
don't try to suck up to me it's a little late for that i'm a freak look at it it's been rendered useless
that's not good enough i want to make plans to see you
let me get a pen out of my car  do you have something to write on?
yeah and an actor
i'll have to come see you sometime
if and when i get a real gig i'll call you
it's not going to well?
when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sitcoms to standups at the airport i got off the plane in la six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan
didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
yeah but entertainment law isn't something you just jump into
neither is acting not if you're serious about it  can i have one of these?
a shower?  did you take one too?
oh forget it as a fellow player on the international stage mr  powers i'm sure you'll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act
why you like the duck with the cigar? 
yeah nice touch it's the logo from "you bet your life" right?
good eye not one club owner got it they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card
hey at least it's not goofy
it's really getting late
home it's getting late yeah
nah i'm right across the street
which one?
the red piece of shit over there
well it suits you
no mr powers i expect them to die even after they pay me the money i'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma  all right guard begin the unnecessarily slowmoving dipping mechanism
get the hell outta here already
hi mike?
lorraine?
are you on the other line?
yeah hold on
i can call back
no no hold on
you didn't have to get off the other line i would've called you back
that's okay i wanted to talk to you
listen mike you really didn't have to get off the line i just wanted to ask you one thing i know i shouldn't have called i mean my friends said i should wait two days oh god i probably sound like such a schoolgirl it's just that it's tonight only i mean it's sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "the room" do you know where that is? it's impossible to find if you've never been there i don't understand why none of the clubs in hollywood have signs anyway i'm so bad at this if you're not busy i thought you might
well done mr powers we're not so different you and i it's true you're british and i'm belgian you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding you're thin i'm about forty pounds overweight ok we are different i'm not making a very good point however isn't it ironic mr powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be evil? maybe we have more in common than you care to admit
six months
how are you doing?
fine i guess you?
good  i think about things
yeah?
yeah
what kind of things?
you know us
i thought you met someone else
it doesn't matter i think about you every day
no man what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you whose bag was money and world domination we were innocent man if we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation we would have done things differently but the spirit would have remained the same  it's freedom man
really?
i miss you mike
why didn't you call?
i couldn't do you know how hard it's been not to call you? i pick up the phone every night whenever that commercial comes on
the michelin commercial
yeah with the baby in the tire one time i started to cry right in front of pierre
pierre that's his name? pierre? is he french?
no he's not listen i don't want to talk about him that's a whole other headache i called because i heard you might be moving back to queens
i heard you might be moving back
yeah uh i don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon listen can i call you right back? i gotta take this call
your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of face it freedom failed
i'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week can't you talk for five more minutes?
i really want to catch up with you but i've gotta take this call they're holding i'll talk with you when you get back in town bye
goodbye i lov 
you don't call
but you said i shouldn't call if i wanted to give up on her
right
so i don't call either way
right
so what's the difference?
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back see you can't do anything to make her want to come back you can only do things to make her not want to come back
that's why right now is a very groovy time man we still have freedom but we also have responsibility
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her
right
well that sucks
it sucks
so it's almost a retroactive decision so i could like let's say forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her
right or more likely the opposite
right wait what do you mean?
i mean first you'll pretend not to care not call  whatever and then eventually you really won't care
unless she comes back first
ah see that's the thing somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore
really there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster
there's the rub
there's the rub
thanks man sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time
hey man don't sweat it
it's just that you've been there your advice really helps
no problem
rob i just want you to know you're the only one i can talk to about her
thanks thanks man
it's a gig
i mean i need the money
not really kill the little bastard see what i care
you're an actor find the zen in the role
it's definitely a step back for me
look there's not much of a call for shakespeare in this town
there's just something about being "goofy" any other disney character would be fine there's just this stigma associated with the character
what do you want? you're tall
do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? i still haven't told them i didn't get the pilot
you tested over a month ago i'm sure they figured it out by now
it's like "hi mom i'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and oh by the way i'm goofy send more money"
i didn't want to say anything
why?
man you are one chilly square
i don't know it's like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter
what? like you didn't want to jinx it?
kinda
i don't talk about her that much
oh no?
i didn't mention her once today
well until now tend the pin
i do good for you man
i've decided to get out there  go ahead play it out
i shouldn't mike it's a weeknight
well as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection while at the same time experimenting with mindexpanding drugs in a consequencefree environment i'll be sound as a pound
what do you have? a pluto call back?
sure kick me when i'm down
i don't know eight or nine
i'll give you an eight 
what'd you get?
an eight
looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole this is turning into quite a rivalry
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven
oh  where is this place?
it's one of these for some reason cool bars in la have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front
no  nothing happened
my mother's told me all about you
that doesn't sound too good for business
it's kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing it's kinda cool it's like you're in on some kind of secret you tell a chick you've been some place it's like bragging that you know how to find it the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there you have to have someone come before there is a direct line connecting you back to the original unequivocally cool club patrons it's kinda like judaism
sounds more like aids
that's probably a more appropriate analogy
classy
bud
a dewars on the rocks and a bud please
i know it's like the opposite of inbreeding the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool
darwinism at its best
i've been around here six months and i still can't get over it
if it's a lie goddamn her it it's the truth goddamn me  god i hope that's witty how's your mum?
it's like every day i see a beautiful woman i'm not used to that i'm used to seeing a beautiful woman i don't know once a week i can't handle it
wait till summer i swear you can't leave the house it hurts it physically hurts
i can't wait till i actually get to touch one of them
ah there's the rub
there's the rub
i just tested for one
yeah a month ago
well let's hit that party
sue his dad was big johnny cash fan
oh like that song
my mother's doing quite well thank you very much
"a boy named sue" i think that's why he's such a bad cat
him?
he's a mean dude i've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb he knocked out his teeth blood he was just like boom boom boom fuckin nasty shit man he's a nice guy though
it's unbelievable
i got to at least try once
you're a better man than i am charlie brown
no i just promised myself i'd give it a try i gotta get out there sooner or later
go for it man
i'll be your winger
no problem buddy you eat anything today?
listen mr powers i look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby you can address me as agent kensington we have to leave immediately we've preserved your private jet just as you left it it's waiting at heathrow airport
no just oj
don't sweat it now i got an la gun story you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home he had an uzi mike halfsmiles
what's the point?
it's been two days you should call that girl nikki
oh boy
i'm such an asshole
she wasn't your type anyway
well that's dumb
what's dumb about it?
well you're doing so well
my jumbo jet? smashing baby
how am i doing well? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie big fuckin' deal i'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians how good am i doing?
at least you didn't get turned down for goofy
they turned you down?
they went for someone with more theme park experience i woulda killed for that job
i didn't make it
that's your problem man you can't see what you've got only what you've lost those guys are right you are "money"
because you left man she's got her own world to deal with in new york she was a sweet girl but fuck her you gotta move on you gotta let go of the past the future is so beautiful every day is so sunny out here it's like manifest destiny man i mean we made it what's past is prologue that which does not kill us makes us stronger all that shit you'll get over it
how did you get over it? i mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
sometimes is still hurts you know how it is man i mean each day you think about it less and less and then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all and you almost miss that feeling it's kinda weird you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long and the boom something reminds you of her and you just smile that bittersweet smile
for the same reason you miss her you lived with it so long
i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages i wanted to travel  see the world in my last year i was accepted into the mod in the cultural studies sector i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country it's very boring my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative

it's just that i've been out of the game so long trent i was with her for six years that's before aids i'm scared i don't know how to talk to them i don't know
you can't think like that baby it's hard i know i've been there not for six years but i know you just gotta get back out there
it's just tough after sleeping with someone you love for so long to be with someone new who doesn't know what i like and you gotta wear a jimmy
gotta
and then i'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend who i'm not even really attracted to
oh fuck that you don't have to try and impress anyone you think i give a shit? you think i sweat that skanky whore waitress
that's what i'm telling you baby the babies love that stuff they don't want all that sensitive shit you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream they know what you want what do you think? you think they don't?
what?
i know i know
they know what you want believe me pretending is just a waste of time you're gonna take them there eventually anyway don't apologize for it
i'm just trying to be a gentleman show some respect
respect my ass they respect honesty you see how they dress when they go out? they want to be noticed you're just showing them it's working you gotta get off this respect kick baby there ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party
i should've said renaissance right? it went over her head
baby you did fine
"age of enlightenment" shit like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference how demeaning i may as well have just said "let me jump your ignorant bones"
baby
it's just i thought "renaissance" was too excaliber it's the wrong casino she would've gotten it though

she didn't like me anyway
she thought you were money
i don't think so
i heard them talking they both thought you were money

but it's worth the risk true or false: it's worth the risk
true
you are so money and you don't even know it
that's what i keep trying to tell him  you're so money you don't even know
you're like this big bear with claws and fangs

you're like a big bear

you're so fuckin mmmoney
now go over there and get those digits
you're money
now when you talk to her i don't want you to be the guy in the pg13 movie that everyone's pulling for i want you to be the guy in the rated r movie who you're not sure if you like
yeah
i used to wait two days now everyone waits two days three days is kinda money now don't you think?
yeah but two's enough not to look anxious
yeah but three days is kinda the money
don't listen to him you call whenever it feels right to you
what'd you want me to do? back down? he called me a bitch we kept our rep
why?
whatever things are different here it's not like new york mikey
listen just because i was the only one with the balls to stand up to them
oh yeah like "cypress hill" was gonna do anything

good  he never doubted you
the don himself is coming to me tonight?
yes

you owe the don a service  he has no doubt that you will repay it
what do you want of me?  i'll give you anything you want but do what i ask
how do you know?
and what is that bonasera?
i ask for justice
the court gave you justice
an eye for an eye
but your daughter is still alive
then make them suffer as she suffers  how much shall i pay you
america has been good to me
then take the justice from the judge the bitter with the sweet bonasera  but if you come to me with your friendship your loyalty then your enemies become my enemies and then believe me they would fear you
good  from me you'll get justice
godfather
i really don't think i need any social advice from you right now
forgot?  you handcuffed a civilian to a tree?
i never forget a pussy cat
some day and that day may never come i would like to call upon you to do me a service in return
i want you to use all your powers all your skill as you love me  i do not want his mother to see him as he is
i'll come to you when i need you
go back to your house and wait for me
you have to answer for santino
i swear i'm innocent  i swear on the head of my children i'm innocent  mike don't do this to me please mike don't do this to me
barzini is dead  so is philip tattaglia so are strachi cuneo and moe greenei want to square all the family accounts tonight so don't tell me you're innocent; admit what you did
barzini
good good  leave now; there's a car waiting to take you to the airport
shut up
he's too wellprotected right now
your girl friend  she says she can't make it tonight  you lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number i'll kill you you bastard
ok ok  you gonna make me something to eat at least?
i'm not hungry yet
eat it it's on the table
ba fa goulle
ba fa goule you
like hell i will
yeah
the word is out in the streets that he's dead
where the hell was paulie why wasn't he with the don?
we can't just sit here austin
paulie's been a little sick all winterhe was home
how many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
maybe three four times  i always asked freddie if he wanted another bodyguard but he said no  things have been so smooth the last ten years
go get paulie i don't care how sick he is  pick him up yourself and bring him to my father's house
that's all?  don't you want me to send some people over here?
no just you and paulie
understood
okay now you can move your men into the mall replace tessio's people  mike tomorrow you take a couple of clemenza's people and go to luca's apartment and wait for him to show  that crazy bastard might be going after sollozzo right now if he's heard the news
you won't see paulie anymore  he's sick for good this winter
ok but be careful
let me tell you a story there's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below the young bull says 'hey why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?' and the wise old bull replies 'no why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
the gun will be there
you're on kidi'll square it with mom your not seeing her before you left  and i'll get a message to your girl friend when i think the time is right
we gotta move
how bad will it be?
probably all the other families will line up against us  but it's alright  these things have to happen once every ten years or sogets rid of the bad blood you gotta stop 'em at the beginning like they shoulda stopped hitler at munich they shoulda never let him get away with that they were just asking for big trouble
no i don't want to give barzini an excuse to start fighting
then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?
maybe less
what are you a dance judge?  go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood see everything is okay
the guy at the gate's outsidesays there's a package
i don't get it
sure
drive while you thinking; i wanna get to the city this month
ok go to arthur avenue; i'm suppose to call when i found somethin'
maybe or you gotta know now
holy cow i don't gotta know nothing
why do you come to me?  why do i deserve your generosity?
i need two million dollars in cashmore important i need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested they would get only light sentences  be my friend
what percentages for my family?
thirty per cent  in the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up
and what is the percentage of the tattaglia family?
well you know cows and shagging
so  i receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection  no worries about operations is that what you tell me?
if you think two million dollars in cash is just finance i congratulate you don corleone
are you worried about security for your million?
no
the tattaglias will guarantee your investment also
can i do something for you still? you're not too rich or too famous that i can't help you?
i'm not rich anymore godfather andmy career i'm almost washed up
he owns the studio  just a month ago he bought the movie rights to this book a best seller  and the main character is a guy just like me  i wouldn't even have to act just be myself
sure
it's too late  all the contracts have been signed they're almost ready to shoot
unfortunately while you told that stupid story dr evil has escaped
i'll make him an offer he can't refuse
you understand him better than anyone
the senator calledapologized for not coming personally but said you'd understand  also some of the judgesthey've all sent gifts and another call from virgil sollozzo
and with prison record
two terms; one in italy one in the united states  he's known to the government as a top narcotics man that could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify
when did he call?
this morning
on a day like this  consiglero do you also have in your notes the the turk made his living from prostitution before the war like the tattaglias do now  write that down before you forget it  the turk will wait
should i bring him in
no  let the people enjoy him  you see?  he is a good godson
no worries luv we'll just give basil a tinkle on the telling bone
it's been two years  he's probably in trouble again
they'll cut the cake in a few minutesleave right after that your new soninlaw do we give him something important?
no give him a living  but never let him know the family's business what else tom?
i've called the hospital; they've notified consiglere genco's family to come and wait  he won't last out the night
it's from johnny  it was announced this morning  he's going to play the lead in the new woltz brothers film
i didn't tell mama anything  i was about to come up and wake you and tell you  just now
but you needed a drink first
yes
now you've had your drink
mention it don't insist  barzini is a man who will know that without being told
you're crazy the camera loves you vanessa
you mean tattaglia
barzini
he was the one behind sollozzo?
tattaglia is a pimp  he could never have outfought santino  but i wasn't sure until this day  no it was barzini all along
maybe i can help
tom said he'd take care of it
for bravery
and this?
for killing a man
what miracles you do for strangers
i couldn't have another bite
i fought for my country  it was my choice
and now what do you choose to do?
i'm going to finish school
good  when you are finished come and talk to me  i have hopes for you
no
i understand michael  but you must make a family you know
i want children i want a family but i don't know when
accept what's happened michael
i could accept everything that's happened; i could accept it but that i never had a choice  from the time i was born you had laid this all out for me
no i wanted other things for you
chief  i know i screwed up  but this guy was no innocent civilian
sorry move your hand to the left there you go gorgeous
you wanted me to be your son
yes but sons who would be professors scientists musiciansand grandchildren who could be who knows a governor a president even nothing's impossible here in america
then why have i become a man like you?
you are like me we refuse to be fools to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men  i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over  that was my misfortune  that was your misfortune  i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was  i had no choice
a man has to choose what he will be i believe that
what else do you believe in?
how did you find out?
i'll need him
there are men in this world who demand to be killed  they argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender these people wander through the streets calling out "kill me kill me"  luca brasi was like that and since he wasn't scared of death and in fact looked for iti made him my weapon  because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him  i think you have done the same with this man
how?
go just go
he will get in touch with you through someone you absolutely trust  that person will arrange a meeting guarantee your safety
yes
good
nazorine my friend tell me what i can do
now that the war is over enzo this boy is being repatriated to italy  and you see godfather  hemy daughterthey
you want him to stay in this country
godfather you understand everything
tom what we need is an act of congress to allow enzo to become a citizen
an act of congress
michael why must you do this  we have been lucky so far all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret  it is from love for your father that i've asked you never to more than an hour from the villa
i'm sorry
calo and fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen
you must understand that your father's enemies have friends in palermo
i know
where are you going?
corleone
there is nothing there  not anymore
i was told that my grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old
long ago  now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettasthe others escaped to america
don tommassinoi should see this place
noi would like to walk to corleone
why?
the younger men have no respect things are changing; i don't know what will happen  michael because of the wedding people now know your name
is that why there are more men on the walls?
even so i don't think it is safe here anymore  i've made plans to move you to a villa near siracuse you must go right away
what is it?
bad news from america  your brother santino  he has been killed
how do you know i come from america?
we hear  we were told you were a pezzonovantabig shot
only the son of a pezzonovanta
hey america  is she as rich as they say?
yes
i'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die
take me to america  you need a good lupara in america?  you take me i'll be the best man you got  "oh say can you seeeeby da star early light"
shhhhh
calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen  is your wife coming with you?
no she's going home to her family she'll join me in a few weeks
this one could seduce the devil  a body and eyes as big and black as olives
i know about what you mean
this was a beauty  right calo?
beautiful all over eh?
and hair  black and curly like a doll  and such a mouth
come sunday morning:  my name is vitelli and my house is up there on the hill above the village
no this is me in a nutshell
he had business at the hotel but he'll drop in for dinner
you look good too
no
come here a minute fredo
that's for you to find out
give them some money and send them home
mike
get rid of them
i'll make him an offer he can't refuse
the don has semiretired  i'm running the family business now so anything you have to say say it to me
i am not
okay  one minute
the cops have it locked in and i got my people there visiting pop all the time  what about the hit list
if luca sold out we're in real trouble
has anyone been able to get in touch with him?
no and i've been calling all night maybe he's shacked up
luca never sleeps over with a broad he always goes home when he's through  mike keep ringing luca's number
without your father's political contacts and personal influence the corleone family loses half its strength  without your father the other new york families might wind up supporting sollozzo and the tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war  the old days are over this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore  if your father diesmake the deal sonny
that's easy to say; it's not your father
i was as good a son to him as you or mike
oh christ tom i didn't mean it that way
oh yes you are
we're all tired
ok we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead  but tom i want you to stay inside the mall you too mike no chances  tessio you hold your people in reserve but have them nosing around the city  the hospital is yours; i want it tight foolproof 24 hours a day
ok forget it just stay on the phone
sure he wants us to send mike to meet him to hear his proposition the promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse
what about that tattaglias?  what will they do about bruno?
part of the deal: bruno cancels out what they did to my father
we should hear what they have to say
no no consiglere  not this time no more meetings no more discussions no more sollozzo tricks  give them one message: i want sollozzo  if not it's all out war  we go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street
the other families won't sit still for all out war
then they hand me sollozzo
i'm not i'm the sensible one i'm always the designated driver
come on sonny your father wouldn't want to hear this  this is not a personal thing this is business
and when they shot me father
yes even the shooting of your father was business not personal
no no no more advice on how to patch it up tom  you just help me win  understood?
mccluskey can't stay with the turk forever  we'll wait
no  our informer in mccluskey's precinct  tonight at 8:00 he signed out for louis' restaurant in the bronx  anyone know it
can you do it mike?
we put out a lot of material through our contacts in the newspapersabout mccluskey's being tied up with sollozzo in the drug racketsthings are starting to loosen up
you start operating the five families will start their raids again  we're at a stalemate sonny your war is costing us a lot of money
no more stalemate tom we got the soldiers we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it they know me for what i am tom and they're scared of me
it's not that i'm drunk i'm just beginning to see what my mum was talking about  what was my mother like back in the sixties? i'm dying to know
yes  that's true you're getting a hell of a reputation
well it's war  we might not be in this shape if we had a real war time consiglere a sicilian  pop had genco who do i have?  hey tom heyhey  it's sunday we're gonna have dinner  don't be sore
i've tried calling and writing  i want to reach michael
nobody knows where he is  we know he's all right but that's all
an accident  no one was hurt
listen tom i let my cab go; can i come in to call another one?
if i accept that letter and you told a court of law i accepted it they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts just wait kay he'll contact you
mama no
sonny will come after you with everything he's got
even sonny won't be able to call off luca brasi
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine
she was very groovy she was so in love with your dad if there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your mum and treated her as well as you dad did it was me but unfortunately for yours truly that train has sailed
i'll worry about luca  you take care of sonny and the other two kids
i'll tryit's what the don would want us to do
goodthen you can go  i don't like violence  i'm a businessman and blood is a big expense
okay but just tell him this is one favor i can't give  but he should try me again on anything else
he never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first understood?
you smooth son of a bitch let me lay it on the line for you and your boss  johnny fontane never gets that movie  i don't care how many dago guinea wop greaseball goombahs come out of the woodwork
i'm germanirish
okay my krautmick friend johnny will never get that part because i hate that pinko punk and i'm going to run him out of the movies  and i'll tell you why  he ruined one of woltz brothers' most valuable proteges  for five years i had this girl under training; singing lessons  acting lessons  dancing lessons  we spent hundreds of thousands of dollarsi was going to make her a star  i'll be even more frank just to show you that i'm not a hardhearted man that it wasn't all dollars and cents  that girl was beautiful and young and innocent and she was the greatest piece of ass i've ever ad and i've had them all over the world  then johnny comes along with that olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off  she threw it all away to make me look ridiculous  a man in my position cannot afford to be made to look ridiculous
thanks tom
no  i guess i'll see you christmas everyone's going to be out at long beach right?
look at her hands baby those are carpenter's hands
right
let's say now that we have to kill mccluskey  we'll clear that up through our newspaper contacts later
tom we're going to be legitimate all the way and you're the legal man  what could be more important than that
i'm not talking about that  i'm talking about rocco lampone building a secret regime  why does neri report directly to you rather than through me or a caporegime?
not so perfectly if you noticed
mike why am i out?
you're not a wartime consigliere things may get tough with the move we're trying
ok but then i agree with tessio you're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness barzini's a wolf and if he tears you apart the other families won't come running to help the corleones
did he give you his politicians?
not alli needed another four months and i would have had them all  i guess you've figured it all out?
of course luv
how will they come at you?
i know now  i'll make them call me don
have you agreed on a meeting?
a week from tonight  in brooklyn on tessio's ground where i'll be safe
i told you i had a lot of relatives
they're waiting to see my father
they're talking to themselves
they're going to talk to my father which means they're going to ask him for something which means they better get it right
why do they bother him on a day like this?
because they know that no sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day
listen i know i'm just being neurotic but i can't shake this suspicious feeling about that italian secretary ms fagina i mean i don't want to sound paranoid but i've had some bad relationships in the past and i have some jealousy issues you went to her penthouse it makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities but i can't help but feel this weird irrational unfocused well jealousy i'm sorry
who is he?
you really want to know?
yes  tell me
you like spaghetti?
you know i love spaghetti
then eat your spaghetti and i'll tell you a luca brasi story
al capone
my father sent luca brasi after them  he tied the two capone men hand and foot and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths then he took an ax and chopped one man's feet off
michael
then the legs at the knees
don't be sorry you're right to be suspicious i shagged her i shagged her rotten
michael you're trying to scare me
then the thighs where they joined the torso
michael i don't want to hear anymore
then luca turned to the other man
michael i love you
who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated
i told you you wouldn't like him
he's coming over here
how do you do
my brother tom hagen
i can't believe you made love to her just like that did you use protection?
my brother sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid so my father took him in  he's a good lawyer
sure
i used to come down to new york whenever he sang at the capitol and scream my head off
he's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career
and what do you want for christmas?
just you
as long as i tell him beforehand he won't object  he'll be hurt but he won't object
what time do they expect us?
for dinner  unless i call and tell them we're still in new hampshire
michael
of course i had my ninemillimeter automatic
then we can have dinner see a show and spend one more night
shhh you be the long distance operator  here
hellothis is long distance  i have a call from new hampshire  mr michael corleone  one moment please

i'm thinking about it
michael

i love you
yeah kay i'm here
can you say it?
huh?
tell me you love me
please say it
look  i'll see you tonight ok?
ok 
can i go to the hospital with you?
i don't think so  you don't want to end up on page 3 of the daily news
only sailors use condoms man
my parents don't read the daily news  all right if you think i shouldn't  i can't believe the things the papers are printing i'm sure most of it's not true
i don't think so either  i better go

i want you to go back to new hampshirethink things over
goodbye
oh michael
we'll go to the show tomorrow nightwe can change the tickets

i'm busy
connie and carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy
let me think about it ok?
don't ask me
tell me
all right this one time i'll let you ask about my affairs one last time
is it true?
oh your father just had too many visitors  it interfered with the hospital service  the police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago  but don't worry  i look in on him
you just stand here one minute
end my career?
well they should filthy beggars they go from port to port  alotta meant nothing to me
you and i are going to move my father right nowto another room on another floorcan you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
absolutely not  we have to get permission from the doctor
you've read about my father in the papers  you've seen that no one's here to guard him  now i've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him  believe me and help me
we don't have to disconnect them we can wheel the stand with the bed
how's mom?
good  she's been through it before me too  you were too young to know about it  you better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear
i can help you out
oh no you can't the old man'd be sore as hell if i let you get mixed up in this
jesus christ he's my father sonny
theresa
well it means something to me if you want us to have a relationship you've got to be a onewoman man
what?
one of them fingered the old man
you're right kid clemenza is okay it was paulie
how can you be sure?
on the three days paulie was sick this month he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building  we got people in the phone company  thank god it was pauliewe'll need clemenza bad
until the old man tells me different
then wait sonny  talk to pop
sollozzo is a dead man i don't care what it costs  i don't care if we have to fight all the five families in new york  the tattaglia family's going to eat dirt  i don't care if we all go down together
that's not how pop would have played it
i know i'm not the man he was  but i'll tell you this and he'll tell you too  when it comes to real action i can operate as good as anybody short range
it was just a shag vanessa you're everything to me
all right sonny  all right
christ if i could only contact luca
is it like they say?  is he that good?
to the city
send some bodyguards
i don't need them sonny  i'm just going to see pop in the hospital also i got other things
all right get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside i'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes  sit tight and don't panic
i won't panic
cut it out
the turk wants to talk  the nerve of that son of a bitch  after he craps out last night he wants a meet
you just don't get it do you austin? good night welcome to the nineties you're going to be very lonely
the kid's right
they want me to go to the conference with sollozzo  set up the meeting for two days from now  sonny get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour  so i'll feel safe  they'll check me when i meet them so i won't be able to carry a weapon; but clemenza figure out a way to have one planted there for me  then i'll kill them both
what are you inspecting the barracks?  you ready?  did clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
a million times
sollozzo and mccluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on times square under the big camels sign
probably a year
i want to settle things tonight  i want my father left alone
he won't be; i swear to you be my children he won't be  just keep an open mind when we talk  i hope you're not a hothead like your brother sonny  it's impossible to talk business with him
maybe
what guarantees can i give you?  i am the hunted one  i've missed my chance  you think too highly of me my friendi am not so cleverall i want if a truce
thirty years of political and social upheaval the fall of the berlin wall a female prime minister of england the abolishment of apartheid a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang
is it all right if i go to the bathroom?
yes i promise
i do renounce him
and all his works?
i do renounce them
i do wish to be baptized
just be patient
i'm not asking you for help mike just take off the handcuffs
be patient
no  i want things very calm for another six months
yeah i can't believe liberace was gay women loved him man i didn't see that one coming
forgive me godfather let our years of friendship be my excuse how can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  the two  go hand in hand and with you gone from here the barzini and the tattaglias will be too strong for us
he talked to you?
i can arrange security
thanks
the chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good  draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house
is my credit good enough to buy you out?
the hotel the casino  the corleone family wants to buy you out
your casino loses money  maybe we can do better
you think i scam?
you're unlucky
basil was very concerned to know where you were last night
you goddamn dagos  i do you a favor and take freddie in when you're having a bad time and then you try to push me out
you took freddie in because the corleone family bankrolled your casino  you and the corleone family are evened out  this is for business; name your price
the corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore  the godfather is sick  you're getting chased out of new york by barzini and the other families and you think you can find easier pickings here  i've talked to barzini; i can make a deal with him and keep my hotel
is that why you thought you could slap freddie around in public?
hell he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time  players couldn't get a drink
you son of a bitch you think you can brush me off like that?  i made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders
do you recognize my voice?
i think so  detective squad?
right  don't say my name just listen  somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago
is he alive?
out and about doing odds and sods
i think so but i can't get close enough  there's a lot of blood i'll try to find out more
find out anything you canyou got a grand coming 
what are you doing in mongi?
sure any time
and be careful in the sun your gray's in danger of turning a little pink

it's the one task dickie can do on his own  make coffee
shut up
how are you going to fight this?  maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight  you'd have the good to weight against the bad it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do  gimme your shield
who?
oh darling  is that for me?
no it's for tom as he didn't complain

i feel like he's here horrible like the old bastard is here right now that's brilliant how do you know him?
i met him in new york
i'm looking at you and the whole time i can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchiekooch
marge you've got to hear this
what?
i'd pay you if you would go to italy and persuade my son to come home i'd pay you $1000
no i think your mother her illness 
it's got nothing to do with my mother she's had leukemia for   this is what makes me boil about him he wants me back  it's got nothing to do with my mother
i don't know dickie i'm just telling you what i 
go back go back to new york or call him if you can find a telephone that works and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard
i love jazz
this is the best marge says she likes jazz but she things glenn miller is jazz
i don't know what's the name of your sailboat?
don't worry baby i picked up a mind control technique during my travels to india i learned it from my guru the late guru shastri a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis  just watch me watch me now
bird
what time is it?  oh god do you always type your letters?  that should be two ts
i can't write and i can't spell that's the privilege of a firstclass education you're upstairs at the back i think ermelinda made the bed up
this is so good of you
don't say it again now you're a double agent and we're going to string my dad along i was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you what do you think marge a little cinquecento with my dad's money?
your parents met her
oh god  i can just imagine  if only dickie would settle down doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? never i swear on your ring marge i am never going back
you're doing great we'll make a sailor of you yet you're doing really well
sure i love venice
i have to go to venice
yes act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in vanessa
see venice and die isn't that right? or is it rome? you do something and die don't you? okay venice is on the list
and rome
do you ski?  don't tell me  you're a lost cause that's the next thing to deal with we're planning to go to cortina at christmas excellent skiing excellent  marge  ripley can't ski we'll have to teach him that too have you ever known such low class?
what?
you're breaking my ribs
i played piano in a few places
that's one job you told me a lot of jobs
a few places  that's a few jobs anyway i don't want to think about new york
the mysterious mr ripley marge and i spend hours speculating  cold beer thank you dad
copy out from here
not now austin
no i've got more than one shirt
she can do that stuff for you anyway just wear some of my things wear anything you want most of it's ancient 
now your signature  not "dickie" your signature
like clark kent  now superman
pretty vile see this: the s and the t do you see?  fine vulnerable  that's pain that's secret pain
it must be a deep secret cause i don't know about it
your handwriting  nothing more naked see  nothing's quite touching the line  that's vanity
well we certainly know that's true
no no brothers no sisters
me neither nor does marge all only children  what does that mean?
sadly no hold on i always keep this on me just in case
no
i didn't mean with you in it
okay you get in i'm like a prune anyway
he's getting impatient he wants me to reassure him you'll be home by thanksgiving
you've got to get a new jacket really you must be sick of the same clothes i'm sick of seeing you in them
i can't i can't keep spending your father's money
i love how responsible you are my dad should make you chief accountant or something let me buy you a jacket there's a great place when we get to rome batistoni
relax
it's just there's so much to do in a single day
relax the most important question is where to eat i hope freddie made a reservation
no no no we'll use the floss to get to the ledge
freddie?
freddie miles you know  he's organizing the cortina skiing trip
what club?
freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd come if you want but i thought you wanted to see the forum?
i did and then maybe get the jacket and what have you
you said i could pick out a jacket and i just sorry
get undressed in your own room would you?
i thought you'd missed the train
freddie drove me back in his car
is freddie here?
smashing idea give it to me
he's downstairs
i was just fooling around don't say anything sorry
i don't know why are you asking me?  how can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
i'm prepared to take the blame
what are you talking about?
you've been so good to me you're the brother i never had i'm the brother you never had
she came to me for help she needed money and i didn't help her i didn't help her now she's dead and it's my fault
i'm not going to say anything  to marge or anybody the police  it's a secret between us and i'll keep it
you can't blame him you could hardly expect this to go on forever
i thought you might write again now that we're brothers
but chief?  over this??
indeed
i can't how can i in all decency? we've had a good run haven't we?
what about venice? can we stick to that plan at least?
i don't think so tom you can't stay on here without money it's time we all moved on besides i'm sick of mongi especially now with everything  i really want to move to the north i need to check out san remo next week find somewhere new to keep the boat but it would be great though if you came with me our last trip before you leave there's a jazz festival  we could say goodbye in style what do you think? a last trip?
to mongi you're cheerful tonight
i'm suddenly quite happy to be going back
that's good
i've got plans
ripley's plans
esatto i'm always planning
did i know you at princeton tom? i didn't did i?
that's not the way to get ahead in life
why are you asking all of a sudden?
no reason because you're leaving i guess i don't think you were there were you?
why?
i mean it as a compliment you've got such great taste i don't know most of the thugs at princeton had tasted everything and had no taste used to say the cream of america: rich and thick freddie's the perfect example
then i'll take it as a compliment
i knew it i had a bet with marge
ha
do you even like jazz  or was that something for my benefit?
i've gotten to like it i've gotten to like everything about the way you live it's one big love affair if you knew my life back home in new york
what?
yes
so cool
so tell me
i thought i might come back in the new year under my own steam
really? to italy?
of course let's say for argument's sake you were here  perhaps we could split the rent on a house  i'll get a job  or better still i could get a place in rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here 
oh god i don't think so
you see particularly with the marge problem you can just blame me
marge and i are getting married
how?
how?
it's a shame he wasn't more headstrong
yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace today you're getting married it's absurd
i love marge
you love me and you're not marrying me
tom i don't love you
no no it's not a threat i've explained all of that
i'm actually a little relieved you're going to be honest i think we've seen enough of each other for a while
you can be a leech  you know this  and it's boring you can be quite boring
the funny thing  i'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are i'm absolutely honest with you i've told you my feelings but you first of all i know there's something  that evening when we played chess for instance it was obvious 
what evening?
sure  i know that's too dangerous for you fair enough hey we're brothers fine then you do this sordid thing with marge fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen which was excruciating frankly plus you follow your cock around like a  and now you're getting married i'm bewildered forgive me you're lying to marge then getting married to her you're knocking up silvana you've got to play sax you've got to play drums which is it dickie what do you really play?
shut up
ciao bello  don't you want to fuck every woman you see just once
hey if i'm late think what her husband's saying
listen just take one of mine when we get back don't worry about it i did the forum with marge and frankly once is enough in anyone's life
i don't think so come back with me to rome there's this great new club have some drinks lotta ladies
sure
just point her at capri and avoid the rocks
what are you doing?
margemaintenance
aye aye
dickie?
fair enough
who is it?
it's freddie let me in
oh hello where's dickie? how are you?
yes i'm good thank you dickies at dinner he's at otello's do you know it?
i don't think he's at dinner at 630pm if you said he was still at lunch i'd believe you incredible the guy has disappeared off the face of the earth
i guess
the landlady  as far as i could tell the landlady said he was here right now
he's gone to dinner search the place i can't think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you
because he's been hiding from me  what happened at christmas?
what about christmas?
we've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag  you go get help i'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad doctor
he was supposed to come skiing i didn't get a cable or a call or a note or frankly a fart
which is horseshit have you heard him play that thing?  he can't
how did you find him? it's such an out of the way apartment can i fix you a drink?
no thanks  some kid at the american express office  are you living here?
did this place come furnished? it doesn't look like dickie horrible isn't it?  so bourgeois
in fact the only thing which looks like dickie is you
hardly
have you done something to your hair?
what? i think i'm saying it something's going on he's either converted to christianity  or to something else
i suggest you ask dickie that yourself otello's is on delle croce just off the corso
i'm not going anywhere we're a team
is it on "delle croce just off the corso"? you're a quick study aren't you? last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow now you're giving me directions that's not fair you probably do know your ass from your elbow i'll see you
tom ripley thank you sir
i see you were at princeton then you'll most likely know our son dick dickie greenleaf
i've always wanted to go to europe sir but
good now you can go for a reason
tom how are you? you look well
i'm well thank you
far cry from new york
yes it is
marge good morning unusual weather
too right youth that's why i need you to lead the troops
he's being thorough that's all i'm learning about my son tom now he's missing i'm learning a great deal about him i hope you can fill in some more blanks for me marge has been good enough to do that about mongibello
i'll try my best sir obviously i'll do anything to help dickie
i think it might hurt her to know
and his passport photo? did you hear? to scratch out your own face like that  can you imagine  the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  i've thought about going to the police but i can't face it i can't face anything anymore
i feel guilty i feel like i pushed him away i spoke and he heard you
well if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? you've been a great friend to my son everything is someone else's fault we all want to sow wild oars somebody's got to  what's the word?  the moment someone confronts him he lashes out he lashes out you know people always say you can't choose your parents but you can't choose your children
hello sir  marge you should have waited didn't peter tell you i'd come by and pick you up?
marge has been telling us about the rings
you know i feel ridiculous i didn't mention them yesterday  i clean forgot  ridiculous
perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn
i'll hurry back
we could go down to the bar  no need for you to 
no he should talk to you alone
where's mr maccarron?
san remo the police are amateurs well my boy it's come to a pretty pass hasn't it?
i just don't believe that
you don't want to dear i'd like to talk to tom alone  perhaps this afternoon? would you mind? marge what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow 
such as?
what a waste of lives and opportunities and 
marge there's female intuition and then there are facts 
can you bear it? we hear you're a friend of freddie's  he has i hate opera tattooed on his chest
there's nothing to talk about  get a good lawyer  you're suspended until your trial
listen vanessa whatever happens i just want you to know that i feel bad about shagging that italian girl i had a sip of sake and all of the sudden i don't know what happened the whole time i was shagging her i mean really shagging her i mean it was crazy i was like a huge mechanical piston in and out in and out
there's room for a whole libretto on freddie's chest
i'm sure we've met
thanks yes i think we did
one minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed
mr ripley? i'm alvin maccarron
i don't care for bs i don't care to hear it i don't care to speak it
okay
why do you think dickie's father sent him to europe in the first place? did you know at princeton dickie greenleaf halfkilled a boy?
i hope she never knows
three different people saw dickie get into freddie miles' car a man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw dickie removing license plates from a red sports car the police know about this man because he happens to be a policeman
austin what's your point?
what's going on?
hello tom you're off? what are your plans?
back i suppose slowly as i can
bird that's jazz
he's not a man he's a god
i absolutely agree with marge
tom i love you  see  i bought it for him for his birthday
it's superb
frances?
i'm fine
anyways what i'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a onewoman man well that's just groovy because i love you
sure
so i'm learning
he's not even aware of it when you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world that's why everybody loves him other times
what about cortina?
didn't dick say?  he talked to freddie apparently it's not going to work out   freddie says there aren't enough rooms
i'll go and see what's the matter
i'll go
tom you startled me you're back
how are you? sorry is your book going well?
yes  i'm on a good streak thanks
oh behave
i was just looking at you   so quiet
where's dickie?
i think he's planning on staying in rome for a few days
ha did he say why?
i don't know i don't understand dickie marge so your guess is as good as mine
what does that mean?
well one day i'm invited skiing the next day i'm not one day we're all one family the next day he wants to be alone you tell me
is that what he said  he wanted to be alone?
he was thinking of you marge  he asked me to deliver this
errand number one  deliver marge's perfume errand number two pack some clothes and his precious saxophone
likewise
how long's he staying for?
search me i guess we're abandoned
i think you're right
marge how are you? what are you doing in rome?
is he here? are you with dickie?
no  hello i'm tom ripley
marge you know dickie has i hate opera tattooed on his chest
you were going to venice
i don't believe it wild horses wouldn't drag dickie to 
he was there with someone so i suppose she must have dragged him  that's not fair i'm going back to mongi i think dickie's coming home  i'm going to go home
i can explain they attacked me gas came out of herwell and then they and i
really? that's swell no i was just  you're way ahead of me great
marge when did you get here?
tell me the truth did he kill freddie?
i'd swear he didn't of course he didn't
i tried again waiting here watching for him instead it's you whenever i look for dickie i find you  what happened to your face?
dickie did it
dickie?
my face there was an argument i said some things i shouldn't have about you about the appalling way he's treating you all of us and the next thing i know he's launched himself at me  are you getting on?
what?
get on i'll take you to him
i believe you austin let's go
we passed it a few blocks back where the police were the palazzo gioia they don't even know i'm in rome and i'm not going to incriminate dickie 
perhaps i shouldn't go either
no well go if you want to but don't talk to the police about my face  they find out he hit me  he's got a temper  he could've hit freddie  good luck marge i'll catch up with you later
hello marge
tom
dickie hasn't killed himself i'm sure of that there's a private detective on the case now  a mr maccarron  dickie's father's employing him
that's a terrific idea
he's american he's already discovered dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared
to the manner born
and you sir? any better?
hold on a tick let me put on my togs
he's having an early night
poor man  we were knocking on that door for ever  i think i've broken my strap
marge i'm in the bath won't be long
tom i need to talk to you it's urgent
what?
you've got dickie's rings
i can explain
let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this
i have to tell mr greenleaf i have to tell mr greenleaf i have to tell mr greenleaf
marge calm down you're being hysterical
are you crazy?
he promised me i swear i'll never take off this ring until the day 
shut up shut up
i was looking for a needle and thread i wasn't snooping i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra
the scent you're wearing i bought it for you not dickie the thing about dickie so many things the day he was late back from rome  i tried to tell you this  he was with another girl i'm not talking about meredith another girl we met in a bar he couldn't be faithful for five minutes so when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise or i do he has so many realities dickie and he believes them all he lies he lies that's his half the time he doesn't even realize
why do you have dickie's rings?
why? when?
i feel as if you haven't heard anything i've been saying to you
i don't believe you
it's all true
i don't believe a single word you've said
don't worry
what are you going to do now tom?
i don't know peter has a concert in athens next month  and he's asked if i want to go along help out he says goodbye by the way  he's in rehearsal otherwise 
why do i think there's never been a ripley rainy day?
what?
i know it was you  i know it was you tom i know it was you i know you killed dickie i know it was you
oh marge
you were at the opera? well that explains  yes i was there i was there with dickie
i told you i knew it
marge i don't know you so i have no right but dickie loves you he's  i think you'll find he's coming home to you
how would you know that?
yeah right
i'm going it alone this time vanessa i have a followup visit with the evil doctor
he told me everything i was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago so i i'm going to go now i think unless he meant us to meet  which would be a little cruel wouldn't it?
no glasses
i don't know her  he hasn't called he's hardly written just these cryptic notes you don't just dump people
do you know tom?
i hope so
that was moving wasn't it? when meredith said   meredith's the american girl i saw last night i know her at the opera she's been seeing something of dickie 
i think we sort of found each other
he's not coming till the morning evidently his stomach  i don't think the food here is agreeing with him
no it's tom's splendid eh?
golly who's paying for this?
i'll secure the perimeter
that's why tom wanted you to stay it's better than squeezing into my room and i know how you hate hotels
a hotel would've been fine  we'll have to tell mr greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched
no nothing i'm just thinking about when tom arrived in mongi  and now look at you
excuse me?
no it's just  you are american aren't you?  no i just i have so much luggage and you're so uh streamlined it's humiliating
dickie dickie greenleaf hello
hello
trying not to be trying to jump ship
so now did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? it's just  upstairs  weren't you under the r stand? i thought i saw you there
my father wants me in new york he builds boats i'd rather sail them i travel under my mother's name

how did you know that?
i love you austin
everybody knows freddie miles
is freddie in rome?
now? i don't think so but i've met him of course and we've chatted and i know about you and marge and mongi and what an unreliable rat you are freddie said you were a rat and i thought to myself now i know why he travels under r
i've left marge meredith and mongi so the rat's here now in rome
sorry i wouldn't have made a joke if 
don't be sorry i've never been happier i feel like i've been handed a new life
i know
i've never admitted that to anyone
i'll take them both
i thought you were enjoying yourself?
that's fab because i love you too vanessa
let's take a carozza and look at the moon

you're such a pal to understand it's as if marge is here now  i look at you and i see her face  and i can't whatever i'm feeling towards you  i just can't
no i absolutely understand of course
otherwise you'd be fighting me off
beating you away
oh meredith i'm sorry of course i'll meet you let's have coffee in the morning at dinelli's
i don't  is that by the spanish steps?
exactly 1030  
kiss me
hello meredith
i was looking at you your clothes i wouldn't have known you
well you've spotted me and so you get the reward
what?
just kidding are you alone?
hardly i couldn't be less alone
and co a lot of co oh god i've thought about you so much
i've thought about you
i haven't been hiding i've been in police custody they've been trying to flush out freddie's killer
you're kidding
behave
they're letting me have this vacation which is why the getup which is why you haven't heard from me
you know the whole world thinks you killed freddie? it's terrible
i know look i can't talk now later later?
you know what  i am
dickie are you with peter smith kingsley? i bet you are my aunt thought she saw him
peter smithkingsley? i haven't seen him in months no i'm alone 
he's taken over the case because they're annoyed the previous chap let dickie disappear when he was the only he was the only suspect in freddie's murder
quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor ripley ha visto il signor greenleaf? 
where have you been since then?
he thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside
actually my name's austin powers
il signor ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
are you a homosexual?  interesting nonsequitur
a ragione a ragione 
hmm c'e questa 
they found this in dickie's place in rome
where are you hiding him? he's impossible isn't he?
i am i really am and i've been travelling i just can't seem to get that far north
well hurry before we sink  should i give you my telephone number in venice?
thanks
i can't later
it says here name danger powers
and tomorrow?
tomorrow's possible do you know dinelli's? piazza di spagna?
i know the piazza di spagna what time?
ten thirty?
we'll be there
okay marge see you tomorrow  it's really good to meet you
not at all morning tom
hi  sorry you okay? you look as if you've seen a ghost
but the point is dickie  well we know this  dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses
it's fantastic  i feel guilty marge doesn't understand this but anytime dickie does something i feel guilty
danger's my middle name
don't be daft it's fine i'm delighted you finally made it to venice i'm delighted contrary to rumour you're still in one piece?
what rumour?
that dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport i know ridiculous
it's okay
anyway i've got to the bottom of the delay finally we're waiting for someone from rome
what do you mean? they're sending someone from rome?
that's good isn't it?
no but i thought that didn't happen in italy that each region was completely separate i was sure that was the 
you've seen the papers you know what a big deal it's been here american tourist murdered 
it's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench i can hardly breathe
what was that korfin?
ok austin danger powers: one blue crushedvelvet suit one frilly lace cravat one gold medallion with peace symbol one pair of italian shoes one pair of tiedyed socks purple one vinyl recording album: tom jones live at las vegas one swedishmade penis enlarger pump
a roma circa tre settimane fa
i don't know how to translate that  e difficile il signor ripley dormiva all'aperto con un
no  by the way officially there are no italian homosexuals makes leonardo michelangelo very inconvenient
no i did not i did not kill freddie miles and then kill dickie greenleaf is he accusing me?  ask him if he's accusing me
he's already angry i don't think 
just because he doesn't like americans
whatever you do however terrible however hurtful  it all makes sense doesn't it? inside your head you never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel
but you're still tormented you must be you've killed somebody
don't you put the past in a room in the cellar and lock the door and just never go in there? because that's what i do
probably in my case it's probably a whole building
that's not mine
then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key say open up step inside but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was
no key huh?
you look ghastly tom are you okay?
i'll fix some drinks
i'm fine
do you want me to stick around?
it's okay
or i could come back
you try you try talking to her
tom tom tell me what's going on?
one credit card receipt for swedish made penis enlarger pump signed austin powers
i give up
what do you want to change about this moment?
nothing
all kinds of things making plans
plans  good plans for tonight or plans for the future?
i don't know both my plan right now is to go up on deck look at the sunset come with me
you go i don't want to get dressed yet come back though come back  you know you look so relaxed like a completely different person
well that's entirely your fault and if i fall overboard that'll be your fault too
good but i think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip
was that meredith?
i'm telling you baby that's not mine
was who meredith?
meredith logue you were kissing somebody looked like meredith
hardly kissing kissing off
didn't look that way  you know  from a distance
i lied to her she thought she'd seen you
why lie?
dickie and peter that's just too good gossip isn't it?
or tom and peter even
well that would be even better gossip
really why?  sorry i'm completely lost
one warranty card for swedishmade penis enlarger pump filled out by austin powers
i know i'm lost too i'm going to be stuck in the basement aren't i that's my that's my  terrible and alone and dark  and i've lied about who i am and where i am and so nobody can ever find me
what do you mean lied about who you are?
i suppose i always thought  better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody
what are you talking about  you're not a nobody that's the last thing you are
peter i i
and don't forget i have the key
you have the key tell me some good things about tom ripley don't get up just tell me some nice things
you're such a liar
tom is a mystery
yes?
i don't even know what this is this sort of thing ain't my bag baby
inspector roverini can we come in?
i can't be absolutely sure  8? 9? we'd both taken on far too many drinks  but it was dark it was certainly dark when i walked him down to his car
so signor miles drove away and you did what?
i went to bed freddie's a big man but i'm in trouble after a couple of drinks i've suffered all day who found him?
yes if it's going to help certainly
so the doctor he has to make the    come se dice?
postmortem?
yes exactly but his first his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening
well he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car
no
one book: swedishmade penis enlarger pumps and me: this sort of thing is my bag baby by austin powers
of course what happened to your face?
my scooter i fell off getting chased by photographers
what about thomas ripley?
what about ripley?
november i thought
was it? did you speak to tom?
november 7th is my information
i don't remember the exact date
and when did you last see signor ripley?
a few days ago
sure
does he stay with you here?
no
no here is a pattern two days ago freddie miles is dead  he leaves your apartment and is murdered yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november 7th we look at hotel records and we see oh dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat
it's not a pattern it's a coincidence there must be fifty hotels in san remo there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day
31 people
31 people
let her in what's the difference? let her in  no actually no i'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later
do you have a photograph of signor ripley?
i'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends
now i think i have upset you my english perhaps is coarse
hey wait a minute
it is a little coarse yes
sorry no one has seen signor ripley since san 
i have
you have yes
no i have and so has miss sherwood ask her and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at  the goldoni  tom was staying at the goldoni
good the goldoni yes  you're right a coincidence  i look forward to our next meeting when i will be more careful with my english and persuade you to play me your saxophone alto
absolutely
i have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into mr miles' car she wants to identify you in a  confronto  lineup  tomorrow then?
tomorrow
that's an expensive gun
here have a piece of gum
i got money
i want a 32 revolver and a palm gun that 22 there
that's the colt 25  a fine little gun don't do a lot of damage but it's as fast as the devil handy little gun you can carry it almost anywhere i'll throw it in for another $125
the 32's $150  and you're really getting a good deal now  and all together it comes to ah seven eighty five for four pieces and a holster hell i'll give you the holster we'll make it seventyfive and you've got a deal  a good one
how much to get a permit to carry?
well you're talking big money now i'd say at least five grand maybe more and it would take a while to check it out the way things are going now $5000 is probably low you see i try not to fool with the smalltime crap too risky too little bread say 6 g's but if i get the permit it'll be as solid as the empire state building
nah this'll be fine
you can't carry in a cab even with a permit  so why bother?
is there a firing range around?
sure here take this card go to this place and give 'em the card they'll charge you but there won't be any hassle
i said yeah you're right chief  as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media
hey wait a minute that's my last piece of gum
huh?
vietnam? i saw it on your jacket where were you? bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there
it's hell out there all right a real shiteatin' war i'll say this though: it's bringing a lot of fantastic guns the market's flooded colt automatics are all over 
they'd never get me to go back they'd have to shoot me first  you got anything to carry these in? 
huh?
i can get you front and center what do you like? i can get you mets knicks rangers? hell i can get you the mayor's box
nah i ain't interested

charles palantine the man you want to volunteer to help elect president
oh i think he's a wonderful man make a great great president
no no i want you to have it even if it's my last piece
you want to canvass?
yes mam
i'm a good worker betsy mam a real good worker
if you talk to tom he'll assign you to something
if you don't mind mam i'd rather work for you
well we're all working tonight
well betsy mam i drive a taxi at night
well then what is it you exactly want to do?
if you don't mind mam i'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me
well betsy mam i drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day and i watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones and i say to myself that's a lonely girl she needs a friend and i'm gonna be her friend 
i'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert
it's just to the corner mam in broad daytime nothing can happen i'll be there to protect you
all right  all right i'm taking a break at four o'clock if you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie
oh i appreciate that betsy mam i'll be here at four o'clock exactly  and ah betsy
yes?
my name is travis
thank you travis
i know what you mean i've got the same problems i just can't get things organized little things i mean like my room my possessions i should get one of those signs that says "one of these days i'm gonna get organezizied"
i can believe that
where do you live?
oh uptown you know some joint it ain't much
where did you learn to shoot?
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
i had a regular job for a while days you know doin' this doin' that but i didn't have anything to do at night i got kinda lonely you know just wandering around so i decided to works nights it ain't good to be alone you know
after this job i'm looking forward to being alone for a while
yeah well  in a cab you get to meet people you meet lotsa people it's good for you
what kind of people?
just people people you know just people  had a dead man once
really?
he'd been shot i didn't know that he just crawled into the back seat said "west 45th street" and conked out
what did you do?
i shut the meter off for one thing i knew i wasn't going to get paid then i dropped him off at the cop shop they took him
is it one of ours?
that's really something
oh you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab especially when the moon's out
the moon?
the full moon one night i had three or four weirdos in a row and i looked up and sure enough there it was  the full moon
i know i could have picked you up
huh?
late one night about three at the plaza
three in the morning? i don't think so i have to go to bed early i work days it must have been somebody else
no it was you you had some manila folders and a pink bag from saks
if it wasn't for a drunk i would have picked you up he wanted to go to the dmz
no log com bird twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy not stealthy not carbon composite  it does have an odd shape sir
the dmz?
south bronx the worst i tried to ditch him but he was already in the cab so i had to take him that's the law otherwise i would have picked you up
that would have been quite a coincidence
you'd be surprised how often you see the same people get the same fare people have patterns they do more or less the same things every day i can tell
well i don't go to the plaza every night
i didn't mean you but just ordinary people a guy i know  doughboy  met his wife that way they got to talking she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop taking her home with the flag up
that's very romantic some of your fares must be interesting see any stars politicians deliver any babies yet?
well no not really had some famous people in the cab  i got this guy who makes lasers not regular lasers not the big kind little lasers pocket sized small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio like a gun you know like a ray gun zap
what hours do you work?
i work a single which means there's no replacement  no second man on the cab six to six sometimes eight seventytwo hours a week
what are you saying son?
you mean you work seventytwo hours a week
sometimes 76 or 80 sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning eighty miles a day a hundred miles a night
you must be rich
it keeps ya busy
you know what you remind me of?
what?
that song by kris kristofferson where it's said "like a pusher party truth partly fiction a walking contradiction" 
i'm no pusher betsy honest i never have pushed
i didn't mean that travis just the part about the contradiction
oh who was that again?
it appears to be in the shape of bob's big boy sir
the singer?
yeah yes i don't follow music too much
kris kristofferson
he'll what else can i do with it all?
yeah well my stereo player is broke but i'm sure the record is ok
your stereo broke? god i could hardly stand that i live on music
i don't follow music much i'd like to though  honest
so you haven't heard this record yet?
no  i thought maybe you could play it for me on your player
i bought a couple of tickets
in many ways bob's big boy never left sir he's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices
but this is a porno movie
no these are the kind that couples go to they're not like the other movies all kinds of couples go honest i've seen them
what's wrong?
i forgot to get the cocacola
i'm leaving
what do you mean?
well i don't follow movies too much
you mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
i mean porno movies
well mostly
shut up
my god
we can go to another movie if you like i don't care i got money there's plenty
no travis you're a sweet guy and all that but i think this is it i'm going home
you mean you don't want to go to a movie?  there's plenty of movies around here
no i don't feel so good we're just two very different kinds of people that's all
huh?
it's very simple you go your way i'll go mine thanks anyway travis
but betsy
i'm getting a taxi
keep it
you're welcome
you do that wiseguy  now let's solve this thing before eddie flemming does
should we scramble tachq for an intercept?
can i call you?
hello betsy
yes it won't be long now seventeen days
well i hope he wins
oh i got over that it was nothing really the papers always blow these things up  a little stiffness that'll go away i just sleep more that's all
thank you travis
yeah
maybe i'll see you again sometime huh?
sure
the senator's white paper is almost ready bets should we wait for that?
what's its current position?
andy usually just sends those to the national media the local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program push the issues
first push the man then the issue senator palantine is first of all a dynamic man an intelligent interesting fascinating man
you forgot "sexy"
no i didn't forget "sexy"
just didn't get around to it huh?
oh tom please
well for christsakes you sound like you're selling i don't know what cars not issues
have you ever wondered why cbs news has the highest ratings?
more people watch it
that's a direct order you didn't see a thing
alright forget it if you're not going to be serious
no c'mon i'm listening i was just
just what?
kidding around you know fun
with who?
alright now you want to know why cbs has the highest ratings? you think their news is any different from nbc abc? it's all the same news same stories same order usually what you thought they had good news for people right? you thought that's why people watched cbs? i'll tell you why people watch cbs cronkite the man you got it? not the news not the issues the man if walter cronkite told people to eat soap they'd do it we are selling cars goddamn it
that's the last the finish period some people can learn some people can't and you wonder why we never get serious 
sure we could run him you realize he's already head of his block association
have you been noticing anything strange?
no why?
can't you see i'm only half a man? look at me i'm a freak
why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
what taxi driver?
that taxi driver the one that's been sitting here
how long has he been there?
i don't know  but it feels like a long time
this is gotta be a game right?
this i gotta see
ouch
oh are you all right?
i'm great always set my fingers on fire if you want to see another trick i do this thing with my nose
and look what you've done to mr bigglesworth
no i just wanted to see if you could light it that way the guy at the newsstand can
ah yes the guy at the newsstand mr asbestos
he happens to be missing fingers i first noticed when 
is he italian?
no why?
you sure he's not italian?
he's black ok?
well if he had been italian they could have been shot off sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson if they blow a job or something
as i said he isn't italian besides i thought they just killed them
don't be naive they can't kill everybody they have different punishments for different things like if they kill a stool pigeon they leave a canary on the body it's symbolic
silence
why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
i don't know maybe they don't leave a canary don't be technical what i'm saying is if this newsstand guy's italian and his fingers are gone maybe he's a thief
first he's not italian second he's not a thief i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change  the right change two of his fingers are missing just stubs like they were blown away i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette i couldn't help watching i was dying to see how he'd light it
with the other hand right?
no stupid with the stubs that's the whole point
i know that guy his hand looks like a paw an old black guy the newsstand at 
no this is young  well i'm never sure how old black people are  but anyway he isn't old that's for sure
show me how he did that again
what is it? i'm busy
just follow me
let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure
now look more closely look around the eyes and chin see? see there?
awh come off it pal
no i'm serious really
ya want me to call da boss? huh? that what you want?
no no it's alright i'll have a big cocacola  without ice  and a large buttered popcorn and  some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls and jujukes a box they last
we don't have jujukes we don't have cocacola we only got royal crown cola
that's fine
that's a dollar fortyseven
not rouge blushon they call it
the kind with a brush
someone help me i'm still alive only i'm very badly burned
ask travis he's the ladies man
no
could you see anything?
well she was trying to keep her skirt down sort of you know but it was pretty obvious what she was doing i mean christ it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still
what did you do?
threw on the emergency jumped the seat and fucked her brains out  what do you think  what do i have to do? draw you a picture?
yeah
what was i supposed to do? i was watching in the rear view you know just checkin' traffic  so howsit?
you said that?
well i said "lady please we're on a bridge"
some of you i know some of you i'm meeting for the first time
and what happened?
a real skunk
we call him doughboy cause he likes the dollars he'll chase a buck straight into jersey
look who's talking?  who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
fuckin' mau mau land that's what it is
the cops and company raise hell they find out
for a fee
for a fee
i never use mine but it's a good thing to have just as a threat

didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
at least i don't walk the streets like a skunk pussy i don't screw and fuck with killers and junkies
that fella "sport" looks like a killer to me
he never killed nobody he's a libra

god i know where they should have a commune for you they should have a commune for you at bellevue
i'm sorry iris i didn't mean that
you're not much with girls are you?
well iris i look at it this way a lot of girls come into my cab some of them very beautiful and i figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them talk to them ask them out and they hate it so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all so i don't say a thing i pretend i'm not even there i figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it
thank you herr doctor

oh yes  yes he was
the details of my life are quite inconsequential
well let me tell you i'm not luke  i know who i am now and you don't  and i don't like me very much
you know it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete  pete  pete  it's a nice name
thanks i like it  i think
the truth is i'm a lot of things but communist isn't one of them
but if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care? besides why should it even matter if you were a communist?
come on delly look at the country today  we're fighting communists in korea we're paranoid about the russians we've got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb  you think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the american public with party propaganda like gosh i don't know "sand pirates of the sahara?"
forget about all that  you want to do the right thing?  then defend your name  if someone says something about you that's untrue you have to stand up and say so  i know the law and the law's on your side
i am too
whatever happens
yeah  except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact
that's not true doctor please tell us about your childhood
you'll be fine  no matter what leo kubelsky says you've got a hundred and seventyfive years of american law on your side  don't forget that
i wish you were coming with me
and who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  mrs terwilliger?
maybe we could train cat to run the projector  you know a system of scratching posts and gears and levers
damn
delly thanks thank you  i'll take good care of this
just remember two things  first the law is a living thing  it made us free and it keeps us free sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes sometimes it makes mistakes sometimes big mistakes  but in the end the law prevails for the just sometimes it takes a while
okay  what's the second thing?
mr chairman as i understand it the fifth amendment pertains to selfincrimination and i can't incriminate myself because i've done nothing wrong  besides incrimination is why you have mr clyde working for you
pete i'm so sorry about what they did to you  i didn't think you'd come back i thought you'd want to write again
hello scott i'm your father dr evil  i have a son i have a son everyone i have a son  someday scott this will all be yours
dell i can't write unless i'm happy and i can't be happy unless i'm here  and with you  this is me delly  pete appleton and i love you
and  i love you pete
delly?  in here
not as bad as i thought it would i think i passed
that's my girl  did you?
no hiccups which was good  who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "your  honor i  object"
that always used to work
yeah well it's not everyday you get  news like this  you're sure he's  okay?  other than the  bump on the head?
well
dad 
i haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? i hate you
 including me  right?  
i'm afraid not  he looked right at your picture without batting an eye  but it's probably temporary he got all the way to lawson so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head i'm sure it'll all come back to him  it just takes a catalyst
you mean  me?
it's possible
honey i i can't it's the
i had it a minute ago
i've seen you before  your picture
no i i just wondering where you've been all this time
me too
you look different
not me
i do?
yeah a little  i think you grew an inch or so  and you've lost weight
i did?  huh
go on home folks  and thanks for the welcome
well where can we go?
you must not remember anything come on
why me?
be a gentleman  you have to help me down
how'd they get it inside?
through the door  it comes apart
vodka tonic
no maybe like work in a petting zoo or something
it doesn't seem right this being down here  it ought to be where people can see it
after they commissioned it no one could ever agree on where to put it  the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall  everyone finally got tired of the fighting  so they stuck it down here
and why not?
whoa
sorry  you don't know how many times i've heard that  "a lady lawyer?  are you crazy?"  like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man  or better in fact
have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
you don't remember but yes ever since i was a little girl
what did what did i want to be?
oh well i guess you in high school you were a pretty good first baseman  and we were on the debate team together  but i think you were gonna run the bijou you were brought up there and you loved it so much  and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that
actually i was married  for four years  but well we didn't fit together  i'm divorced now
an evil petting zoo?
i'm sorry
no it's okay  see when two people belong together the other person should be the the key that unlocks the rest of you i'm not making sense am i?
no you are  i know exactly what you mean  it's not that you're missing something  it's that the other person gives something to you that you had all the time you just didn't see it until they came along
yeah
yes  hic
nothing  
do you have the
i'm  fine  really  
eventually  we were going to be  engaged when you came back from  overseas
oh
you always do that  anyways this is really hard because you know my dad is really evil
 and it's just well deja vu
what?
we've done this before so many times  the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday
oh
it's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place delly
nine hundred
yeah and needless to say none of us has that kind of money lying around
what about a loan?  you could go to the bank?
a loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nineandahalf years of his life? not likely
well there's got to be a way
well me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and like they don't speak english right and so my buddy gets into a fight and he goes 'hey quit hassling me cause i don't speak french or whatever' and the other guy goes something in paris talk and i go 'um just back off' and he goes 'get out' and i go 'make me'
have you got a cigarette?
i don't smoke?
you tried to once  it was pretty pitiful
oh
no they're not  i'd say your investment was paying dividends
my what?
back in '37 you heard benny goodman play for the first time so you went out and got a used clarinet  you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him you tried hard but it wasn't long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder  so you gave the clarinet to spencer
huh  that was nice of me
you had a hidden agenda though see when he was five or six little spence used to follow you around like a puppy  bothered the hell out of you  but as soon as you gave him the clarinet
 he started practicing and he left me alone from then on
fascinating what are your plans for this evening?
exactly  and he got good
no kidding
nope  just filling in the blanks
oh  okay
alex and charlie?  simple  alex is the smarter one
that's pretty frightening
thanks
it never used to be  you were two left feet on the dance floor  like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step
guess i must've learned
well everything  it started coming back a couple of days ago i remember everything now
thought i'd stay in there's a good tittie movie on skinemax
i see
delly  i'm i'm not harry wasn't my father  and i'm not i'm not luke
no i can't i have to i can't
mr appleton do you know an "albert lucas trumbo?"
luke trumbo?  we never met  but i'd like to think i know him
is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson?
mr clyde you're twisting things around  i wasn't masquerading luke trumbo luke was a good man who gave his life for his country i just happen to look a little bit like him  that's all
yes i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead  i also see that you were posted stateside during the war  fort dix?
yes sir
well i'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right
and that's how you want to live your life is it?
yes sir  but i didn't go to lawson to run the bijou that was that was something that just happened you see i was involved in an accident in lawson and i spent some time recovering there
yes
and what is the state of your memory now?
i'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident"
mr clyde i remember everything
good  good  now i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "bread instead of bullets club" of the university of california los angeles dated october 11 1935  a copy of this paper is before you mr appleton do you recognize it?
referring to line thirtyseven of the document does your printed name and signature appear there?
yes it does
mr appleton please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "bread instead of bullets club?"
mr clyde do you want to know what i knew then or do you want to know what i know now?  they're two different things?
yeah what?
start with what you knew then
well i'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirtysix of the document and the name printed and signed there
we see it  for the record it reads "lucille angstrom"  what's the point of this?
well that's what i knew then  or who i knew i should say  you see i was trying to court miss angstrom  i went to the meeting to impress her
are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
well if you'd seen miss angstrom
well i know that i lost my job because of one meeting i went to when i was a kid in college  i know that i've been branded a communist which i'm not but even if i was it shouldn't matter or what do we have a bill of rights for?
mr chairman the witness is being nonresponsive
no sir
are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
why are you feeding him? why don't you just kill him?
i'm not refuting anything
yet you're contradicting yourself you earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist partyrun organization yet you just said under oath that you were not now  nor ever  a member of the communist party
that's not a contradiction at all sir  i went to the meeting but i didn't go as a member
well then as what did you go?
i do
be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record
peter kenneth appleton  hollywood california
the chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today mr appleton  we certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
i'll do my best mr chairman
now we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read is that correct?
in due time
a statement?
um no  i don't have a statement at this time
the witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee as long as it's the truth
i'm sorry sir i have no intention of making light of this committee and i have no intention of incurring your wrath mr chairman i have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath they've sent me letters from jail
i i need a drink of water
go ahead son
mr appleton you will
lord love a duck harry you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
listen to me  the young man in there
ben when's delly due back?
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell?
but what if he escapes? why don't you just shoot him? what are you waiting for?
well son you're home
don't mention it  welcome home luke
no identification at all  what're you thinkin' cecil?
what i'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here  a mystery or a damn miracle  and by god i can't tell which  boy you say you have no idea who you are?  that right?
by all means
shhhhhh
give the man a hug boy  that's your father
exactly  break it to her gently
you ever been in this town before to your knowledge?
no  but
i have a better idea i'm going to put him in an easilyescapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death
but what?
well this place sorta reminds me of something
what's that?
"it's a wonderful life"
the jimmy stewart picture?  i remember that one  saw it over at the bijou  so you remember that huh?
"it's a wonderful life?"
or the bijou  either one
i remember the picture but i don't remember where i saw it
the bijou?
i don't know what else to tell you i wasn't hiding out  i hit my head and i didn't remember anything until a few days ago
why don't you just shoot him now? here i'll get a gun we'll just shoot him bang dead done
good to meet you  again
like ernie said we're all glad to have you back
thanks
and i hear you and harry are planning on reopening the bijou
we're gonna try  place needs a lot of work
i can only imagine  you know i spoke with your dad last year about maybe taking the bijou off his hands  i don't think he gave it very much thought
well he loves the place  it's his home
luke i'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation i'll come to the point  i want to buy the property and i'm prepared to offer sixthousand dollars for it  and that's just for the property mind you  if you want i'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has and you keep those proceeds  i just want the land
that's well that's very generous but if you've already got a store?
the days of the storefront grocery are numbered  i plan on putting up a freestanding supermarket
one more peep out of you and you're grounded let's begin
a super market  huh
you think it over  no reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building
mr fitts with all due respect i think lawson needs the bijou a bit more than it needs a super market and i think lawson deserves the bijou  there's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt
harry son  harry
and what's my name again?
albert lucas trumbo  but you've been "luke" since you were a baby
ah  luke  luke  i like it
when did i leave?
you joined up one month to the day after pearl harbor  january seventh nineteen fortytwo
nine andahalf years
aren't you going to watch them? they'll get away
can't wait
ah
hmmmm after you left it was difficult and then lily  that's your mother  she took ill and died we haven't shown a picture since fortyeight
why?
well after the war with so many of the town's boys killed people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies i guess  some of 'em moved away  los angeles sacramento san francisco  wasn't much to keep 'em here i expect and now with this "television" thing  people just aren't going out as much as they used to
didn't you have any help?
oh i had irene and old tim but they really couldn't help much broke their hearts when we closed up  broke mine too  but now that you're back well things will be different around here that's for sure  c'mon i'll show you where we live
mother  she's beautiful
well yes that she was  she certainly made this place a home
who are they?
no we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and we'll just assume it all went to plan
this is the staff of the bijou
oh  what what time is it?
sixthirty  i thought we'd get an early start
you know i hate to bring this up but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money which i'm willing to bet none of us has
no your mother did then i did after she passed
well i'm the first one to admit that i don't know anything about bookkeeping but there are some very interesting things in here
gary cooper  and barbara stanwyck yowsa
"eight pm showtime ninetysix admissions receipts including concessions $8475 plus one fryer and twodozen eggs"
"one fryer and twodozen eggs?"
fortytwo was a lean year around here  the war had just started you were gone less than a month and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall  not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me  at that time it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures
i have a gun in my room give me five seconds i'll come back and blow their brains out
yeah i know but poultry?
i know it's hard to believe son but this place this little place this wasn't a theater then this was a palace  any man woman child you me it didn't matter you bought your ticket and you walked in and you
son i think you loved the bijou even more than i did  you've got to remember that  you've got to
 ernie
oh hi cue carl  sorry
you two have a lot of catching up to do i guess
you bet
goodnight son  'night delly
yes?
between a new screen paint plumbing for the concession stand and about a hundred other repairs around the theater it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the bijou into shape to open up
no scott you just don't get it do you?
they're
oh no i
yes
well son i wish i could've shown you more but this is all that's left  just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago nineteen twentyfive to be exact

you should watch what you say  you don't know who's listening
you know i'm not a communist don't you jer?
sure i suppose  that why you're on a bender?
what's the kid gonna say  sorry? meanwhile i'm not here anymore like last week  we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up  spleen here  liver there  his heart in a pan six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk  who knows?  but some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and i'm thinkin' that's me sooner or later  that's me

this is not a bender yet  this is the start of a bender  but i can see how you were confused they look a lot alike
sandra sinclair
gimmee her number i'll have her pick you up
sandra sinclair  wanna know her real name?  bella iskowitz  no one's who they really are jer everyone's someone else  even you even me  especially me  i'm peter appleton the communist who's not really a communist

i don't remember  i guess so smells like it  tastes like it
what did you say?
well you've been wet to the skin you must've fallen in
i guess i did
lucky you got out that water's got quite a pull and it empties straight into the ocean
thanks
it's possible  i just don't remember
and you don't know your name or who you are that right?
i no i i just can't
it's okay son  we just need to call you something  that's all
call me ishmael?
well at least you remember "moby dick"

she's very pretty
thanks  well sheriff's on his way over and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are
wish i could say the same thing
we live in a theater?
evening doctor lardner
uh no just seeing you standing there it reminded me there's a word for it
oh you mean the suit  harry kept all my old clothes  fits okay but it's a little big
aren't you coming?
no i'm not much of a dancer
can we get him to the hospital?
i had the group liquidated you little shit they were insolent
even if we could and the move didn't kill him there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here  i'm sorry
don't smell nothin'  he must not be dead in here
jesus
hey it's the best way to tell
wouldn't blame him if he was
well his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency  he lose his job or somethin'?
what's his rent?
thirty a month
huh?
take a hike  amscray
i hate you i hate you i wish i was never artificially created in a lab
huh?  oh sure  just pull the door shut when you leave
i i don't believe this
are you saying it's a mistake that you didn't go to any meetings? they say you did
who the hell is this "they?"
congress the fbi red channels it don't matter who the hell "they" is  "they" know who "they" are that's all that matters  now did you go to any meetings?
no  yeah i i don't know maybe i did  leo this was before pearl harbor  i was in college it was a bunch of kids and i was just one of 'em  i didn't believe in what they were saying  hell i didn't even know what they were saying
so you're saying that it's true you went to a meeting of a known communist organization
leo i was trying to impress a skirt  you know me i'm non political  republican democrat communist there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway
you should watch what you say
i don't know who fingered me but i'm not a communist
scott don't say that
kid that cuts no ice with them
what?  that i'm accused of being a communist when i don't happen to be one?
they know you were at that meeting peter  they've been told and they know
leo you're my agent  tell "them" to take a flyin' piss  i didn't do anything wrong  i fought in the war for crissakes
fought?  come on pete you ran the px at fort dix
i was decorated
i know  a purple heart
exactly
you broke your arm  you were coming out of a bar  you were drunk
at least i was on our side  look they want me to testify?  i'll testify  i'll tell 'em anything they want to hear  jesus leo this is my career
gentlemen i have a plan it's called blackmail the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorce
you can't testify
why not?
yeah well that's enough
peter i believe in you  more to the point i read your new script um
"ashes to ashes?"
that's the one "ashes to ashes" i think it's great  but it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head you can't work until you're cleared  and believe me starting right now i'm gonna do everything i can to make that happen
so it is a blacklist
don't say that  there is no such thing as a blacklist  now are you gonna play ball?
yes  leo goddammit this isn't fair
well that's a relief  i understand they usually don't let that stop them
people have to tell me these things i've been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here  ok no problem here's my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser"  using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the "ozone layer" slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom
however you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the unamerican activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles  now if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear they'll clear you
and i won't be a communist anymore
exactly
so it doesn't make any difference that i'm not one now and have never been one
that's not the country luke fought for
lest we forget peter your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than luke's
it's wrong leo
peter don't let that stop you all of a sudden
i'm not sorry for what i said
no of course not why should you be sorry?  you're the new peter appleton  you exercised your rights as a solid citizen first amendment freedom of speech all that  very noble
right  oh hell let's just do what we always do let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage  gentlemen it's come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days here's the plan we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom  for one million dollars
no thanks
luke didn't smoke
oh i see  but you're not luke you're peter appleton the picture writer
not any more
why not?
leo you were in there you saw what i did  you think they're gonna let me write pictures?  hell they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail
not at all
besides i don't even know if i want to write anymore
what you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
what do you mean?
all right then  five million dollars
kid you gave them what they wanted  this committee it feeds on names  the more names the better  but for some highprofile witnesses like yourself any name will do
leo i didn't give them the names i wouldn't do that
what all of a sudden "lucille angstrom" isn't a name?
well that's not what they think
leo she was she was a girl i knew in college
you should keep track of your old school chums  turns out she eventually joined the communist party  on top of which she's lucy angstrom hirschfeld now and she happens to be a writer for "studio one" on cbs
oh god oh god no i
so our lawyers had a talk with the committee's lawyers  that elvin clyde fella won't be too happy about it but we cut a deal they cleared you  and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself
thank me publicly?  for what?  for ruining this woman's life?
climb down off your cross  they already knew about her  she was subpoenaed six months ago who the hell do you think named you?
when?
oh really?  onehundred billion dollars  ok make it happen anything else?
when was that?
nineteenohnine
i taught you that
i can play the piano?
oh dear yes  you were an excellent student before all that clarinet nonsense  you loved chopin  you used to call it "heaven music"  "teach me some heaven music" you used to say
no i
some of it might come back to you
what?
you've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart
no
great
well then why do they call you "old tim?"
yeah  i hope you don't mind  i didn't know anyone lived here well besides harry  and me
cat
cat  that's simple  i like it  hi cat
we thought you was dead you know  it's okay that i live here?
of course
yeah me too
oh
sure  come on in  i was just packing
thanks
how's austin?
the customers?  i don't know
they will  they wwwill
oh
it's about me
oh
oh
my name isn't luke  it's peter peter appleton
i thought you
i know more than you give me cc credit that's for sure  don't you see it don't mmmatter who you are?  all that matters is what you gggave us  and you can't take that away now  you're wrong peter appleton  you do belong here
you bet honey
he's asleep
what exactly did you hear?
that you got let go
i wasn't alone  wasn't frankie ruskin directing the picture you're in?
he was but he got sick  we got a new director today  why?
well whatever frankie's got it's catching
you mean he was let go too?
they're saying i'm a communist sandy  but i'm not you know that i'm gonna fight 'em and i'm gonna win but i'll need your help
i'll have to think about this  i have to get back i should go
actually my grandpap  but "ancestors" sounds better don't it?  here
you look familiar fella  what's your name?
you didn't
'course they all know me  and i know all them  town's got my name don't it?
the war
mabel over there at the diner lost her husband max  okinawa i believe

thank you mr lawson
don't mention it  whoeveryouare
i already have
who?
my girlfriend  if she still is
oh god no i made him sleep on the couch
would that be miss sinclair?
no  no not miss sinclair  i'm talking about adele lardner
no  absolutely not
all right  all right  we'll see
yes?
i'm melanie daniels i'm sorry to bother you but
the man at the post office sent me he said you'd know the name of the little brenner girl
cathy?
the one who lives in the white house across the bay?
that's the one cathy brenner
why?
they seemed sure it was either alice or lois
which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place  did you want to see cathy about something?
no not really
it's a lovely garden
thank you it gives me something to do with my spare time  there's a lot of spare time in bodega bay  did you plan on staying long?
no just a few hours
you're leaving after you see cathy?
well something like that  i'm sorry i don't mean to sound so mysterious
actually it's none of my business
yes
because you managed to resist austin power's charms
it's a nice drive  is that where you met mitch?
yes
i guess that's where everyone meets him
lovebirds
thank you
yes i did
yes?
that sign  do you think i could have the room for a single night?
well i'd really hope to rent it for
i would appreciate it i've tried everywhere in town and they're all full
you can't judge him by modern standards he's very much a product of his times in my day he could have any woman he wanted
sure you can have it  where's your bag? in the car?
i just picked up some things for the night at the general store you see i hadn't planned on spending much time here
yes i know did something unexpected crop up?
yes
no it's not the cut that's bothering me
would you like some brandy?
if you have some i'd
i'll get it sit down miss daniels do you want a sweater or something? a quilt?
all right 
it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes especially if you're over near the bay
what about his teeth?
i think so
how do you like our little hamlet?
i despise it
well i don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside it takes a while to get used to
where are you from originally annie?
san francisco
how'd you happen to come here?
oh someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago
i suspected as much
you needn't worry it's over and done with a long time ago
tomorrow  at lunch
you have to understand in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth it didn't matter
annie  there's nothing between mitch and me
isn't there?  maybe there isn't maybe there's never anything between mitch and any girl
what do you mean?
i think i'll have some of that too  i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco you know  and then one weekend he asked me up to meet lydia
when was this?
four years ago of course that was shortly after his father died  things may be different now
different?
with lydia  did she seem a trifle distant?
a trifle
then maybe it isn't different at all you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy i simply couldn't understand it
i just don't see it
when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i'd done to displease her
and what had you done?
nothing i simply existed so what was the answer? a jealous woman right? a clinging possessive mother  wrong with all due respect to oedipus i don't think that was the case at all
then what was it?
lydia liked me you see that was the strange part of it in fact now that i'm no longer a threat we're very good friends
then why did she object to you?
because she was afraid
afraid you'd take mitch?
afraid i'd give mitch
i don't understand
just wait once austin gets you in his charms it's impossible to get out
afraid of any woman who'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him  love
annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman
no i don't think so she's not afraid of losing her son you see  she's only afraid of being abandoned
someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter
she already has a daughter
what about mitch? didn't he have anything to say about this?
i can understand his position he went through a lot with lydia after his father died he didn't want to risk going through it all over again
i see
so it ended not immediately of course i went back to san francisco and i still saw mitch every now and then but we both knew it was finished
then what are you doing here in bodega bay?
did you ever
you get straight to the point don't you?
i'm sorry forgive me
no that's all right i don't mind i came up here for two reasons to begin with i was bored with my job in san francisco i was teaching at a private school there well you know you probably went to one yourself
i did
then you know little girls in brown beanies deadly here i have a life i'll go into that classroom on monday morning and i'll look out at twenty five upturned little faces and each of them will be saying 'yes please give me what you have'  and i'll give them what i have i haven't got very much but i'll give them every ounce of it to me that's very important it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time  that's the first reason
and the second?
i wanted to be near mitch  it was over and i knew it but i wanted to be near him anyway  you see i still like him a hell of a lot that's rare i think i don't want to lose his friendship ever
i'll be going too to help out it should be fun melanie
it seems so pointless  i think i'll go to sleep this has been a busy day  my luggage
that's up to you
of course not i was married to your father
it's really up to lydia isn't it?
never mind lydia do you want to go?
yes
then go
look
ohhh oh the poor thing he probably lost his way in the dark
it's what you said mom mr brinkmeyer's feed is no good
no cathy he sold mr fawcett a different brand  you don't think they're getting sick do you mitch?
cathy
well mom he's the first to admit it  he spends half his day in the detention cells at the hall of justice
did you ever want to?
in a democracy cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial your brother's practice
mom please i know all the democracy jazz they're still hoods  he's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times six times can you imagine it?  i mean even twice would be overdoing it don't you think?
just listen to them
if your father were here
no
mom they're in a cage
they're birds
take them
yes?
well i suppose
austin is very charming very debonair he's handsome witty has a knowledge of fine wines sophisticated a worldrenowned photographer women want him men want to be him he's a lover of love every bit an international man of mystery
your brother told me
oh i suppose so
could i have a puff?
i don't think your mother would like that
just a little one
i know
are you coming to my party?
i don't think so  i have to get back to san francisco
don't you like us?
darling of course i do
i know let me just say this: austin was the most loyal and caring friend i ever had
don't you like bodega bay?
i don't know yet
mitch likes it very much he comes up every weekend you know even though he has his own apartment in the city he says san francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge
i guess it does get a little hectic at times
if you do decide to come don't say i told you about it it's supposed to be a surprise party
she said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back east
oh where d'you want the coffee?
take it into the living room would you hon?
what's the matter with them?
that road can be a bad one at night melanie 
i'm on with a friend  look i'd better go i love you
did you put the cover on that cage mom?
i don't know honey
why are they trying to kill people?
i wish i could say but if i could answer that i could also tell you why people are trying to kill people
is she all right?
shhh shhhhh
i think they'll be all right honey
the little brenner girl
lois
it's alice ain't it?
i love you vanessa
no it's lois
it's alice
morning
i wonder if you could help me
try my best
i'm looking for a man named mitchell brenner
yep
yep
where does he live?
right here bodega bay
you ready?
well it's kind of weird
yes but where?
right across the bay there
where?
yes?
see them two big trees across there?
yes?
and the white house?
that's where the brenners live
the brenners? mr and mrs brenner?
nope just lydia and the two kids
we don't judge here
the two kids?
yep mitch and the little girl
i see how do i get down there?
follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left that'll take you right around the bay to their front door
the front door  isn't there a back road i can take?
nope that's the road straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door
you see i wanted to surprise them
mmmm
i didn't want to come right down the road where they could see me
mmmm
ok well i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago he was partially frozen for thirty years i never knew him growing up he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business
it's a surprise you see
mmmmmm  'course you could get yourself a boat cut right across the bay with it the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at if that's what you wanted to do
where would i get a boat?
down at the dock by the tides restaurant ever handled an outboard boat?
of course
d'you want me to order one for you?
thank you
what name?
daniels
okay
and how do you feel about that?
yep?
the little girl's name
the little brenner girl?
yes
alice i think  harry what's the little brenner girl's name?
well i ain't positive if that's what you mean
i need her exact name you see
that case i tell you what you do you go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there not the motel that's the other end of town this is the hotel now you take a right turn there you got that?
yes?
near the top of the hill you'll see the school and right behind it the church you head for the school now just past the school you'll see a little house with a red mail box that's where annie hayworth lives she's the school teacher you ask her about the little brenner girl
i don't wanna take over the family business
thank you
yep  could save yourself a lot of trouble her name's alice for sure
can i have the boat in about twenty minutes?
it's nothing
i hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack their brain pans aren't large enough for such
impossible
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range in fact during our christmas count we recorded
because there are 8650 species of birds in the world today mr carter it's estimated that five billion seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the united states alone the five continents of the world
birds are not bad
what happened?
i don't know i was thinking maybe i'd be a vet or something cause i like animals and stuff
young woman cut herself
shall i call the doctor?
i don't think it's that serious you want to sit up here?
stop worrying deke she was in a boat
i don't think miss daniels is going to sue anybody
well you're the lawyer 
we'll make our own fog
they're back
let me have some apple pie helen  who said anything about war? all i said was that some gulls
one apple pie you want more coffee?
no he's really evil
no came down on one of my boats they could have been after the fish just as you said
no here's fine 
where are the bloody marys deke?
i had to acknowledge a delivery  mother i'd like you to meet
a what?
melanie daniels melanie my mother
a delivery mother miss daniels brought some birds from san francisco
for cathy for her birthday by the way where is she?
across at brinkmeyer's
miss daniels is staying for the weekend in fact i've already invited her to dinner tonight
scott
yes lovebirds we couldn't let you
lovebirds i see
get away without thanking you in some small way after all you haven't even met cathy and you are staying for the weekend
i'll pick you up miss daniels where are you staying?
i don't know what good that'll do  chickens won't eat
caviat emptor mother let the buyer beware
whose side are you on?
i'm simply quoting the law
never mind the law cathy you can start serving the soup
yes very
ok scott no one really wants to "kill" anyone here they say it but they don't mean it
and certainly pretty
yes
how long have you known her?
i told you we met yesterday
in a bird shop
yes
she was selling birds
no i only led her into believing i believed she was mother it's really very complicated
but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way
mother where did you go to law school?
shame i was recommended by a friend
forgive me i suppose i'm just naturally curious about a girl like that  she's very rich isn't she?
i suppose so her father owns a big newspaper in san francisco
you'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print she's always mentioned in the columns mitch
i know mother
she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer isn't she?
yes mother
perhaps i'm oldfashioned  i know it was supposed to be very warm there mitch but well actually well the newspaper said she was naked
i know mother
it's none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to
mother?
like you care
a timer
really?
yes?
i think i can handle melanie daniels by myself
well  so long as you know what you want mitch
i know exactly what i want mother
i think he got a little scratch mother
that's right we had a party here this afternoon for cathy her birthday
i got them all mother
when do you think they'll come?
i don't know
if there are larger birds mitch they'll get into the house
sir august merryweather? i was looking for something relaxing say a tuscan hillside in june?
that's a chance we have to take
maybe we ought to leave
not now  not while they're massing out there
when?
i don't know when  we'll see what
where will we go?
i don't know yet  i think we'll be safe here  let's bring that wood in
what happens when we run out of wood?
you don't know you don't know when will you know? when we're all dead? like annie?
i'm sorry mitch
normally we'd be eager to oblige 
shhh shhh
oh my god look at her
get a rope
i know you can  but i'd like to
you're doing fine
i mean i want to
but they'll be back
we won't be here
where can we go mitch? there's no place to go
i want to try for san francisco there are buildings there steel and concrete
seriously?
we'd never make it they're probably all over the road
we have to try it  we can't stay here  melanie needs help  mother the house won't take another attack
if  if when we get to san francisco  if they're already there?
they won't be
if they are?
we'll worry about that when we get there
i'm frightened terribly frightened i i don't know what's out there mitch
what do we have to know mother? we're all together we all love each other we all need each other what else is there? mother i want us to stay alive
i started to say inside
you don't have to
of course natural weather delivered to your door on demand down your phoneline for limited periods
no not exactly
yeah and the freeway's welllighted isn't it mitch?
oh thank you
al malone wanted him out at the fawcett farm
why? didn't al believe my story?
he was calling from the farm mrs brenner
then he saw
he must have he sent for the santa rosa police
what good will they do?
what?
you don't say how real does it feel?
cathy at the school
do i sound foolish to you?
no
i keep seeing dan fawcett's face  they have such big windows at the school  all the windows were broken in dan's bedroom all the windows
try not to think of that mrs brenner
i wish i were a stronger person there is a long awkward silence she sips at her tea reflectively
i lost my husband four years ago you know  it's odd how you depend on someone for strength and then suddenly all the strength is gone and you're alone  i'd love to relax some time i'd love to be able to sleep  do you think cathy's all right?
annie's there she'll be all right
i'm not this way you know not usually i don't fuss and fret over my children  when frank died  you see he knew the children he really knew them he had the knack of being able to enter into their world of becoming a part of them that's a rare talent
yes
as real as you wish hot or cold humid or dry anything you like within reason
i wish i could be that way
would you like to rest now mrs brenner
no  no don't go yet  i feel as if i i don't understand you and i want so much to understand
why mrs brenner?
because my son is  my son seems to be fond of you  and i  i'm not quite sure how i feel about it i really don't know if i like you or not
is that so important mrs brenner? you liking me?
yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses
and if you don't?
then i don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me
i think it might also matter to mitch
there are limits?
mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do  i'm not complaining that's the mark of a man  but  you see i i wouldn't want to be be left alone i don't think i could bear being left alone  i forgive me this business with the birds has me upset  i i don't know what i'd do if mitch weren't here
why don't you try to sleep now mrs brenner
i wish i were stronger  do you think she's all right? do you think she's safe at the school?
would you like me to go for her?
i couldn't ask you to
i don't mind really
would you? i'd feel so much better
i'll just clear up here and then dress
did you close the door?
and locked it
the technology is brand new soon it will be more powerful we anticipate a huge demand leave us your number we'll be in touch
shhhh shhhh
please
we know what it is al
not by the thousands
no i gotta admit this is peculiar  did you have a light burning or something
yes but the curtains were drawn
'cause sometimes birds are attracted by light you know  sure is a peculiar thing
what are we going to do about it al?
i don't think i get you mitch do about what?
well  well these birds attacked us
no need i'll call again
all right i'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room but they didn't just get in they came in right down that chimney
my wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once
didn't know how he got in there had a broken leg turned out just fluttering all around there 
these birds were
what i'm trying to say mitch is these things happen sometimes you know? ain't much we can do about it 
eleven in the middle of the party some gulls came down at the children and miss daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after
no you got quite a mess here i'll admit that  maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  seems a little pointless though freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years  you want some help cleaning up?
thanks al we'll be all right
goodnight lydia
now hold it mitch you don't know that for a fact
takin' a bath
 bottle 
we'll use smoke pots like the army uses
yes
he's not home
that's all right
monday?
yes i don't think you should leave them in the hall do you?
well i
bodega bay he goes up there every weekend
bodega bay? where's that?
up on the coast about sixty miles north of here
red 
sixty  oh
about an hour and a half on the freeway or two if you take the coast highway
oh
i'd hold the birds for him but i'm going away myself someone's got to feed them i suppose
yes yes someone's got to feed them
i'm awfully sorry
what?
i said i wonder if you could help me
lovebirds
lovebirds sir?
 head 
yes i understand there are different varieties it that true?
well yes sir there are
these are for my sister her birthday you see as she'll be eleven and well frankly i wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative
i understand completely sir
as the same time i wouldn't want birds that were aloof either
no of course not
do you have a pair that are just friendly?
i think so sir  now then let me see
aren't these lovebirds?
no sir those are redbirds
black
the sign says strawberry finches
yes we call them that too  ahhh here we are lovebirds 
those are canaries miss  doesn't this make you feel awful?
doesn't what make me?
all these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
well we can't just let them fly around the shop you know
i suppose not is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
oh certainly it's to protect the species
i imagine that's very important especially during the moulting season
yes that's a particularly dangerous time
 death 
are they moulting now?
some of them are
how can you tell?
well they get a sort of hangdog expression
are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? we have some very nice canaries this week
all right  she smiles back
i was merely drawing a parallel miss daniels
but how how do you know my name?
a little birdie told me  good day miss daniels  madam 
hey wait a minute
love
ahhh but i know you
how?
we met in court
we never met in court or anyplace else
that's true i'll rephrase it i saw you in court
when?
do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
i didn't break that window
no but your little prank did the judge should have put you behind bars
what are you? a policeman?
 death 
i simply believe in the law miss daniels and i'm not too keen on practical jokers
what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical
ahhh but i really do want those birds
you knew i didn't work here you deliberately
right i recognized you when i came in i thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag what do you think of that miss daniels?
i think you're a louse
i am  good day  madam 
and i'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds
i'll find something else  see you in court some day
what made it
 power 
it deliberately came down at you  you're bleeding
just some peroxide i want to clean out the cut
that's right what are you doing in bodega bay?
do you practice here?
no san francisco what are you?
what kind of law?
criminal
is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
not everyone miss daniels
only violators and practical jokers
 preserve
i'm sorry  what are you doing up here?
didn't you see the lovebirds?
you came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway
what for?
to see a friend of mine  will you please be careful?
i'm sorry  who's your friend?
why 
yes?
annie annie hayworth
secret 
well well small world annie hayworth
yes
how do you know annie?
we we went to school together college
did you imagine that how long will you be staying?
just a few just a day or two the weekend
i think we'll have to shave the hair deke have you got a razor?
oh no you don't
it's still bleeding a little here let me put this on
yes
any id?
 love
i don't believe you  i think you came up to see me
why would i want to see you of all people?
i don't know but it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who i was and where i lived and
it was no trouble at all i simply called my father's paper besides i was coming up here anyway i already told you
you like me huh?
i loathe you you have no manners and you're arrogant and conceited and i wrote you a letter about it in fact but i tore it up
what did it say?
none of your business  am i still bleeding?
i can't say i like your seagulls much either i come all the way up here to
but you were coming up anyway remember?
hope
i was and all i get for my pains is a a a hole in the head
right next to the one you already had
look mr brenner
i'm sorry i couldn't possibly
you are aren't you?
certainly but
then it's settled what time is dinner mother?
of course how stupid of me a quarter to seven will that be all right?
annie annie may have made other plans i'll have to see besides i can find my own way
you're sure now? you won't hire a boat or anything?
 love 
i'm sure
seven o'clock then
maybe
famished
dinner's just about ready  we were out back looking at the chickens something seems to be wrong with them
he was watching a ball game on television
what?
his wife changed the channel
oh yes
will i be seeing you again?
fear 
san francisco's a long way from here
i'm in san francisco five days a week with a lot of time on my hands i'd like to see you  maybe we could go swimming or something mother tells me you like to swim
how does mother know what i like to do?
i guess she and i read the same gossip columns
oh that rome
mmmm i like to swim we might get along very
in case you're interested i was pushed into that fountain
without any clothes on?
with all my clothes on  the newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper  anything they said
you were just a poor innocent victim of circumstance huh?
 love 
i'm neither poor nor innocent but the truth of that particular
the truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd
yes but
who didn't much care for propriety or convention or
yes
the opinions of others and you went right along with them isn't that the truth?
yes that's the truth but i was pushed into that fountain and that's the truth too
sure do you really know annie hayworth?
no  at least i didn't until i came up here
so you didn't go to school together
peter 
no
and you didn't come up here to see her
no
you were lying
yes i was lying
did you really write a letter to me? or was that a lie too?
i wrote the letter
what did it say?
it said "dear mr brenner i think you need those lovebirds after all they may help your personality" that's what it said
but you tore it up
three days
yes
why?
because it seemed stupid and foolish
like jumping into a fountain in rome
i told you what happened in rome
do you expect me to believe?
i don't give a damn what you believe
why?
i think it could be fun
it is for me
so i'm still 
but not for me
what do you want ?
i thought you knew i want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked good night
i'm trying to get you to stay for dinner we're going to have a lot of roast left over
i couldn't possibly i have to get back
cheers
cheers
why do you have to rush off? what's so important in san francisco?
well i have to get to work tomorrow morning for one thing
you have a job?
ah but you haven't see the real me watch closely 
i have several jobs
what do you do?
i do different things on different days
like what?
on mondays and wednesdays i work for the travelers' aid at the airport
helping travelers
yes
what about thursdays and fridays?
on thursdays i have my meeting and lunch  i'm chairman of a group that's sending a little korean boy through school we plan how to raise funds and things like that 
and fridays? what do you do then?
you don't get rain like you used to in england a good shower that's the ticket stiffens resolve puckers the spirit quells the nambypamby in a man
nothing  i go to bird shops on fridays
i'm glad you do
do you know what i was doing in that shop?
what?
i have an aunt you see aunt tessa she's seventy years old and veddy prim and straitlaced  she's coming back from europe at the end of the month and i'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her
what'll it say?
you'll think me very bold sir
no tell me
yes
i i am  mitch is mitch this isn't usual is it? the gull yesterday when i was in the boat and the one last night at annie's and now
still unknown but we're running prints kid over there caught the case
out in india so characterforming for the british not the heat good lord no the rain dash it a good monsoon fifteen inches overnight a whole week of lovely rain i remember one summer in jaipur 
last night? what do you mean?
a gull smashed into annie's front door  mitch what's happening?
i don't know melanie  look do you have to go back to annie's?
no i have my things in the car
then stay and have something to eat before you start back i'd feel a lot better
no thank you
i'll get it
are you staying?
i think i should don't you?
it's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday isn't it? it's so beautiful and still now  i think i've got it all figured out by the way
have we met?
really? tell me about it
it's an uprising
of birds?
certainly of birds
growing a beard
yes of course he had to have a beard 'birds of the world unite' he kept saying over and over
so they united
not at first oh yes a few sparrows out for kicks
well they'll go along with anything
sure but eventually even the more seriousminded birds began to listen "why should humans rule?" they asked themselves
you mean you don't recall??
hear
why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
hear hear
and all the while that sparrow was getting in his little messages birds of the world unite
take wing
you have nothing to lose but your feathers
mmm?
they're probably hungry that's all this was a bad summer they eat berries and and nuts you know and the hills are all burned out so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it
with my little sparrow leading team
it was like that yesterday
promised? who promised?
what do you mean?
after the gulls attacked
i hadn't thought of that  and then the swifts came
it makes you feel as if they're they're waiting or resting or
no they're having a meeting melanie your sparrow is standing on a soap box and
i'm frightened mitch
no no
i'm frightened and confused and i i think i want to go back to san francisco where there are buildings and and concrete and
melanie
everything i know
there look
yes i was just taking her in some tea
at annie's house she's all right
don't let's take any chances
we've got to get cathy
the bay doesn't
how long have they been gathering there?
the past fifteen minutes  it seems to be a pattern doesn't it? they strike and disappear and then they start massing again
it it doesn't look very different does it? a little smoke over the town but otherwise
even the birds sitting out there it does look very much the same mitch this could be last week
it may not be last week again for a long long time
sir august?  what now?
i tried a little while ago the phone's dead
have we still got power?
yes  i'm tired mitch i'm so very very tired
inland
santa rosa?
maybe
i thought they'd have stopped by now
what time is it?
almost two am
you must be exhausted
mr john steed please
how about you?
i don't want to be safe i want to be with you
mitch
wait here don't move
no wait  hold me
we'll take it slow until we get to the main road  are you ready?
i i don't think so if we get through town i think we'll be all right
hello miss daniels
what do you suppose it is?
you said three o'clock
i'm afraid that's impossible
i know oh i know  i've been calling all morning oh you have no idea miss daniels they're so difficult to get really they are we get them from india you know when they're just little chicks and then we have to
well this one won't be a chick will he?
certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown
and he'll talk?
well yes he'll talk well no no you'll have to teach him to talk
yes
yes  oh my i suppose i should call them again they said three o'clock  maybe it's the traffic i'll call would you mind waiting?
i think maybe you'd better deliver him let me give you my address 
oh oh well all right
well all right but
impossible?
oh good oh wonderful
i have no idea
what? oh yes certainly
no you'd better send him may i use your phone?
yes certainly 
do you have any lovebirds?
no not in the shop but i can order them for you
how soon?
well well how soon would you want them?
immediately  is this the daily news? melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please?
as you see
i might be able to have them by tomorrow morning would that be all right?
that would be just fine  hello charlie this is melanie i want you to do a favor for me  no this is a small one  pressure you? why charlie darling would i try to pressure you?  will you call the department of motor vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? dkq dash one seven six  yes a california plate  no i'll stop up there in a little while is daddy in his office?  oh no no i don't want to break in on a meeting just tell him i'll see him later thank you charlie 
there is very definitely a difference miss
they're different daddy  thank you  i think these were crows yes hundreds of them yes they attacked the children attacked them  daddy a little girl was sent to the hospital in santa rosa well all right but you act as if i'm all right all right  no i can't come home now i just can't daddy how is it there? i mean are there birds? in the sky? but no trouble well i hope  i don't know when i simply can't leave now tell mother not to worry all right daddy goodby
thank you  do you know dan fawcett's number?
birds are not aggressive creatures miss they bring beauty to the world it is mankind rather who
insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet if it weren't for birds
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world
these weren't a few birds
what were the crows after at the school?
it's okay
then you can't come in
what do you think they were after miss?
daniels i think they were after the children
for what purpose?
to  to kill them
i thought not birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx miss daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago
no one called it a war
i have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do ornithology happens to be my avocation miss daniels you're talking about preservation of the species a hen protecting her young there's a vast difference between
maybe they're all protecting the species maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and
are you discussing gamebirds now? all birds are not gamebirds you know
i don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town
i have an appointment
maybe is it impossible?
yes i have never known birds of different species to flock together the very concept is unimaginable  why if that happened we wouldn't have a chance how could we possible hope to fight them?
no one ever said you were mitch
i think we're in trouble i don't know how or why this started but i know it's here and i know we'd be crazy to ignore it
do you believe it's true sebastian?
no i don't mitch because i can't see any reason for it
it's happening isn't that a good enough reason?
i like bodega bay as well as any man if i thought 
then help me sebastian you're an important man in this town if you'll help the rest will
help how? what do you want to do?
no women not in boodles not since 1922
i'm not sure but
if you don't even know what you want to do
how?
mrs bundy you said something about santa cruz about seagulls getting lost in the fog and heading in for the lights
with smoke
can we go on living here otherwise?
you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much
yeah birds all they do is make a mess of everything who needs them?
we need them
not if they're starting a war
really  what happened in 1922?
they are incapable of organized warfare
that would hardly be possible
probably contain more than a hundred billion birds
they made some mess too smashing into houses and everything  they always make a mess we're better off without them
the point is that no one seemed to get upset about it they were gone the next morning just as if nothing at all had happened poor things
which gulls mr sholes? there are several varieties
the ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats
probably herring gulls they arrive in november you know and don't migrate north again until march or
of course
makes a lot more sense than well an attack
eh? in here
of course it does if we believe that birds are attacking why why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of
then let's go now
i haven't finished my drink
put on your coats do you want to get trapped here?
take it easy lady  there isn't a bird anywhere in sight
can't you please finish your drink?
all right all right  hope you figure this out folks
i'm very pleased to know you master fettes
mr gray?
that's right  gray the cabman i've had a bit of dealing with macfarlane in the past you know
if nature gives a man a collector's mind it doesn't matter what he collects butterflies old china penny farthings a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass
of course  it's the soul of the business  the pay 
but can't you give me any idea?
how could i?  i will do my best after all you see i am financially interested
good
good morning
i want you to help my little girl
i'm only a student
georgina told me how kind you were to her  it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr macfarlane
i don't know that i can do that mrs marsh
did he tell you about georgina?
we have met 
ask this one favor 
of course i will
yes
ma'am is you'll allow me i'd like to give you cause for courage  dr macfarlane is a great man  i think he's the greatest man in medicine  god would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for georgina's cure
good morning mr fettes
it's not the failure i feel that macfarlane has taught me nothing he taught me the mathematics of anatomy but he couldn't teach me the poetry of medicine
it is a pity
i can't do that  you heard macfarlane
save yourself master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned
he's a great doctor  a great man 
this isn't a game
is it a great man whom gray can order to his bidding? is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that i must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
you're overexcited mistress cameron
i'm cold as ice
but gray's only a cab driver  a resurrection man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again
if he were only that the man's evil himself some day you'll know him as macfarlane knows him  for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him that brought him close to gray he roistered with him and drank with him aye and gray even brought him to my door and my love there is all that between them and more  burke and hare and knox 
but that's long since  gray can't threaten him with that
gray has no need to threaten you remember the trial?
i heard my parents speak of it in thrums it was a famous case
and did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against burke?
aye
quite right but we still make the rules
they did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the kings counselor pressed him hard  how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence
macfarlane
i've heard of it
it's a gift to my people  and i see macfarlane and gray the pit yawns for them and the flames  and i would have you away from them and safe out of the torment
where can i find him?
you don't went to find him your news will keep until i tell him
but i must tell him  he must know of it please  tell me where he is
there's no standing between a fool and his folly if you must babble your news to him he's at the fisherman's tryst it's the inn at pennycuik you can use macfarlane's horse and gig to get there he'll welcome the ride back
at pennycuik  i know the inn  i can be there in an hour
and back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day
rules are made to be broken
come in boy  come in
come  it's a chance to try out your bedside manner fettes  take a look at the child
excuse me
you're made for a doctor young man
i'm afraid i have to sir  you see my father is vicar at thrums  it's a small parish  not much of a living 
you're too good a man fettes  i'll not let you quit  i'll make an assistant of you  that'll pay your keep and your tuition too 
i thought only the best students were made assistants
well? and are you not a good student?
but richardson?
richardson is a fine student  he's got a glib tongue but you'll be a better doctor fettes  come along now 
yeah
people too
from the municipal council  they're the bodies of paupers 
what the devil do you mean?  you have your lodgings a certain stipend  i thought i had arranged everything for you 
i saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night
not if i have to be party to things like that dr macfarlane
i'm sorry for the woman fettes but her son might be alive today had more doctors been given the opportunity to work on more human specimens  as for me fettes i let no man stop me when i know i'm right  when i know that i need those lifeless subjects for my student's enlightenment and for my own knowledge  and if you're a real man and want to be a good doctor you'll see it as i see it
i remember her
she came again today  she wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate  she feels you are her only hope
so she told me  i'm a teacher  not a practitioner
you're a man of the world fettes you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink
but i  well you see sir i met mrs marsh and told her
then who wins?
really fettes you irk me with your lack of understanding
but you did promise
look here fettes  not i nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation  i would have to study the matter  have we any "subjects"?
wilmont used up the last spinal section
you see it is completely out of the question
yes i suppose so
now you run off and see that pretty mrs marsh and explain to her
this girl was beautiful  a wild lassie from the highlands
gray killed her
we can't be sure of that
you and i together but first you must confront your greatest enemy who could that be mrs peel? the answer is obvious 
i am sure  i mean to report it it's like burke and hare all over again
grave robbing is one thing  this is murder
i can't believe that
believe it or not  it's best for you to pretend that you do  after all it was you who ordered this specimen received it here and paid for it  that makes you a party to murder
who would believe that?  and you know someone else might recognize her  she was as well known as the castle rock
wait doctor  wait  the child's fainting
pulse?
he has his own idea of a joke perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs
i've just been to see mrs marsh georgina is doing splendidly  the incision has healed  clean and fine  but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk
when she's ready you bring her to me  i'll show her how
hmmm 
dr macfarlane i wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people
that's only our duty fettes  that's the end at which we aim with all this nasty business
that's the way of it fettes  you bring the lassie to me
but she must want to stand  she must want to walk
confound me the child's a cripple of course she wants to walk  child i say to you get up out of that chair and walk
no
what do you mean fettes?
i'll have no more to do with it i'll not put my neck into the noose not even for your sake dr macfarlane
don't be a fool  one can't begin and then stop  and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand you'll do as i say as for me i'll tend to gray
the little girl  she couldn't walk far  the muscles are too weak  but she did stand and she took a step or two
looks like rain steed
i know it  i know it  the moment i was rid of him 
what?
gray  i'm rid of him 
a burial party  poor people  it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely
glencorse  that's a lonely cemetery fettes not a soul around for miles
they'll be thinking of that too
tosh  fettes  it's not their grief i'm worrying about  i'm talking of our own end 
you've no thought of going there?
did you think gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  i've had some practice in the art
you couldn't do that doctor
let me guess  'father'?
i pass up no opportunities i've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows  we'll need subjects to demonstrate come along
no
why not? i must have subjects it's the only way i can teach it's the only way you can learn the stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no  nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as gray we can do our own dirty work  and we must
no room there we'll have to set it between us
it was a woman when we put her in
hold that lamp up  i must see her face
not yet
you'll be a good doctor  i know all about doctors
why yes
well 
something strange is happening and whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out
the white horse  the horse that is going to greet me when he sees me
an old acquaintance eh?
he was a nice horse
maybe there's another reason maybe you haven't friends enough could that be it georgina?
one shouldn't get used to the wrong things georgina  you want to walk and run and play
i want it 
but you'll have to stand great pain georgina  greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness  do you want it that much?
i can't
i am not at the school anymore i left last night
i wanted to see the white horse 
ropes?
your son ma'am?  he must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so
they're uncommon bold the grave robbers  and the daft doctors who drive them on
i'm by way of being a medical myself
a doctor?
a student  i'm studying under dr macfarlane  that is i've been studying until today 
don't call me that confounded name
well then doctor macfarlane  although i've known a time toddy when you liked the name  aye and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were too  but come toddy sit down here with your young friend
medicine?  that'll keep  sit down
you will not have it?
afraid of what?
he tried to warn us 
afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be
i am the best man for the job
why don't you do it then?
i'm not concerned about the child toddy  it's you i'm thinking of i'd like to see you prove that a lot of things i know haven't hurt toddy macfarlane any
i'll not do it gray
oh yes you will  you'll do it to oblige fettes and myself
no
maybe there's some private reason between you and me which will make you  some long lost friend of ours  say that you'll do it for me and my friend mr fettes here
that's a good boy toddy
don't call me that confounded name i tell you
directed by laser bounced by satellite quite possible
hear him?  did you ever see the lads play knife?
that has nothing to do with it we've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection  it's better for the students  that's all there is to it
you know what you want and don't want  so that's an end of business between us  but we'll still be friends toddy  i'll be dropping by to see you and meg once in a while  for auld lang syne you know
i suppose we can't prevent that gray    for auld lang syne
you're uncommon friendly tonight toddy more like the old days
i've had some experience
then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together so that it works like that whip of yours you know that don't you?
i've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man
i set those blocks together patched the muscles i put the nerves where they should be  i did it and i did it right  and she won't walk 
oh it's the bit of a girl fettes was talking about
c'mere  you wanna go to homicide school?  here  make yourself useful
after the cold war 
the same look here gray 
what are you talking about? i am an anatomist i know the body i know how it works
and you're a fool toddy  and no doctor it's only the dead ones that you know
i am a doctor i teach medicine
like knox taught you? like i taught you? in cellars and graveyards? did knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
the heart pumps it
did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
the nerve centers  the brain 
but what makes a thought start?
in the brain i tell you i know
you need treatment mrs peel  you can't resign
you don't know and you'll never know or understand toddy not from me or from knox would you learn those things look 
here have another glass macfarlane i'll take you home and we'll be friends again  now that you know that you're knox's man and my friend  aye forever
i'll tell you what toddy it's because i ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood it's because you were afraid to face it  and you're still afraid
no i'm not afraid tell shout it from the housetops  and remember this  they hanged burke  they mobbed hare  but dr knox is living like a gentleman in london
there is much in what i say gray and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house my school and from me
i have no wish for a rope cravat i've never liked the smell of hemp so i'll bid you good night doctor macfarlane
would you grudge me a glass with my old crony meg?
i've ordered nothing from you
this is a gift
i take no gifts from you
watch me
this is a gift you'll not return
get out of here
wait toddy that's not hospitable i want to discuss business
you are not to set foot in here again gray for business or any other reason and you're going out now
so toddy you've made me a disease eh?
i can't understand your hurt to me  but i must cut you out
we have never been friends
i've drunk enough tonight
another little drop'll never do you any harm
i have other means of sustenance
we want to help
the resurrection business? that may end sooner than you think new laws may come
would you bribe me to leave you be?
i would make you rich
it wouldn't be half so much fun for me toddy as to have you come here and beg 
beg  beg of you you crawling graveyard rat
but then i wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again toddy
because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more toddy you're a pleasure to me
a pleasure to torment me?
no  a pride to know that i can force you to my will i'm a small man  a humble man  and being poor i've had to do much that i did not want to do but so long as the great dr macfarlane jumps at my whistle that long am i a man  and if i have not that i have nothing then i am only a cabman and a graverobber
i want to speak to you alone  i saw something  i heard
i thought i was a widow my husband  the only man i ever loved  is dead for the rest of my life i have to live with that
what did you hear?
i know 
yes
now that is very interesting   take a chair joseph
only brother
i know that you kill people to sell bodies
give me money or i'll tell the police you murder the "subjects"
no joseph i'm not angry  here  another glass of brandy i'll wager it's better than the doctor's
you mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? dig them up?
no digging joseph the churchyards are too well guarded we will "burke" them
the death of peter peel was a great loss to us all 
burke them?
you are lately come to scotland joseph?
i come from lisbon
but still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets
i never heard that song but what did they do?
eighteen persons they killed and sold the bodies to dr knox at ten pounds for a large and eight pounds for a small that's good business joseph
that was hare's end ah you should have seen him on the streets when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her
we could do that but when he had them there then what?
"nor did they handle axe or knife to take away their victim's life  no sooner done than in a chest they crammed their lately welcome guest"
i'll show you how it was done joseph  i'll show you how they "burked" them
to you  ?
no doctor  she seemed to get better then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back 
how long after that was the paralysis complete?
nearly a year
any attacks of pain since?
yes doctor
is her pain sporadic or constant?
it comes at intervals  they used to be months apart  but they've been growing more frequent   much more frequent
see here child when you have this pain in your back where is it?
a carriage overturned  my husband was killed and georgina was hurt
how long ago?
the institute  the funding 
three years
perhaps  a delicate operation  an operation which has never been performed  but it could be performed  i'm sure it could be  i could incise the columna dorsi 
but doctor surely in a case like this  a child  a little child who can never walk or run 
i regret it ma'am but i have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own
there's nothing i can say for one small child?
i'm not heartless ma'am  i have every sympathy for you and for the little girl but if i were to consent to every operation brought to me i'd have no time for teaching  and that's a great responsibility upon me ma'am  a great responsibility
but she must be able to move everything is in place
she would if she could
then all my surgery is no good there's something wrong with the child  something i don't know  something i can't define  can't diagnose  i can do nothing for her
aye  he's a good lad  that's why i ask you macfarlane
a cover  for us  i'm sorry
you think it'll spoil the boy eh? was i not assistant to knox?
aye 
did it spoil me meg my lass?
you may deny the devil toddy but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead
nonsense  you're a fey creature with mad ideas  but you have a wildness that holds me to you lass
no great lady will ever take my place?
you can get out
i'll get him
he must leave me alone
aye
quite frankly  it could have been you
where are they?
can i get you something? a glass of water? a transfusion?
where are they? last chance
or what? you'll bleed all over my carpet?
i'm looking for my friends
see i heard you were looking for some guy with a scar how's that going? you find him? yes? no?
you sent them i had no choice
bullshit you're a killer that's all you are a clown with a bird and a rising death toll you think the world did you wrong? you did the world wrong
you're wrong
yeah?  i see doubt oozing out your arm where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
stay with her
to find out who killed my husband
i'm not dying for your goddamn illusions you got that? you think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? bullshit she was already bored why do you think she was looking around? you're nothing corvis less than nothing
tell her we'll get him
we won't
someday he'll surface and i'll get him for both of you i promise i'll find the guy with the scar
dream on
"down?" wait don't tell me
the cops from my trial they killed lauren the whole thing was fixed 
i'm thinking that explains a lot
what do they do that they had to kill her?
i was hoping you'd find out
the doors and walls are monitored mrs peel this is a very secure establishment
yeah i sure will
we're getting there because in his socalled construction job tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "the hole"
the strip joint?
i believe they call it a connoisseur's club owned by delt
i think we should get some support?
what? call the police?
i guess it's true guns don't kill people
keep that thing away from me
this is not just some "thing" it's a c zero zero five
a scar on the arm of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car
so am i
there's no scar you freak the corvis kid made it up
bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg if she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened  so you're right spooky happy?
where the fuck did you come from?
big bang primordial ooze divine hand of a benevolent creator?  all possibilities although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator
i don't know you man
capital case nine nine dash c one one five alex corvis  exhibit a
you said you saw me with this i never held it until today
what's your damage man? corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker
there's no scar corvis made it up
who are you?
next assignment?
they showed me pictures what he did to her evidence said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes"
what did they give you?
a job construction twelve an hour
what scar? what fucking scar?
aaaank that's not how we play the game
good thing in a situation like this
the scar
there is no scar i'm telling you
you're the guy killed dutton
i want you to think of me as the guy who killed you
thank you steed
what happened to your leg there officer? hunting accident?
i want lauren i want my life back i want to know why
why? why's anything happen? it's all money man money the girl just got in the way
nobody

you're him corvis
i was talking about you
i know her friends
that locket you're holding you have one just like it
your father gave them to both of you
thanks valentine 
and he's right over there by the way  what did you do to your face?
someone else did it
you're a friend of the guy who killed her aren't you? you almost sound like him
he didn't kill her
how do you know?
i know everything about your sister i'll prove it to you
stay away from me dad dad
i told you i knew your sister
you killed that cop dutton
and another one there erlich took a wrong turn
darling emma  yes we:  the true genius behind the prospero project 
i'm not hiding i'm right here
you killed lauren you killed her
my dad was right he said you'd ruin her life
no listen to me lauren found out something they didn't want her to know  this
no why are you haunting me?
because you need to understand and you need to be careful
yeah i know
when lauren was missing the police came to our house they said they were looking for her right?  but i know now they had her and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you
no
 is that i sent them here i told them she came here sometimes with her dirtball boyfriend that's exactly what i said
dr darling peter  all you 
it's all my fault oh god i wish i were dead
no you don't
yes i do i really do
i don't want to see
so you're going to kill him?
have to find him first
my father
all i knew she was pulling away it made me crazy
i used to be so proud of him my big deal daddy and now he's just a crook worse even and the weird thing is
it's what lauren would do
an unholy trinity 
it's not i can't take it
erin who?
i don't know i found him lying there
no matter what happens you're innocent i promise
erin i'll always be with you
yeah we do
shut up
i know
you know
i know the guy leaves a sign
you killed my husband
some hooker phoned it in there was a riot at his apartment yesterday
guy dressed for halloween?
good for you you do know something
could say that
christ it was corvis tommy leonard was right
sign of the dead come back to life
the dead can return given sufficient motivation and corvis has that
he's looking for something won't stop until he finds it  sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want
doubt is a motherfucker
give me a hand with this sack of shit
no  i'm okay
for starters of course i had to kill the teddy bears as well 
you two are majorly demented anyone ever tell you that?
you mean alex
i mean lauren
you killed my daughter
she was eighteen years old there were four of them they stabbed her fifty three times where's the fucking accident? huh? where is it?
i do every day
erin knows doesn't she?
let's hope not license and registration please
she's sick  actually she never had mai tais before
but you you've had them
too many cooks 
not tonight honest
look i'll tell you the truth jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back she has a license but i mean look at her
i want you to bend over

what did i say?
just hold on to me
honey i just can't
stay in the car i'll only take a second
erin i know you think she's been talking to you
it's not that really it's just now that he's gone i think it's time
spoil the majority shareholders in wonderland weather i planned everything even the ministry recruiting you 
watch out
this guy said he was a friend of lauren's he had like paint all over his face
are you ok?
what's that supposed to mean? he was right here he was
the cop who found the knife in corvis's car
lauren called me that when we were little daisy no one knew but us
honey it's doesn't mean anything it's not a message
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren
it still doesn't mean
he said he'd prove it
but i found you all the clues led me here 
looks like you have them both on
it's not what you think
you killed her
no
stay away from me stay away
erin it wasn't supposed to happen
about you
about them you've got to leave it alone
don't call me that don't call me anything
i don't believe you
of course i planned that too
please come inside
i'm never going back in that house again get away
thanks  i'm enjoying it right here
the whole city has stopped people are running around like ants
what a brilliant idea i never would have thought of it
i talked to most of them this morning they were all very curious about the meeting
good did you speak to our friend mr carpenter?
he'll be there at 8:30
tell me hilda  does all this frighten you  does it make you feel insecure?
yes sir  it certainly does
but  why?
that's good hilda i'm glad
it was a clumsy way to introduce myself  but i understand you're a difficult man to see  i thought you'd have the solution by this time
not yet that's why i wanted to see you
almost negligible with variation of parameters this is the answer
how can you be so sure? have you tested this theory?
i find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another  i understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship
as though unsure of what he's heard) yes  yes i have
my name is klaatu  i spent two days at your walter reed hospital room 309 my doctor's name was major white  and i had a very attractive nurse called ruth who's getting married next wednesday  if you are not interested  or if you intend to turn me over to your army  we needn't waste any more time
it isn't faith that makes good science mr klaatu its curiosity  sit down please i have several thousand questions to ask you
i would like to explain something of my mission here
you disappoint me emma  can't you guess?  for you it was all for you 
that was my first question
it was my intention to discuss this officially  with all the nations of the earth  but i was not allowed the opportunity i have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society  we know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy we also know that you are experimenting with rockets
yes  that is true
in the hands of a mature civilization these would not be considered weapons of aggression but in the hands of your people  we've observed your aggressive tendencies and we don't trust you with such power
if you mean that you are afraid of us
we want to be sure you don't make  let us say  an unfortunate mistake we know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children you see we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years  we discarded instruments like this many centuries ago  so long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves  with your primitive tanks and planes  we were unconcerned but soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships  and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets that of course we cannot tolerate
these other planets  do they have peace and security?
we had our atomic wars  thousands of years ago  after that we fought with bows and arrows then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution  that aggression leads to chaos
we scientists understand this even we primitive scientists  what exactly is the nature of your mission mr klaatu?
i came here to warn you that by threatening danger your planet faces danger  very grave danger i am prepared however to offer a solution
'our revels now are ended'
would you care to be more specific?
what i have to say must be said to all concerned  it is too important to be entrusted to any individual
i come to you as a last resort  and i confess that my patience is wearing thin  must i take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
what  what sort of action do you mean?
violent action  since that seems to be the only thing you people understand  leveling the island of manhattan perhaps  or dropping the rock of gibraltar into the sea
that's what i came to see you about
i leave that in your hands
you'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
no  not at all
what about your personal safety in the meantime? what about the army  and the police?
oh no emma they've only just begun 
my name is carpenter and i'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house
i'm afraid i can't offer you any real protection i have no influence in cases of interplanetary conspiracy
i'm sure i'll be quite safe until the meeting
one thing mr klaatu suppose this group should reject your proposals what is the alternative?
i'm afraid you have no alternative in such a case the planet earth would have to be  eliminated
i assure you such power exists
yes
would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
yes  of course
something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation something that would affect the entire planet
i'm already married 
that can easily be arranged
i wouldn't want you to harm anybody  or destroy anything
why don't you leave it to me? i'll think of something
maybe a little demonstration
something dramatic  but not destructive  it's quite an interesting problem  would day after tomorrow be all right? say about noon?
i think we've all been hearing too much about "space men"
that's enough bobby i think it's time you went to bed
hello darling  good evening mr carpenter
boy we had a swell time didn't we mr carpenter?
mom  why does mr carpenter have to go down to the police station?
i know  relax  take it easy  don't worry we'll get those fuckers
come come you're a widow  a most attractive widow now i think of it we'll need a bridesmaid here
i  i don't know dear perhaps there's some mistake
professor barnhardt
yeah sure mom do i have to go to school tomorrow?
of course dear
aw gee mom  i had plans to play with mr carpenter
okay
gee why mom? he's my best friend and he's awful good in arithmetic he even helps professor barnhardt
did you and mr carpenter really go to see professor barnhardt?
sure we did he wasn't there but we went to see him and mr carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic
what do you mean dear?
valentine listen to me 
i mean  on account of that policeman last night  you think he's a bank robber maybe? or a gangster?
no dear of course not he's a very nice man i just think he might prefer to be left alone now you get to bed and forget about it  'night darling
i couldn't go to sleep mom i had to tell you
tell me what?
i followed mr carpenter  right after you left  and gee mom where do you think he went? right into the space ship
now bobby just a minute
honest mom i saw him it just opened up and he walked right in and that great big iron man was moving around
bobby you've been dreaming again
no i haven't mom i promise you i saw it
yes i have
right bridesmaid now what have i left out? oh yes i know: the ring
you didn't really see the space ship you just thought you did
well not exactly i gave him two dollars
come on darling  we're going up to bed
yes dear come on now  bobby your shoes are soaking
yeah  the grass was kind of wet
no  i'm afraid not
gee  i don't know the space man i guess
i was speaking of earth men i meant the greatest philosopher  the greatest thinker
he lives here in washington doesn't he?
sure right near where my mother works
ring?
where is that?
department of commerce she's a secretary  they have a man they call the secretary but he isn't at all my mother's a real secretary  mr carpenter  now can we go see the space ship?
i shouldn't be at all surprised
well  atomic power i would imagine
i thought that was only for bombs
no it's for a lot of other things too
you think it can go faster than an f 36?
yes  i think so
gee how could they make a landing?
well  there are several ways to reduce landing speed you see the velocity
you're mad
i don't know bobby i'm inclined to doubt it
mr carpenter  what does velocity mean?
velocity is the time rate of change of position
you're just kidding aren't you?
wouldn't you like to meet him?
well sure i would but   aw i'll bet you'd be scared
we can scare him more than he can scare us
it's a problem in celestial mechanics
bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer
he doesn't know the answer and he'll never get it that way
entirely on the other hand  mad people get things done let me show you 
sure didn't you ever hear of arlington cemetery?
no  i'm afraid not
mr carpenter"  you don't seem to know about anything
i'll tell you bobby  i've been away for a long time very far away
is it different where you've been?  don't they have places like this?
they have cemeteries but not like this one you see they don't have any wars
all right
no foolin'? will you?
certainly  tell me bobby  do you have to have money to go there?
no  i want to take you to the movies  do you think they'd accept these?
destruction of their local weather systems i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air
some places that's what people use for money they're easy to carry  and they don't wear out
bet they're worth about a million dollars
would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
well sure but
why not bobby?
she doesn't like me to steal from people
mr brady's a cop
we went to the movies  and we had ice cream cones  and we went to see daddy
we'll finish it tomorrow goodnight bobby
goodnight
the result would be 
thanks mr carpenter
i'll say goodnight again
yeah  sure  it's a real boy scout flashlight
why  the light in my room went out  thank you bobby goodnight
oh i'd say fortyfive
he told me this morning when i examined him he's seventyeight
i don't believe it
their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty
how does he explain that?
he says their medicine is that much more advanced  he was very nice about it but he made me feel like a thirdclass witch doctor
chaos transport paralysis crop failure  economic disaster frostbite or sunburn  on a massive scale you've seen a few samples
just klaatu
the president asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened we all feel
sit down mr harley
about five months  your months
you must have come a long way
about 250 million of your miles
from another planet let's just say that we're neighbors
i'm afraid in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way
the present situation?
i mean the reasons for my coming here
then what's stopping you?
we're very curious about that too would you care to talk about it?
i'd be glad to  not now of course  with you alone
perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the president
this is not a personal matter mr harley it concerns all the people on your planet
i  i'm not sure i understand
i want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the earth
i'm afraid that would be a little awkward it's  it's completely without precedent and there are practical considerations  the time involved  the enormous distances
i traveled 250 million miles what about your united nations?
you know about the united nations?
we've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years that's how we learned your languages lately we've been getting your television also
i do care but i'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons not someone else ' s 
police  we'd like to ask you a few questions
one very small thing a diamond 'cyclone' chip a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size if i possess that my powers would be unlimited my dear halfbrother was developing it but he suspected sabotage he gave the chip to  you 'mrs' peel i want you but also your ring
you must have a rather strange impression of us
the first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle
i am not concerned mr harley with the internal affairs of your planet i consider that to be your business  not mine
i was only hoping to make you understand
my mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles it concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on earth
perhaps if you could explain a little
i intend to explain to all the nations  simultaneously  how do we proceed mr harley?
then why not a meeting of all the chiefs of state?
believe me you don't understand they wouldn't sit down at the same table
apparently i'm not as cynical about earth's people as you are
how wagnerian  do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? that would have amused peter
i've been dealing in earth's politics a good deal longer than you have  goodnight sir
thank you have you any news?
not very good news i'm afraid  the president accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night  let me read you some of the replies  "the premier wishes to inform the government of the united states that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the president unless the meeting is held in moscow"  "the suggestion of the president regarding the possibility of a meeting in moscow would be unacceptable to her majesty's government at the present time representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in washington"  well  there you have it
it's not your government i'm thinking about it's your world
now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the president
i will not speak to any one nation or group of nations  i don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions
our problems are very complex mr klaatu you mustn't judge us too harshly
i can judge only by what i see
your impatience is quite understandable
i am impatient with stupidity my people have learned to live without it
speaking of peter there's more good news: you won't even have to change your last name you'll always be mrs peel
i'm afraid my people haven't  i'm very sorry  i wish it were otherwise
under the circumstances i'm afraid that will be impossible
there's only one thing  i haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with bobby  i don't suppose we could take him with us?
well we could
there's always somebody here but today of course they've all got plans
you still haven't answered my question
you know how i feel tom i just want to think it over
the boss is leaving for chicago tomorrow if i could tell him i was getting married  with two dependents
you're a good salesman  but i've got to think about it
a good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think
what are my choices?
you ready?
i will be in just a minute
the picture starts at eightfifty
i was talking to mr carpenter
i hope mr carpenter won't think i'm intruding
i'm sorry i guess i'm just tired of hearing about mr carpenter  i don't like the way he's attached himself to you and bobby after all what do you know about him?
is it real?
looks real to me
bobby and i have had enough excitement for tonight
you think it's all right for you to stay here?
choices?
i've got a good lock on my door  and bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight
i  i'm afraid i can't  not right now can i talk to you later? yes that'll be fine 'bye
come on in
what about him?
helen he's the man from the space ship  i had that diamond checked at three different places nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that after what bobby told us that's enough for me why is it nobody knows anything about him? why hasn't he got any money?
all right tom  it's true i know it's true
how do you know?
never mind about that  you've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody
are you crazy? after what happened today?
you don't understand you don't realize how important it is
i'll never marry you
important? of course it's important the point is we can do something about it
that's what i'm trying to tell you we mustn't do anything about it believe me tom i know what i'm talking about
he's a menace to the whole world it's our duty to turn him in
but he isn't a menace he told me what he came here for
he told you don't be silly honey  just because you like the guy  you realize what this'd mean for us? i'd be the biggest man in the country i could write my own ticket
is that what you're thinking about?
why not? somebody's got to get rid of him
i don't care about the rest of the world
i feel different right now
you wait and see you're going to marry a big hero
and you must be steed please don't get up
i'm not going to marry anybody
i enjoyed every minute of it
jittery is the word
he has his homework to keep him occupied
he's a fine boy mrs benson
naturally i think so
warm and friendly and intelligent  you know  he's the only real friend i've made since i've been here
oh  they just wanted to ask me a few questions bobby and i tried to see professor barnhardt in the afternoon but he wasn't in apparently they thought i was looking for secrets of some kind
goodnight mr carpenter
goodnight my dear
i had a spot of bother at the door
may i see you for a minute?
i  i was just going to lunch
may i walk out with you?
yes?
i want to know what he told you last night
i  i didn't really pay much attention  bobby has such an active imagination
did you believe what he told you?  i have a reason for asking this  a very important reason
before i ask you to be honest with me perhaps i should be completely honest with you
what time is it?
we'll be stuck here for a little while  about thirty minutes
i shouldn't wonder not a woman inside boodles since 
we could try pushing the other buttons  i have a flashlight in my purse
it won't work
you see  the electricity's been neutralized  all over the world
i can see no other hope for your planet if the meeting should fail then i'm afraid there is no hope
yes  just exactly
back to the boardinghouse i'll be safe there for the afternoon  and i can keep an eye on bobby he's the only other person who knows anything about
who?
tom he was there last night when bobby told me what he saw
where is the meeting going to be?
at the ship
1922 why the kippers?
i'm worried about gort i'm afraid of what he might do  if anything should happen to me
gort?  but he's a robot i mean  without you what could he do?
there's no limit to what he could do he could destroy the earth  if anything should happen to me you must go to gort you must give him this message: "klaatu barada nikto" please repeat that
"klaatu barada nikto"
remember those words
i  i thought you were
i was
you mean he has the power of life and death?
no  that is a power reserved to the almighty spirit
this technique in certain cases can restimulate life for a limited period it's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people
i have nothin' to say  if you wanna contact my attorney
red herring would have been too obvious don't you think?
but how  how long?
how long will i live?  that no one can say
he'll have you  and tom
no that's all finished
i'm sorry
i think i'm very lucky you don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it
he'll catch on to it in no time now
how did you get in here? and what do you want?
we came to see professor barnhardt
well he's not here and he won't be back till this evening  i think you'd better leave now unruffled klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad he tears off the piece of paper and hands it to hilda
so what was all this  some sort of test?
you might keep this  i think the professor will want to get in touch with me
i have never seen such a stone will you please tell me where it came from?
that's what i wanted you to tell me
there are no diamonds like this  any place in the world
would you like to sell it?
no  no thanks
i'd give you a very good price
i was only trying to be helpful he was having difficulty with a problem
that's right
i suppose you know that barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the army
congratulations you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege i guessed you weren't a stickler for tradition doctor
in this case the secret wouldn't be worth much he doesn't know the answer himself
but i suppose you know the answer
it's really quite simple the three body problem you know
no  i'm afraid not
well how do i know who you are?
you don't
they would have killed this man?
people get hysterical enough they do anything  look mr carpenter  if you can't identify yourself i got to send you over to the army
how long will that take?
they can tell right away they've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital  take him over to g2
whereas you are
get going will you brady  before i get mad
no i'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me i've been collecting comic books all my life perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
this one could save your life
it's a pretty cool place if you're a martian
this isn't a comic book store right  it's a bakery
you better get some fresh air
think of this more as a survival manual there's our number on the back and pray that you never need to call us
i'm gonna pray that i never need to call you
can't stand light?
wears sunglasses in the <u>house</u>
dyed in the wool but i can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules
yeah
he's a vampire alright
he's my brother
you better get a garlic tshirt buddy
exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
we don't ride with vampires
fine  stay here
we blew it edgar  we lost it
you gotta drive
time to activate plan b
rules are made to be broken
what's plan b?
santa carla has become a haven for the undead
as a matter of fact we're almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at city hall
zero
the prince of darkness
the nightcrawler  the bloodsucker
el vampiro
i've only got one question for you and i want an honest answer  have you taken any human victims yet?
we unraveled in the face of the enemy
they pulled a mindscramble on us man  it wasn't our fault they opened their eyes and talked
not by me play by the rules doctor or the game is nothing
they're gonna book us
that's just the way we like it
man we totally annihilated his nightstalkin' ass
two down and two to go
<u>four</u> to go
whattaya mean?
those two we brought back with us the girl and the kid  i don't trust 'em  i say we terminate 'em while we can
you know what?  you're absolutely right
maximum bodycount
we are awesome monsterbashers
and just what is the game?
the meanest
the baddest
honda 250 huh?
that's right
c'mon star  climb on

now i get it you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money you're part of a cult
homicide miss hearn  it's detective eddie flemming  open up
much better
his fingernails are longer but he always has bad breath
i can't do that
that is very probable  what's your reasoning?
well he only shows up at the store after dark  and today his dog attacked my mom  listen to this  from <u>vampires</u> <u>everywhere</u>  'vampires require a daytime protector  a <u>guardian</u>  to watch over them as they sleep for it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable since they hold sway over animals <u>fierce dogs  the hounds of hell</u> <u> are often employed for this</u> <u>purpose</u>'
how do you know they're not?
hit the lights again
to free you we must destroy the leader of the vampires
chill out edgar
vampires my friend  vampires
that's exactly what this place is one great big coffin  let's stake 'em
and now that we've settled the matter of honorifics will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?

it's <u>garlic</u>  i like garlic but
our batting average isn't very good is it?  so far we're zero for two

the most unpredictable piece on the board and always ready to protect his queen
when?
tonight  at the boardwalk
okay
yes and i'm to blame for it if you hadn't met me if i hadn't liked you i tried to warn you
that night in the cave  that wasn't wine they gave me to drink it was blood  david's blood  i'm one of them star  i'm just like them
not yet you're like laddie and me halfvampires you're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill you were supposed to be mine but i couldn't michael
why not?
because i love you
then it's not too late for us
it's not too late for you to be saved but each night it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing
that's predictable when i find a queen in need of protection i'll let you know
i know i've felt it
i'm weak soon i'll need to feed
you're not going anywhere  sam
take laddie
huh?
save laddie first
they'll be coming for <u>all</u> of us
so do i
that's okay mom  i can see it later  i'll help you unload
i'm so excited i just can't hide it  i'm about to lode control and i think i like it
as per mother's instructions
will you give mom a break?
hey sam we're flat broke
even poor people have tvs
i was here first
okay  i'll flip you for it
wanna change my hair my clothes my face
nowhere
then what's the rush?  you're chasing that girl why don't you just admit it?  i'm at the mercy of your sex glands
don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
mom just give me five more minutes just five minutes okay?
oh my gd  honey  honey's dead?
do we always follow mother's instructions?
come on sam you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean'
you're supposed to watch me and entertain me and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood
entertain yourself
i can't remember much after the chinese food that looked like maggots
what would that make mom?
you're right not even to mention you and me
no  why?
the bottoms of your feet are covered with salt
wanna go to the comic book store?
no
for a man in my position 
no  on the phone
don't bother
piss off
you have such a great personality michael   you should open your own charm school
don't turn on the light
nanook
what about nonook?  what have you done to nanook?  what have you done to my dog you asshole?
nothing  i didn't hurt him  <u>he</u> bit <u>me</u>  this is <u>my</u> blood
he was protecting <u>you</u>
look at your reflection in the mirror
just what is your position if you don't mind my asking  how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
what about mom?
no  we can't tell mom  please sam  don't tell her
i don't know michael  this is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'd'
just for a few days sam  give me a chance to work this out by myself
i don't know
don't kill anybody until we get back to you
the marines
huh?
i i don't feel any differently  do you?
and the horse you rode in on sixteen for how long?  you can't predict this time of year
they call me in when they've reached a dead end freelance like yourself
just listen
screw it i'm going up anyway
let's load 'em
dogs don't eat each other
i know
nowhere just straight to the ocean
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce whatever it ate or absorbed cell for cell
no  just that he recovered real quick that night when i found him in the rec room he had already scraped off his bandage  before i put him with the others i redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good
yeah
what was he doing in the rec room?
i have no choice why should you risk your life?
well after i worked on him  thought i'd let him rest  left the room for a bit  when i came back he was gone
well where was he?  where did he go?
don't know  looked for him for a bit couldn't find him
you're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
ah he was hurt bad  bullet nicked an artery i don't know an hour hour and a half
nothing  nothing at all
i just can't comprehend any of this it was just a dog
i've asked him to try and locate the site  okay with you?
sure  you think there's a connection?
maybe
after our fencing match i was rather hoping you would do the risking more tea?
so what's our problem?
well there's still some cell activity it's not entirely dead yet
anybody sick?
no i i don't mean infection or disease
if the weather clears enough before we reach anybody  i'm sending you and doc up to macmurdo
damn you blair  you've already got everybody halfhysterical around here
you can't let anybody leave
i've got six dead norwegians on my hands a burned up flying saucer and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century  now fuck off
finish what?
 i think the whole process would have taken an hour maybe more and then i suppose both would have changed back to dog form
no thanks
nobody's getting in here  you can tell them all that
well who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
and i don't want any more food with sedatives in it  i know what you're up to  don't think i don't  and if anyone tries to get in here  i've got rope  i'll hang myself before it gets to me
you promise?
 you think this thing wants to become an animal?  dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea  no skua gulls to imitate this time of year no penguins this far inland don't you understand?  it wanted to become us
look blair maybe you're right about this  but we've got to be rational we've got to talk this over  i'm unarmed and i'm coming in
no you're not  i don't trust any of you
i don't know who to trust

and if it got to clark clark could have gotten to anybody
a couple of hours
well get to it
a serum test possibly
when was the last time you used it?
a day or so ago i guess
let's just not get worried about anything just now
after all this mess then
i wasn't about to
after all this mess
how far's that?
'bout eighty kilos southwest
that far?
started with six  there'd be four others left
what's that?
you reach anybody yet?
we're a thousand miles from anybody else man  it's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better
well stick to it
well stick with it  i want you at it round the clock  we got to get help in here
i mean your man trubshaw  your bulletproof waistcoat  i thought you were just overdressed
no
i'll put this right through your head
what are you talking?  he's had two months training in those choppers
don't let up childs
extinguishers
i am going after them
you're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got
palmer how long would it take you to strap those big fourcylinder carburetors on?
could anyone have gotten it from you?
damn if i won't
i might say the same
thought you'd feel that way garry you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma   we'll do you last
one thousand volts  should be enough
little over two hours
what is it out there anyway? fortyfive knots?
blair  he's gone berserk
then get a move on  childs come with me
copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight
and that was enough?
move it palmer
mac where the hell is that pump
no
why should they think that?
we going to make it?
hope so  another ten fifteen minutes  what i don't get is
i ain't going with sanchez
i'm sure a lot of you already know
he's dead
norris looked pretty dead himself bullets don't kill these things
can you think of any other tests?
screw the flashlights  where the hell were you?
why?
if he's one of those things we've got to get to him before he changes nauls you and childs and i'll check the outside shacks
you told them you said i arrived on a camel shot you four times left you for dead
it'll come  it needs us  we're the only thing left to imitate  give me a hand
i'm going to blow the generator when you get back  he'll have to come for us  or freeze
just keep looking
couldn't be possible  must have weighted a ton and a half
bullshit  he's got to know damn well i cut it
what are you going to do?  drink it?
watching norris in there gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole  every piece of you is selfsufficient an animal unto itself  when a man bleeds it's just tissue  but blood from one of you things won't obey it's a newly formed individual with a builtin desire to protect its own life  when attacked your blood will try and survive  and crawl away from a hot needle say
everything that's been missing
anyplace but here
forget about childs  he's over
frankly that's how i remember it
you crazy?  he might be inside already?
chance we got to take  we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged
the generator
screw the generator
calm down and get in your position
position my ass
then we go after him
bet the last place you ever go
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
get your gear on
but that's absurd i may not be overfond of you steed but it's not my style
what for?
so what do you make of it?
you know damn well what we both make of it
no chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
who else could have used that key?
right  half of us awake at all times
macready that you?
yeah
it's the generator i think  no power
well let's get down there
perhaps your memory plays tricks mrs peel
macready?
he's one of them
when do you think it got to him?
hear what?
what?
it's in between us and them  how we going to get back?
can't hear you
the journey is part of my work
i had an accident
i figured that  what kind of accident?
that's possible sir august was convinced he'd met me before but i'd never met him another odd thing when it rained he said it was just as someone had promised
on the towers?
i'm training to be a high climber
don't tell me you're a mud carrier
'fraid so  just a regular old mud carrier
and everyone looks like us?
exactly like you  well maybe not as healthy
i'm so sorry kalen
what else can they do?
kalen do you have any idea where they take them?
we're not supposed to think about it  but i dream about it sometimes
did he say who?
where?
the hall of books
you have books?  kalen you've got to take me there  there might be history  records  something to help us find where the morlocks took 
i shouldn't have mentioned it  we can't go there
what kind of stories?
about the voice in the darkness about the ghosts
what happened?
he came back screaming he never talked about it after that  i don't think he even got this far
no
please just listen to me your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt  i'll find her
no but he must know incidentally my double left you with this
but you're only a mud carrier
i'll be all right you go back to the village and light the fire  so we can find our way home
this is it?
around here
but there's nothing here
how did you know?
i can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for    800000 years perhaps  don't keep me in suspense  what year?
1899
i must say you look remarkably good  you don't want a book then?
what are you?
did you say formal? i must dress
i'm the librarian  i've always been the librarian
i know you  you're an automaton of some sort that 
an "automaton"?  please  i'm a biomechanical organism  well what's left of one  what's left of all of them actually  i am the last   and "these fragments i have shored against my ruins"  ts eliot  you wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him he's divine if a little dour  very shy though hiding over here
i am called vox   now you are eloi
morlocks 
you know of them?
who doesn't know the morlocks?
do you know where they live?
oh yes they found our knowledge useful for a time  they used us much as your people did  then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts
but you escaped
you mean my other self 
i was lucky  the others weren't
how have you survived so long?
can you show us where they live?
why should i help you?  you primates  you great lumbering hairy animals drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception  what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed  a little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world  you're no better than the morlocks
excuse me?
you'll live like this forever alone  you were meant to help  to be with people  not like this
yes
and if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
i'm used to that
last night
did you tell him you did?
either way  may i ask: why you dress in that fashion?
send him away
what?
send him home  you don't want him to see it
kalen hold on a minute
it frightens you
yes
it was meant to
yes
aren't you a plucky little  ?
oh shut up
i should have thought that was obvious   i'm in mourning
this is the way in?
yes are you sure you want to do this?
yes  but you've done enough thank you for your help i hope someday people read your books again
yes thank you
yes
do you know which way?
this way
the air the power
why did they built it?
the morlocks didn't build this
how on earth can you tell?
what do you mean?
trust me you don't want to see any more
no
how are your dreams now?
end?
this has to end
imagine that seems that little devil got my power relays
what can i do?  tell me what to do
nothing to do i'm afraid  i'm just a librarian after all  wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling  very byronic end though  i appreciate that  do you know byron?
vox
very good steed 
i'm babbling  good to have someone to talk to for a change but you need to go  take her out of here   i don't have long
i won't leave you like this
go back to the light  you weren't made for this  i was i was made for this moment
i don't understand
i'm going to end it alexander  as we discussed
i'll never forget this
i should hope not   alexander make them read my books  tell them who they are who they could be
i will
alexander
well alexander as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions 
any ideas?
you came underground when the world was ending above  and you evolved some into the morlocks and others 
no we created the morlocks
created?
you wouldn't understand  we genetically engineered the morlock class to serve our needs
as slaves
to work the machines and build the tunnels  you can't imagine what it was like when it all started  we survived for millennia scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails  endlessly  for generations  and we became
how do you control the morlocks?
we make them see what we wish
how?
as our bodies atrophied our minds compensated
well he was a fellow of the royal zoological society 
they survived above  became what they are
no they didn't survive only to be your food  you did that
i'm afraid your indignation is lost here  i have no more "human" response to the eloi then you would have to a carrot  it's just how we live now
but this is barbaric  have you completely lost all sense of 
and who are you alexander?  who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  this is the world now  i am fact
it can't all be like this
go back to where you came from  or die here
why would you let me go back?
because the past is immutable frozen  dead and you are the past
alexander yours is a world of brocade and velvet not tooth and claw  why would you come back to this?  to save a few cattle?  no
is that written in his shoe?
i could tell them  warm them of what's to come
we have lost the capacity to reproduce  but the species must continue
so you take their best
when a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool  we're breeding them for submission  soon they will be fully domesticated
you took her because she helped me
yes  initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the eloi  but you should be happy for her  she won't remember the creature she was  she will become
a man can change his history
after all you've seen after man's entire journey you still believe that?
no
no
common knowledge mrs peel 
it's always the tiger for you alexander haven't you learned that by now?
i'm a foolish man
i know
does this prove something to you? have you made some great stand of which i'm unaware?
oh you won't be running for long
i don't think that's going to happen
and why not?
because
thanks  old nell's my girl all right  al least when she decides to move stubborn beast
i've only read about them  and the new internals
she had this in her mouth there there
now that's what i call plain crazy  internal combustion is just too dangerous all those little explosions never catch on
how do you keep the water temperature stable?
there's a cantilevered gasket on the 
i just love mechanical things
well much obliged  i'm always forgetting the confounded brake  say if you wait until i get her up and running i'll give you a perambulation  tell you all about her
ahhh i'm afraid i've got a prior commitment
next time then  we perambulate here most every night
you have my word   she's just a beauty
i  what are you?
i am the fifth avenue public library informational kiosk  vox registration ny114  may i help you?
thanks   i see what you mean about letting me do the risking  hello?
what's happening to the moon?
no  wait  the moon's falling out of orbit  that's not possible
well considering it is in fact happening i would assume it's possible  the retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies 
why is it  breaking up?
i was getting to that the moon has reached the gravitational roche limit 7300 miles above the surface of the earth  this has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances  it might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at grand central station madison square garden 
got here as soon as i could
dance with me
you know i can't
trust me
what?
what are you saying?
don't bother  here's a bus 
you promised me flowers tonight don't you even remember?
sorry i was distracted
well there's something new
i need to um talk to you
talk away professor
not here alone  may we? please?
what?  yes  orion  good fortune  sailors
all right what is it now?
emma you know i have great admiration for you
admiration?  my my
is there anything that isn't?
i mean well affection
you're getting warmer
and what do you propose professor? shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
hold on i know i have it
a moonstone
your birth stone  i thought 
got here as soon as i could
dance with me
you know i can't
trust me
the prospero project was started by my husband it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming in theory climate engineering is entirely feasible we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite a 'quick fix'
holding you again
darling
i need to talk to you
all right
not here alone  please
no let's walk through the city
all right
nothing  let's just get out of the park
shhh  let's just hurry on here we don't have to talk all right?
i want to get into the light that's all  please
filling in mother nature's blind spots  ?
alex it's just the zoo
no i'm fine  i'm   wonderful  just walking down the street with you again
we took a walk three days ago
not like this  never like this emma i swear to you  if i've learned one thing it's that moments like this are rare  and i will thank god for them every moment of every day
the sailor's omen of good fortune the hunter watching over him on his travels
so it's astronomy now is it?
i've seen it
it's only a machine
let them
i have something for you
exactly there'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea propane gas mostly in small quantities it captures chlorine protects the ozone layer but it proved impractical too bulky 
do you know you were humming?
i was not
somewhere around "d+2xy something something"
damned if i can keep her out of my equations
tonight's the night?
god and i'm running late 
you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers
where's the challenge in that?
alex this is your first year as an associate professor  you might want to play things a little more conservatively
you sound like my father
but if someone miniaturized the process
i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge
i don't  i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see
you may not like it but this is the world we live in alex  little grey men with little grey hats
but shouldn't it be better? shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
what?
nothing
how romantic
that's how i knew we were destined to be together  when i met her parents for the first time i came right from class and i was covered in chalk  they sniffed and snorted but she just smiled  at that moment  i just knew  how did you know with molly?
she made the best shepherd's pie i ever tasted
do you have a romantic bone in your body?
that's what we were working on
no i'm all bowler hat remember?
oh?
she's gotten into your equations
perseverance
i came by the house every day after the funeral  and then every week then every other month  then i stopped coming  did you even notice?
i'm sorry david
it hurt me alex  very much
then why are you here?
for god's sake david 
there are some things i need to say to you  you may not like hearing them but i don't know if i'll ever get another chance 
sounds as if someone's hijacked your research
you care for me  and you're concerned  and i have to start living my life again  i hear it from mrs watchit every day
but you won't listen  you won't see me you won't see anyone  what would you like me to tell jamie? that uncle alex is busy?  that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory 
hiding?
you know that's what it is  mrs watchit tells me you're here at all hours  day and night 
that's because i'm working  you remember that?  you used to care about your work
i care more about my life  and yours
i live with it every minute of every day
i know that 
you don't know that  you couldn't possibly  if i'd only done this or that if i'd arrived ten minutes earlier or later  if we'd taken a different path or i hadn't fought the man for the ring  you have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night  consider every action you made  and every one of them wrong
it wasn't your fault alex
 and by you mrs peel 
wasn't it? i have a dream almost every night now  the lady and the tiger you remember that story?  in the dream i'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors behind every door save one is a tiger  i have to make the decision  which door conceals emma?  and i just stand there looking at the doors
do you find her?
that's where you're wrong  i will change it
what is it?
you wouldn't believe me
i would
i'll tell you what come by for dinner in a week and i'll show you
why don't you come to our house instead?
i can't do that 
when's the last time you were outside this house    or this room?
then a mad millionaire head of a secret defense establishment a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather 
i can't leave when i'm so close
there are trains leaving grand central every then minutes  a dozen liners leaving the harbor get on one of them  go to singapore scotland manchuria anywhere just away from here 
that's absurd 
you're dying here  don't you see that?
i pray to god that in a week you're not here
in a week we will never have had this conversation
good night alex
i'm glad
his home
thank you
daphne  another guy came in asking me about her too
 and by you mrs peel everything points to you  no sisters?  no undiscovered twin?
i hope it's a happy journey for you both  and much as i hate to do this moved as i am by your protestations of love i'll be needing your money now
sir?
and your jewelry too  i guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss
i don't understand
all right all right  here  everything 
yes
well it seems like a long time  but it wasn't really  it's rather hard to explain
thank you
some  but i mean we aren't all so handsome
mm
not that i know of  explanation?
your husband is dead?
he's gone to a better place
you're not from beyond the valley
what makes you say that?
you might find the truth rather hard to understand
then you can speak slowly
i know it's hard to believe but it's true
that machine 
allowed me to travel from my time to yours
how long ago?
according to dr darling you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression leading to outbursts of antisocial and violent behavior  qed
more than 800000 years
why not?
why would you do that?
yes  or forward into the future i suppose i really should check on the machine see that it hasn't been damaged
i'll take you tomorrow you must have seen a lot on your journey
for a time it was astounding  i saw the years spinning by i was in the years spinning by  we made such advances  i don't understand half of them  there was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky we must have been incredible thinkers and artists 
just a dream  you should sleep too  you're still not well
i will
thank you
you can see so many here
oh well   just my type mrs peel
don't then have stars where you come from?
not like this they don't seem so bright with all the city lights  i never really noticed them much
good night
then you came to a desert and mountains
yes
and you saw a shape ahead of you
yes
we all have that dream
all of you?
every night
have i trespassed on a male prerogative?  we're being followed i saw him at trubshaw's 
you share dreams?  that's incredible
we share everything
thank you
and this is your "work"?
yes
i can see kalen's point
want to be a high climber now do you?
what you need is an engineer  if you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights some basic block and tackle mechanism you could to this a lot more easily
it's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be beautiful
what's it all for?
barely
i don't understand
i mean why do you do it?  what purpose does it serve?
it has no purpose  it's just beautiful does everything have a purpose where you come from?
most things  we're very high on purpose
it's always been this way here  we work on the towers all our lives when we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors
or mud carriers
and there's no shame to that  it's all the same here  everyone has an important job to do  we all work together and couldn't survive without each other
what are you?
i'm a planner  i help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like
how do you decide?
you will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection won't you?
i try to imagine how they'll look when they're done  i try to imagine how we'll fit in with them our place in the world
you liked it there
oh very much   i used to work somewhere in that direction i think  a huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature
learning was important?
oh very  learning commerce the arts  the whole place was buzzing all the time  night and day
did you have fires at night?
only to keep warm  for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night
it must have been safe
oh it was   most of the time
it sounds like a wonderful place to live
here's the one that broke the camel's back
looking back i suppose it was i didn't quite realize it at the time but
orion's belt
you know this?
over there was fifth avenue  and the plaza hotel was there this is the carriage path  we're on the carriage path
you lost someone
yes
someone you loved very much
yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better
is it?
if you only knew
someone didn't want us to get to the party
i know what it is to lose someone when my husband was taken from us i thought the pain would never end
it's undamaged?
yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape
so you can use it now?
yes i suppose so
go back to your own time?
i could
mara 
please i beg you  take him away from here 
mara?
i expect we'll have to gatecrash
no
kalen  we have to get kalen  
my laboratory was about here and the kitchen was over there where that tree is  mrs watchit wouldn't allow me in much but yes this is about the kitchen
do you have it?
hello mr philby
i have it but don't you think for one moment i'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat  now go upstairs and change  i've laid out your green coat
what's the matter with  ?   what would i do without you mrs watchit?
then if emma turns me down will you marry me?
oh i'm already swooning
ouch  all right wish me luck
i wish i had that luxury i'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and i can't go because you won ' t
describe him
mrs peel  ?
here?
yes sir he 
tell him to go away 
may i get you some 
that'll be all
i see
as i recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "applied mathematics and engineering" am i correct?
exactly correct sir
imagine that
but i know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists i'm so sorry i struck you mrs peel please forgive me i thought you were someone else 
well perhaps i have "deviated" the tiniest bit
might i ask why?
because the assigned curriculum is boring
do they?
no dr hartdegen they are not just chickens and roosters  they are science  perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you  perhaps they don't "challenge" you 
no sir 
animal husbandry is science dr hartdegen  i have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years  i have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns social behavior and breeding  empirical exacting quantifiable records
sir 
the advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation a careful evolutionary process not chalkboard parlortricks
my equations are not parlortricks
was i?
abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical "durations"  even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point?
because it's a new way of seeing the world  of seeing our place in it
very good  now if you will excuse us for a moment
i did
well we're happy you're here come inside
what are your people called?
well i guess you'd call us new yorkers
new yorkers
no
he said he traveled for two months
i expect that's for you to know and me to find out 
i took a different route
why?
to live in  there's a lot of us beyond the valley
new yorkers
yes  i hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older i could talk to?  an elder or patriarch of some kind?
no i mean someone considerably older  your father perhaps?
my father has gone to a better place
i'm sorry i didn't mean to
of course  you're just tired mara will you look after alexander tonight?
i suppose so
it was peter  i saw him 
we don't know
we have to go after them find where  
alexander i know you're trying to help  but they don't come back
what do you mean?
they've gone to a better place
you know that's not true
we choose to believe it
my god  how can you just do nothing?  they're your friends your family  you all knew mara you ate with her and worked with her your work in the valley what is that for if not to 
then it's time to change that 
we are what we are
orders
we can't change the day and the night alexander  this is the world
dean fulton
young man we have a way of doing things here  radical theorizing is not acceptable  have i made myself understood?
you supported his application dr philby  you are his senior advisor  i depend upon you to restrain his excesses  any repetition of the behavior i witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both
yes sir
now you are upsetting my fowl please go
kalen
i found you  i saved your life you were bleeding all over the place
that's quite enough kalen
what's it like where you come from?
to kill me?
i am  are you a climber?
kalen right now you need to go up to bed  you're exhausting alexander
you'll tell me more tomorrow?
they're here  they're inside the house  
no you're safe 
they're inside 
kalen look at me  there's no one here but us  you see i'm here you're here alexander's here there are no morlocks  it was just a dream
must be all the exercise i get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb
for our sake i hope not
and you've no idea where he went?
nothing personal
no sir
i'm glad he's gone  maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy
i have no doubt of that  i'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it  goodnight mrs watchit
goodnight mr philby
i'm fine
[beat] listen i hate to bother you
then don't
but what about starks?
what about starks?
should we be
no trouble
should we be what? trying to change him any way we can? [beat] yes
but the jacket? i meanshould we be leaving him in like that?
we never should have done this to him
well what are we gonna do about it now?
[beat] so they say [off becker's steady gaze] what?
i'm just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable?
depends on what you're seeing
[beat] you don't believe me do you?
it's not my job to believe you
are you kidding me? he's not psychotic
because you always obey orders 
then how would you describe him beth? merely rebellious?
in where?
[uncertainly] in that thingthe jacket
that wasn't a fucking restraint
actually that's exactly what our equipment is
don't act like i don't know what's real [beat] i'm not the one that's crazy here
[pointedly] of course you're not
don't give me that i know what's real goddamnit you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer
i had a patient a few years ago his name was ted casey
i don't give a shit about your patient
tall shorthaired scary eyes  second guy with him wasshorter with a wrestler's build  and he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me
always  except 
i wasn't pausing to see if you did [beat] but incidentally you should because you're birds of a feather
maybe not [beat] but i do think you're in a tree woofing like a dog and i'm just trying to help you the only way i can think of
sit down mr starks sit down mr starks
that's too bad
it is but when it comes down to it you just have to patient with them they'd rather have their vacation too so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the new year
they make it hard for you to get away with your business huh?
temporarily
my business?
yes
getting away with things like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison
 when i don't it comes down to one thing mrs peel trust
you killed him?
you sure you know where to find one?
i've managed to every sunday of my life [beat] some of us are god fearing men starks
and what does that mean?
means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to
you in here [beat] works like a drug
i think you know your eyes say you do
[beat] you're his son?
no i'm not his son i'm him [beat] what? you look like you've seen a ghost you can come here and touch me old man i'm the real thing
howhow are you here?
i could be convinced if  i knew who poisoned me in the maze that kiss 
i know [beat] you killed me didn't you?
no i didn't i swear i didn't i probably helped push you to kill yourself but i didn't do it
i didn't kill myself i died from a blow to the head how'd it happen? i have to know
i didn't say i remembered killing him i just repeated some words to get myself back in there
i know [beat] i knew that when you came out
how?
becausebecause you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known you came back and repeated three names
medication? what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
it was part of the treatment i intendedi didn't know what the effects would be
so what you guinea pig sick people to find out?
it wasn't me; you have my word
the three of you weren't regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove
no we were patients
you just told me the last time i was with you was when i was in the jacket i'm in it right now dr becker
i don't understand
i'm in it as we speak [beat] you're haunting yourself right now [beat] i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does you didn't make history like you wanted to huh dr becker it turned out different didn't it?
i didn't put you in alpine grove
no [beat] you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket
you may have known my father william starks
he didn't either
oh yeah sure he killed a cop right?
keeping a stiff upper lip?
oh yeah what'd he say?
that's too bad
i thought you said you never knew your father
i didn't [beat] did you have anything to do with his death?
i don't know what you're talking about man i swear this is some weird shit you're telling me and i don't know how come you're doing it
i never touched your father i swear
i wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have
maybe it's not such a waste
they don't care about all the things we do right [beat] but they might they might care about what we're doing wrong [beat] that's what they should come here to look for
they should just be looking harder
is that all?
later i'll tell you about it later we got a session to catch now
i am one of the few things i remember doing is eating so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams
sure
good
[beat] what do you need me to do?
[beat] thank you
i can't take you out of here in your condition
and i can't stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight it's already been decided
no it hasn't
yes [beat] it has everything up 'till today is done everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs
not for a moment
his body was found on january 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died?
no i don't i'm sorry i wish i knew more
what about dr thomas becker or dr loel lorenson? there was also a dr gries i think
well dr lorenson is still here at the hospital if she was here at the time your father was then i'm sure she'd be of more help to you
what about dr becker and mr gries?
unfortunately i'm not familiar with dr becker and dr gries passed away three four years ago
mom he just fixed our car
jackie get in the car now
mom this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway the guy you yelled at for no good reason
oh yeah
you're playing games
why?
just do it
you two ok?
our car won't start
yeah but i don't know what
[beat] what's your name?
jackie
hey can you reach the gas pedal?
yeah
yeah i'll hitch a ride or something [beat] let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel
aren't we all mrs peel?
dog tags [off her blank look] they've got your name and date of birth for identification
what for?
[beat] in case you get lost or can't remember who you are
william starks [beat] thanks
[beat] i know it doesn't make sense it doesn't even make sense to me
if you don't get out of my house right now i'll call the police
what? now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
no i don't have anything to show you i'm here from a mental hospital
well you belong in one
i'm sorry for upsetting you [beat] but i'm not lying to you
i thought you played by the rules
you can't be william starks he's dead
[beat] what?
william starks is dead [beat] i've been to his grave
[beat] what?
his body was found new year's day 191993 at alpine
how?
no you didn't they found william starks' body dead in the snow
how'd he die?
i don't know but he did die starks falters under the news jackie looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up
i know what this isi picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought i'm just fucked up enough to fall for this but the thing is i know what i'm doing when i drink i just usually don't care right now i do though and i want you out now
he had a videocamera?  where is she? quickly
i thought you didn't
it's december 25th 1993 today
no it's not [beat] it's december 25th 2004
i'll leave but look at me look at my face jackie i'm not lying i met you and your mother i told you then that i'd lost my memory [beat] there was no one for miles around so i know you know there's no way i could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around
please
yeah
it was banned you know and it led to an investigation of dr becker's mistreatment of some of his patients that's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients
after i
what?
i don't know how you got the cut to your head but you died bleeding from it
i don't know [beat] i thought i was crazy after you left that day i died i still think i could be crazy but then i replayed that night in my head  the parts of it i could remember  and it was likei don't care if i was or am i haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life [beat] and when you left all i wanted was
i'm playing to win
yes
then we need to figure out what happened to you it's the only thing we can do
i know
alpine grove still exists i looked it up on the net we should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you
if they don't take me out before then [as an afterthought] what's the net?
i know
how? did they figure it out after i died?
no they never figured it out i did most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road not without hurting them
me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene?
i have no idea
winning isn't everything
you think lorenson kills you?
maybe i don't know seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died
let's see if they have an address for becker i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with
why?
because that's the part i believe is true you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled
i don't know
they told me becker's in shelbourne now i looked him up and he was listed
i know it was perfect [beat] erase my sanity and you erase anything i'll ever say
you've got to get yourself out of that place they're going to kill you if you don't
i might not be able to
please don't tell me it's how you play the game
it's not a prison it's a hospital there's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it
here drink this i'll get the heat going
yeah i called the number yesterday to make sure thomas becker retired md
they're not
[beat lost] no
there're no cars on this street
i don't know but this isn't a dream i'm real and so is where we are
then why isn't there anyone around?
[beat] i don't know
it's sunday
after you  mrs peel 
william you're not making sense
[beat] they're at church and i bet that's where becker is
no he didn't
what? how can you say that? he's the one that put you in that goddamn medievaljacket he's probably the one who killed you
why are you saying that? [beat] we don't have long do we?
to the hospital
because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through
ok ssh rest
when we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother? do you remember your address?
112 orchard way [realizing in a whisper] you're not coming back are you?
you don't trust me?
then where are you going?
nowhere [beat] i just think i'm gonna be sick
good how's your mom?
ok i guess
ok
you're bleeding pretty bad there
i fell down [beat] but i'm alive
i'm doing fine
it's complicated but [looking at starks] in a way your father let me know how i'd get through to him
how?
as far as you trust me
he just saidthat i'd shock eugene and then things would change for him
i don't understand
i still don't either even after all these years
i see you've done your homework [beat] alpine grove's undergone a lot of changes since then at the time we didn't have theresources to help our patients the way we needed to [beat] now we do and things are different
i guess i'd ask you why
because i don't think i'm crazy
you're not crazy
that conviction doesn't convince me of anything until i know that i did it i'm not going to accept that i did
you may never remember at all [beat] your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged
no the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up not my mind
you lied
i could try tomake it stop
no i don't want it to
so it's helping?
believe me i know
i never knew my father did you?
yeah i did [beat] he was my most memorable patient
why?
you thought my father was crazy?
i was working with a boy named eugene
[beat] i don't know
i equivocated but you're not their big worry at present it's dr darling:  he's disappeared 
but dr morgan said you were around when my father was
i was but i saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows i'm sorry i don't know more about your father's [sincerely] i didn't know about everything that went on here
how do you know about dr becker?
my dad wrote some things down before he died
why would we do that?
[beat] yeah it is
well [beat] let me know how your search turns out
[beat] we will
i'll die either way
you have no idea what's going on
no idea who no idea why 
no i do that's what i'm saying to you
listen to me you don't the jacket is my only chance in this place
then help me understand you know you're not alone a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms what you have might well be a syndrome and if so it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously
this has nothing to do with that
come on tell me what you do know
[beat] i've seen a time that's not this time and i'm only able to see it when i'm in the jacket
well what time is it?
2004
it doesn't look all that different
the future doesn't look different?
she washes hair up at ludwig's  a salon on 63rd and madison
teddy bears cuckoo clocks toys all children's things 
no not for people like me [beat] not in the places i come from
what about the world?
i didn't see that much of it  same as now i only saw it as part of my own life
maybe
because i don't have time
why not?
i'm about to die unless i do something to stop it
and how do you know that?
because of the future i know what's going to happen
william that is just another facet of my delusions
 or grownups who still like to be children
you told me about him i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him so you told me
i don't know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions
no they're not my delusions look just leave my business with becker to me
howhow do you know?
you told me this was how it happened
i did?
yeah
you have nothing to fear william
who are you kidding doc? you or me?
what for?
quite any childhood friends? enemies?
you still don't believe me do you?
i do believe you
no listen to methe kid eugene
listen to me that's all i ask
who told you this?
you did in the future you figured it out because a part of you already knows this that's how it works [beat] i'm just telling you something you already know even if you haven't realized it
what are you talking about?
you'll figure it out and you'll do good by him
sure it's an easy address a little far out there but easy enough
good
not to speak of peter and i were both loners there was nobody
yeah guess so how'd you know?
tv helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind [sticking out a jittery hand] rudy mackenzie
don't you go to jail for that?
i tried something like 30 times there is as starks rightly figures no suitable response to that
or just plain stupid you'd think by the twentieth time i'd have found an alternative method maybe a more effective one if you know what i mean
i wasn't talking about anything
yeah you were what you said about them taking me out to the woods
[cutting in] mackenzie listen to me listen i'm going to die
mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with it means you're sane on some level
[gravely] no i mean in four days i'm supposed to die
i'm a wanted woman i know 
[beat] how do you know?
the jacket
no [beat] i mean i found out while i was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days
why?
so what am i supposed to do?
you could still always give becker an itch 'course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway [beat] just be careful not to walk yourself right into something
is it true?
[shrugging] what if we are? there're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself [beat] everyone does it don't they? even becker that roller coaster car pops more pills than all of ward 3
becker does? are you sure?
i've been here for 11 years it's my neighborhood 'course i'm sure he's as drugged up as the rest of usi guess he has to be to put up with all this
why's he called 'invisible'?
no
i doubt it [beat] i don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it
where are you going?
i'm going to canada but i can let you ride with me up to the border
sure
great get in we'll switch off in a bit
[beat] i'm not deaf
good
[beat] thanks
i'm not sure
you'll find out
let me ask you that again this time look around and consider your options
you don't have anywhere to stay?
i don't think so
i'm not sure [beat] i don't really know
of course you don't know
why "of course"?
because in my life it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to it'd be too simple i probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that
well you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either
[beat] i was dropped off
do you have a motel or something? money?
i'll catch you up don't worry; he's expecting you
well don't you somewhere? stuff? belongings?
no [beat] not around here
nothing [getting up] thanks for bringing me this far
where are you going? you'll freeze out there you don't even have a coat
i'll manage
no you won't you'll die of cold out there and then i'll have to feel guilty and i've already got more guilt than i know what to do with [beat] do you want something to drink?
no i'm ok
you know what? it's christmas eve and you look clean  i mean you're normallooking [resolutely for her own benefit] it's christmas eve and i have a couch
the best i could do with what was in your fridge
no it's fine [beat swallow] thanks
hurry?  what for?  i'm just now 
sure
thanks
yup that's me
you like it?
[beat] i do it
have you always been a waitress?
shit happens and your life changes 'bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen [beat] so how come you don't know where you're coming from?
i don't know but i think part of it's
[beat] why?
[beat] real is overrated
you didn't tell her?
maybe [beat] maybe not
you remember it?
may be easy to remember but not easy to get being warm maybe  but look you don't even have a coat and i still have to chop wood to make a fire [beat] and being happyyou tell me if that's simple
so you never knew your mother?
i guess not but as of now i never knew either
i'm sorry
yeah [beat] how about you?
never knew my father i grew up with my mother actually i grew up around my mother she was great though i mean the way she was with her friends she was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us [beat] she died young
how?
she fucked herself up day after day and then one day she fell asleep with a burning cigarette [beat] i came home from work and she was gone
no we don't mind  you mind leon?
have we been invited?
yeah me too [softly] every day for the last ten years
that when you stopped being a nurse?
i'm sorry doll i just didn't want you to be late
what
have a good day at work today
uhhuh
hon?
what?
you want anything special for dinner?
no thelma i don't give a shit what we have for dinner  i may not even make it home for dinner  you know how fridays are
it's called black leather
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night  you'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend
well then it's a good thing you're not regional manager and i am
see ya
no you won't  you'll be back today now  you get your ass back here thelma now goddamnit  thelma do you understand me?
what?
go fuck yourself
yes baby?
do you think you could ever shoot someone?
what?
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
intoxicating here have one of these
i could shoot your cousin eddie
why?
because he's an inconsiderate asshole
i'm asking you seriously sarah a stranger?
i don't know honey  i guess it would depend
on what?
well maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids  i'm sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children
yeah i could too  but i don't know why i'm even asking you this it's just we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie i don't know  i keep hearing words  impossible  inconceivable  if just one person would say
honey  nothing's impossible  you just don't shoot someone like that for no reason  maybe he was askin' for it  anyway somebody's husband probably got ol' harlan
that's what everybody says  only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night could you shoot eddie in the face?  at point blank range?
limpet bomb small very compact from trubshaw's
in the leg
i gotta go to little rock
that's thelma dickinson's husband
aw god
well son she's doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now
umm yes  she was driving
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city  he also says that at that time he met a man  he identified you through a series of mug shots  he also told us that you and mrs dickinson seemed "close" is that true?
you might say we had a meeting of the minds yes
now that you mention it they might have been a little bit jumpy
you know what?  you're starting to irritate me
when all this is over we simply must get you out of that suit
there's two girls out there that had a chance they had a chance  and you blew it for 'em  now they've gotten in some serious trouble some very serious trouble and for at least part of it i'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them  i've got no feelin' for you  but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know so there's a small chance i can actually do them some good or i'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life  your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life  that's a sincere promise
hal i've told you about twenty times yes i could identify 'em but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this
well you're not exactly an expert witness but what makes you so sure?
if waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature then nothin' will and i could've told you that harlan puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot i'm just surprised it didn't happen before now
who do you think did it?
has anybody asked his wife?  she's the one i hope did it
lena just cut the bullshit will ya?  do have any ideas or don't ya? i been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night and i still got to go file a report before i can go home in time to get back up again
well if i had to guess i'd say it was some ol' gal some ol' gal's husband  but it wasn't either one of those two  the tall one the redhead she left me a huge tip
you didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
it's a nightclub not a drivein hal  i don't follow the customers to the parking lot
you first
alright lena  go on home  we might have to call you in for some more questioning
you girls are in some hot water
yes sir  i know
good  you wanna tell me what happened?
sure  maybe over coffee sometime i'll buy
how are things goin' out there?
weird  got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'
you're still with us though  you're somewhere on the face of the earth?
well we're not in the middle of nowhere but we can see it from here
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident?
shall we?
i do believe you  that's what i want everybody to believe  trouble is it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it i need you to help me here
you want to come on in?
louise i'll do anything  i know what's makin' you run  i know what happened to you in texas
well you'd best get something even if they didn't do it it times out that they most likely witnessed it  i want somebody to at least talk to 'em  put out an apb with a description and see what we get back
alright
is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
that's certainly possible
why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this
i have no problem with that
somebody's butt is gonna barbque
snuff  i must insist you try some
tell us about him
just some young guy  around twenty years old  dark hair
i know  i'd tell you if i knew goddamn  i know something happened or she wouldn't have left  i'm trying to remember everything  find that fucking kid  he probably knows something
it's him
oh great
a 38
right  where are they?
the important thing is not to let on that you know anything  we want to try and find out where they are now i don't want to get too personal but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  are you close with her?
my lord
oh definitely
'the merry widow?' i might have known where's the reception?
he's got nothin' to gain by lyin'  nothin' at all  he already got all their money  i just don't know what we're dealin' with here anyway it went out again last night on nationwide teletype  let's just wait it out a little longer  she said she was gonna call back  let's just sit tight
we don't have a whole lotta choice do we?  i can't figure out if they're real smart or just really really lucky
it don't matter  brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out
the women are armed hal  this is standard  now you stay calm here these boys know what they're doin'
get a hold of yourself  you are way out of your jurisdiction now come on  calm down  don't make me sorry i let you come

in case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us
oh yeah sure thelma that lantern will come in real handy  maybe we could tow your car behind in case he steals the spark plugs
we'd have to  that thing barely makes it down the driveway
it's bob's the day manager's  he's gettin' a divorce so his wife's gettin' this place so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys
i've never had the chance to go out of town without darryl
still a bit chilly 
how come he let you go?
'cause i didn't ask him
aw shit thelma he's gonna kill you
well he has never let me go  he never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun  all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing god only knows what
another hour of so  we've got enough food for a month
i'll never make it can't we stop just for a few minutes
we've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is thelma

isn't this fun?
tell me somethin'  is this my vacation or isn't it?  i mean god you're as bad as darryl
english weather you know after all we've been through i should say we deserve a long holiday 
i just haven't seen you like this in a while  i'm used to seeing you more sedate
well i've had it up to my ass with sedate  you said you and me was gonna get outta town and for once just really let our hair down well darlin' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down
yeah
can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
so what if he was?  it's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded that's all
maybe
well just relax will ya  you're makin' me nervous
givin' him a taste of his own medicine  asshole
i'm sorry louise  i know you're all upset  it's just i'm so excited to be out of the house i guess  i wonder if darryl's home yet
i wonder if jimmy's gotten back
have you any place in mind?
why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
in the meantime you said we were gonna have some fun  so let's have some
ready when you are
get the car
jesus christ  louise you shot him
get the car
west  left
i don't know thelma  i don't know just shut up a minute so i can think
tell them what?  what thelma? what do you think we should tell them?
as a matter of fact i have 
i don't know  just tell 'em what happened
which part?
all of it  that he tried to rape me
only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night thelma  who's gonna believe that?  we just don't live in that kind of world  pull over
yes
it means you don't talk to anybody you don't draw attention to yourself in any way  do you understand that?
our next move?  i'll say one thing louise  this is some vacation  i sure am having a good time  this is real fun
if you weren't so concerned with having a good time we wouldn't be here right now
just what is that supposed to mean?
it means shut up thelma
it's the latest thing mrs peel
so this is all my fault is it
what?  oh i don't know  let me look
hmmm  we gotta get some money
well when you figure it out wake me up
just what the hell is wrong with you?
why are you actin' like this?
actin' like what?  how am i supposed to act?  'scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off
i suggested we go to the police but you didn't like that; so frankly louise i'm all out of ideas
well what's the big rush thelma? if we just give 'em some time they'll come to us  oh christ i'm just not ready to go to jail yet  why don't you go out to the pool or something and i'll figure it out
give me the keys
our little paradise  just made for two?
you're not touchin' that car
my stuff's in the trunk  god  you care more about that car than you do about most people
most people just cause me trouble but that car always gets me out of it
i think better when i drive
oklahoma city  jimmy's gonna wire me some money and then
you talked to him?  is he mad?  did you tell him?
no i didn't tell him  and that's something we gotta get straight darryl's been callin' mad as a hornet makin' all kinds of noise when you talk to him you cannot say anything about this  you gotta make sure everything sounds normal
i called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home  i don't know what he's got to be mad about  i'm the one who should be mad
i've been tellin' you that for the last ten years
do you think darryl's having an affair?
not quite
i don't think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair
but you think he fools around
thelma i'm going to mexico  i think i can make it in two and a half days but i'm going to have to haul ass  are you up to this?  i mean i have to know  this isn't a game  i'm in deep shit  i gotta know what you're gonna do
i i don't know  i don't know what you're askin' me
don't you fall apart on me goddamnit thelma  every time we get in trouble you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit and this time not this time everything's changed now now you can do whatever you want but i'm going to mexico  i'm going  are you coming with me?
call him  don't tell him anything tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night
will i be?
i don't know  i won't be
it's probably not a good idea
louise
pity your mother came too 
what did darryl say?
he said "okay thelma  i just wanted to know you were alright  i hope you're havin' a good time  you sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time  i love you honey"
i'm sorry  i'm just not in the mood for company right now  here  take this map  i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city  i think we should stay off the interstates  we're too conspicuous
well it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas then cut over to
i don't want to go that way  find a way that we don't have to go through texas
wait  what?  you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you don't want to go through texas?
you know how i feel about texas we're not going that way
i know louise but we're running for our lives  don't you think you could make an exception just this once?  i mean look at the map the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas
thelma  i'm not gonna talk about this  now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will  you understand?
no louise  how come you never said what happened?
must be trubshaw's busy i'll send mother 
louise and darryl don't get along
that's puttin' it mildly
she thinks he's a pig
he's a real piece o' work  i wish you could meet him
thelma kinda took to him
he's always got it bad as long as i'm running in the other direction don't be fooled he's no different than any other guy  he knows how to chase and that's it  once he's caught you he don't know what to do  so he runs away
i heard that
nothing  i'm not gonna tell him a thing  the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is
you are so sweet to that guy you really are  imagine not wanting to drag him into this  he is a lucky man
well boy he's got his work cut out for him now don't he?
watch the news?
i'm no spy  where do i fit in?
put a lid on it thelma  it's hard enough as it is  just let me get this part over with  now stay here and guard the money  if there's any problem i'm in room 115
i won't wait up
you're a vision louise a goddamn vision of loveliness you always are
have another drink thelma
nothing  it got messed up
nothing  why?  do i seem different?
yes now that you mention it  you seem crazy  like you're on drugs
well i'm not on drugs  but i might be crazy
i don't think i wanna hear what you're gonna tell me
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about   this is just a whole 'nother ball game
you're saying i have no choice
thelma please get a hold of yourself  you're making a spectacle
you know louise you're supposed to be my best friend  you could at least be a little bit happy for me you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting
i'm sorry  i am happy  i'm very happy for you  i'm glad you had a good time  it's about time  where is he now?
taking a shower
you left that guy alone in the room?
don't worry about it  you want anything?
no
what happened?
oh shit thelma  shit  shit shit
now you get a grip louise  just drive us to goddamn mexico will ya
mobile hq in a blue funk  can't take chances i'm looking after things while he's hiding out 
okay  shit thelma  what'd you do? i mean what did you say?
well i just
lemme see the map
are you sure we should be driving like this?  in broad daylight and everything?
no we shouldn't but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime
oooooweee  you shoulda seen me like i'd been doin' it all my life nobody would ever believe it
you think you've found your calling?
maybe  maybe  the call of the wild
yes  i believe i am
try to
it's mother you have to convince he's very agitated  wait here
litterbug
they think we like it  maybe they think it turns us on
yeah
i want you to call darryl
what for?
to find out if he knows anything if you think he does you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped
jeez louise tapped the phone?  you think so?
oh come on  murder one and armed robbery thelma
murder one  god louise can't we even say it was selfdefense?
but it wasn't  we got away  we were walkin' away
decontamination  ?
they don't know that  it was just you and me there  i'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him  i mean it's almost the truth
it won't work
why not?
no physical evidence  we can't prove he did it  we probably can't even prove he touched you by now
alright louise
let's get it over with
what
i i
you told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?
why not?  what's he got to lose? other than my life's savings that is  shit
and you've a new wardrobe he does want you to look attractive  he tells me you're very beautiful
you're right
just past boise city
idaho?
oklahoma thelma  we're crossing into new mexico
i always wanted to see new mexico
now what what?
whaddo we do?
oh i don't know thelma  i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays  maybe we could have children with the prison guards
i'm not suggestin' that  i'm not goin' back  no matter what happens so don't worry about me
yeah
i see
of all the things in the world that scare you what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
you mean now or before?
before
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs
what little dogs?
you know those little dogs you see people with?
like a chihuahua?
those too but you know those little hairy ones?  those flatfaced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
oh yeah  you mean peekapoos
yeah  those  that always put the fear of god in me  what about you?
or rather you don't learnt the tricks in camouflage till this accident made a prang of things how can i help you mrs peel?
well to be honest the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin' to get to me
i can see that
i mean look how different he looks just since high school  it's bad enough i have to get old but doin' it with darryl around is only gonna make it worse  i mean i don't think he's gonna be very nice about it
well now maybe you won't have to
always lookin' on the bright side aren't ya?
gosh  it sure is
i always wanted to travel  i just never got the opportunity
well you got it now
just ignore him
we should have just ignored him
peter's brother?  but 
nothing  it's not funny
what?  what's not funny thelma
harlan
what?  what about him?
just the look on his face when you   it's not funny
now thelma that is not
thelma
suck my dick boom

yeah you want it?
yeah
are you alright?
you know why  you already said
what'd i say again?
do you also know that during your final experiment your halfbrother inlaw was under surveillance?
nobody would believe us  we'd still get in trouble  we'd still have our lives ruined  and you know what else?
what?
that guy was hurtin' me  and if you hadn't come out when you did he'd a hurt me a lot worse  and probably nothin' woulda happened to him 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night  and they woulda made out like i asked for it  and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now  at least now i'm havin' fun  and i'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead i'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me  and if i haven't i wanna take this time to thank you louise  thank you for savin' my ass
i said all that?
no louise you said the first part i said all the rest
whatever
yes thelma?
you're not gonna give up on me are ya?
what do you mean?
you're not gonna make some deal with that guy are you?  i mean i just wanna know
surveillance? by whom?
no thelma  i'm not gonna make any deals
i can understand if you're thinkin' about it  i mean in a way you've got something to go back for  i mean jimmy and everything
but i don't know something's crossed over in me and i can't go back  i mean i just couldn't live
i know  i know what you mean  i don't wanna end up on the damn geraldo show
eeuww
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive
gosh didn't he say anything positive at all?
sure you know how to hotwire a car?
no
well let me know when you figure it out
father she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr darling
you could call it that  my eyes are open
me too  i feel awake
good
wide awake  i don't remember ever feelin' this awake  everything looks different  you know what i mean  i know you know what i mean everything looks new  do you feel like that?  like you've got something to look forward to?
we can change our names
we can live in a hacienda
i wanna get a job  i wanna work at club med

did you see that guy?  he was right in the middle of the road
what?

oh
why?
they'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas
i know this whole thing was my fault  i know it is
there's one thing you oughta understand by now thelma it's not your fault
are you suggesting that dr darling and valentine were somehow in this together? but that's absurd
louise no matter what happens i'm glad i came with you
you're crazy
you too sweetie the best
i guess i went a little crazy huh?
no you've always been crazy this is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty
unbearable i'd imagine
i guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway
how do you stay so positive?
what?
getting to what?
what in the hell is that up there?
where?
way up ahead
it's the goddamn grand canyon

s'matter with you? you look like you're fading
the thing's kind of heavy
well just so you know  i gave you guys the credit
well i can't possibly go like this
heavy? heavy? what i wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like you insensitive prick
no i just meant
yeah yeah i'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee
so you admit it?
guilty as charged i'm not gonna play games with you i could give you a song and dance but what's the point? i did it and we all know it  the hitcher himself told me it's illegal the irony
jeez i didn't catch it
hitchhikers? i don't know  fifty a hundred maybe  who keeps track?
i guess
you sent that?
uhhuh i was worried about you
 and now?
well thank you but you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me
that's what i want to tell ya i've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? you were right  i needed help
that's great woogie i'm happy you're better  you seem good but you put me through quite an ordeal you know
woogie i caught you redhanded
all right i did but i was in a weird place then
oh mary honey you're taking this all wrong  i'm not leaving
not until i get a little something to remember you by
stop that no somebody help me
just one pair you owe me that much you heartless bitch
he implied it
let me guess:  wonderland weather
well you're a writer and a lot of writers are gay look at truman capote
yeah but he was successful
let me ask you this: when you smoke a cigar do you ever pretend it has balls?
i'm going to fix you up with my new assistant
what's he like?
goodlooking?
i just told you she's half asian half american they're all good looking you could mate don rickles and yoko ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid it's a foolproof combo
loser? you?
oh so i'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
i never said that i'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys  besides your brother jimmy never gave a shit about you
very good mrs peel 
each day is better than the next  have you ever been you know in love with someone?
nah
never?
well once mary
look i admit it was brief but it was definitely love crushes don't last twelve years
whatever happened to mary?
i told you her family moved to miami
i mean since then
i don't know
well why don't you look her up?
i shall need a small plane
yeah right
why not?
because i guarantee she's married and has a couple kids girls like mary don't stay single
what if you're wrong? you just said she's the only girl you ever loved what have you got to lose by calling her?
i did try calling her  a few years ago she wasn't listed
so that was it? one bump in the road and you gave up?
i also called unsolved mysteries
you're kidding? what did they say?
they told me they don't help out stalkers  look maybe they're right it's been a long time
i got it  you hire a private eye fly him out there he follows her around a couple days she'll never know a thing
you're not venturing alone surely
relax this guy owes me a big one a couple years ago he got in a jam up in the boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume  like we haven't all done that anyway they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tearjerker letter that ended up on my desk
his mother?
yeah i guess he still lives with her seemed like a sweet lady  got diabetes or something  so i went out on a limb and got him transferred down to providence
and you think he could find out her number for me?
he'll do better than that i'll send him down to miami on business you throw him a couple bucks on the side and he'll track her down
hey look on the bright side 
what's that dom? what's the bright side?
well at least now you know
i think it was better when i didn't it was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world
i'm sorry it's just that you're taking this all wrong pal don't you see? you're liberated i feel liberated i mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you
i'm going to find out who killed my husband will you take these documents to steed?
christ ted i was only four towns away
what? on your day off? do you even know the guy?

the most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load that's a medical fact and it's because you're no longer trying to get laid you're actually thinking like a girl they love that

a girl after your own heart ted
brenda and i thought we'd drop in

you own a home there?
well it's just a condo really right outside katmandu
wow that's a place i've always wanted to go is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit that's been my experience anyway
thanks
same here again
you didn't come to talk about the weather surely
by the way what's your name?
pat healy
i already know it mary
how'd you know that?
it's right there on your golf bag
some buildings i'm working on
are you an architect?
well just until i get my pga tour card
what's that?
i work with retards
oh yes i did i want you to meet somebody  i expect you'll like her
i beg your pardon?
you know  the guys who ride the short bus
isn't that a little politically incorrect?
the hell with that no one's gonna tell me who i can and can't work with
no i mean
 there's this one kid we call him mongo on account of he's a mongoloid he got out of his cage once and 
 he's in a cage?
well it's more of an enclosure really
they keep him confined? that's bullshit
that's what i said so i went out and got him a leash you know one of those clothesline runners for the backyard he's got plenty of room out there to dig the kid's really blossomed now i can take him to ball games movies  you know happy stuff
perhaps i'd better start calling you doctor again mrs peel 
that sounds like fun
yeah it's fun for them but it's heaven for me  those goofy bastards are just about the best thing i have in this crazy old world  ooh hey i gotta run
look uh i was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime

we will but first i have a surprise
a surprise?
the architecture exhibit my friend tucker is going to be here he's an architect too you guys will have tons to talk about
what say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
nah why should you?
she may not know theory goes she may be very ill
we just got here thirty seconds ago isn't this stuff great?
deco
would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
that? vestibule
how about  ?
when you look at architecture try not to concern yourself with the pieces  look at the building in its totalitarianism
magda? she's not my grandmother  actually she rents the apartment right next to mine her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone
and it doesn't cramp your style?
sadly no well except for the lint
lint?
amnesia?
yeah i think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day  just makes for a lot of lint look at this
why bounce when you have your own condo in nepal to go to?
you're a movie buff?
try to be it's tough going with the crap they make today if dumb and dumber's the best they've got to offer i say thanks but no thanks
have you seen it?
no but the boston globe critic jay carr hated it
a fucking moron
huh i guess i just wish they made them like they used to you know something like the heartbreak kid or harold and maude
ouch come on don't bust my chops i know it's corny but i do love it
pat i'm not kidding i really think it's the greatest 
possibly split personality 
 love story of our time
wow i thought i was the only one
yeah i guess this is it huh?
i guess
well i'll see ya
what?
no forget it it was stupid
come on what were you going to say?
nah really it was moronic

any idea where i might start looking?
she moved to miami beach twelve years ago i checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed she might've moved ten times since then
all you want is a phone number?
well i know you're busy
don't play games with me ted
i don't know maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a labrador
i don't buy it
you don't buy what?
no
why?
she's blackmailing you right?
no
you want her dead don't you?
you can't be serious
do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
i'm not a stalker she's a friend of mine
sure she is that's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years oh you're good ted you're a real piece of work
look let's forget it let's forget the whole thing
i get one hundred a day plus expenses
you get fifty a day period it's a business trip they'll pay for your expenses
she may try to kill you
really?  very very?
so you found mary?
right there in liberty city and you were right she's really something
so she hasn't changed?
that i couldn't say let me ask you something: was she a little bigboned in high school?
no not at all
well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years
i'd say about a deuce deuce and a half not bad
so she's married?
nope never been
how come you took so much interest in her dr darling?
huh?
four kids three different guys
three different guys?
well i'm guessing there's a black kid two whites and a midget
oh my
hyperactive little fuckers too tough to keep up with in a wheelchair i bet
she's in a wheelchair?
it's just that mary i wouldn't have thought
anyway the good news is i have all the information you need got it from her bookie  nice guy you should definitely call her ted i mean she's a real sparkplug that one she seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help i'll bet she does it
ted? don't you want the name of the housing project?
anyone particular in mind?
uh that's okay
you sure big guy? i'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy
oh uh i resigned
yeah this insurance business is too slow for me i'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai
jai alai?
yeah i don't know why but i always felt at home in the fronton
good good
well i think you're right i should look her up
rollerpig? are you nuts?
but you said she was a sparkplug?
you
i said buttplug she's heinous
it's a goddamn bunion it'll heal
oh i thought  that's not it anyway i know this doesn't make any sense to you but i just can't turn it off that fast i still feel something for her
japan? what's she doing in japan?
you've heard of mailorder brides? well they go that way too
fetched a pretty penny too don't forget it's the sumo culture they pay by the pound there sort of like tuna
surprised?
what do you mean 'why'?
answer the question shitball
do what?
i don't even watch tv
too late anyway today's escapade was only for starters this is no ordinary weather it's manmade a kind of weather bomb
turn her over to a stalker
what? you're calling me a stalker?
that's right  if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself
you're a sick man you know that?
yeah well fuck you you just can't stand the fact that it was my turn
your turn?
that's right hot shot my turn what's the matter with me huh? why can't i ever get the great girl? give the big pig with the bo to healy right? well i was sick of it man no more  it was my turn it was time for me time for me to be happy
i don't know what you're talking about

same here
boston huh? did you get your degree up there?
yes yes i did get my degree up there
harvard?
you bet

among others
kim and i are close friends
well i'll tell her i ran into you

nice smokescreen isn't it?
absolutely i was there twice last year which building is yours?
do you know the soccer stadium?
did you build the estadio olympico?
no just down the street the amigo tower
i'm sorry i'm not familiar with it what style?
uh sort of nouveau deco with a big vestibule check it out next time you're up there
oh look it's doob will you excuse me a minute tucker?
who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation on the day he died he was setting a test to prove to himself  to us that his wife was beyond suspicion he had to be certain he said he was going to give mrs peel something 
maybe this'll jog your memory
who?
you heard me goddamnit i i love her
what do you mean?
i mean i'm a fucking fraud i'm no architect don't be a putz  who's been to santiago twice in a year?  estadio olimpico  please
but but you knew people at harvard
i knew shit the only thing i knew was that you were a fake and i made up everything else  my real name's norm i deliver pizzas
bullshit
and you met mary how?
just dumb luck i delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown  that was it for me i went home that night shaved my beard and a week later i was laid out in her office with a broken back
guilty until proven innocent?
how'd you manage that one?
friend baseball bat
nice
oh yeah the plan was going along just fine until you showed up
hey hey hey i'm not the one who started telling baldfaced lies about the competition  that's crossing the line
what line? the day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war
future wife? get real man  you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes
why you son of a 
fucking sickening
four
mother and father know best
that seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch  you sure it won't kill him?
i never said that
hey this is a pretty nice place
sully what the fuck happened here?
what?
you fucking prick we had a deal  you said you wouldn't fuck me and i wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture  you crossed the line man
oh that makes a lot of sense why would i rat myself out?
like i'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
you were following us?
don't flatter yourself  i was following her i always do how the hell you think i got rid of mary's boyfriend steve?
you're getting yourself into terrible trouble my son weather's turning very nasty  and so am i
look if it wasn't you who sent the letter and it wasn't me who sent it?
no prob i could use the company i've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight
i know how you feel  i been standing in the same spot for the last five hours you know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state
that must make it tough
sucks so what's up? you some kind of salesman or something?
nah i'm i'm nothing
oh well i am
hm?
a salesman  that's what i am i mean i'm gonna be anyway i'm starting my own company  video sales  just as soon as i get enough seed money
'that right? good for you
i'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own if i'm right mrs peel is innocent and you have a mole
yeah you wouldn't believe my idea  it's a home run you ever hear of eightminute abs?
the exercise tape? sure i've seen it on tv
two million copies it sold last year two million man but not next year  my idea's gonna blow them outta the water get this:  sevenminute abs
think about it you walk into a video store and you see eightminute abs and right next to it you see seven minute abs  which one you gonna spring for?
i'd go with the seven
bingo especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work out
how do you guarantee that?
well it's the company motto: 'if you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute'
huh that sounds great  unless someone else comes out with sixminute abs
ugh not pecs sounds like one of those guys with a fishnet shirt and a banana hammock
where?
i'm sick of these caloriecountin' pansies give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty six holes and still has enough energy to take me and warren out to a ballgame
jeez i don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that
but here's the rub the guy i'm talking about has got to be self employed
what's that supposed to mean?
it means you're too hard on guys
no i'm not
oh come off it mare what about what'shisname steverino? you could've at least passed the baton on that one
all right for awhile? the guy's good looking rich witty he was a god
is that old crab still with you? mary you said you were putting her up for a month  it's been a year and a half
ah she's okay
in your operation
i don't want someone who'll put up with him i want someone who will enjoy him the way i do do you know what he told my friend tucker? he said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if warren wasn't in my life  well he is in my life and i'm goddamn lucky to have him the hell with steve
bet your ass i have it's an important job neighborhood watch is
neighborhood watch? is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
these ain't strangers they're neighbors this only picks up signals in a halfmile radius
meaning?
meaning these are the people you live amongst you got a right to know if they're creeps for instance did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
you picked that up on the scanner we gotta move
i confirmed it on the scanner i knew something was up because puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know puffy only barks at bad people
that's because there's a lot of bad people out there hey puffy tried to warn you about that steve guy you was seeing  he was a fucking asswipe  but you had to find out for yourself didn't you?
okay you win now try to get some sleep huh
good  good  commendable
i'm warning you for the last time steed: whoever's behind all this looks like mrs peel walks like mrs peel and kills like mrs peel
no time magda my show's starting
name's patrick i met him at the driving range
good lookin'?
he's no steve young
i don't know he's kind of a mook
what's a mook?
you know a mookalone a schlep
then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
come on magda  it's like that movie harold and maude
i don't watch the new ones
i think so thank you so much 
this one's almost thirty years old it's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love
that's exactly why i don't watch 'em anymore  it's bullshit why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
fuck kindred spirits my little puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat if he starts yapping he's a loser; if puffy's relaxed well you got yourself a keeper
oh yeah of course dear
must have a sweet tooth see if you can find some cookies
healy
why?
back when i was your age i always used to make myself a big banana split after sex i think you're gonna need one tonight
don't get ahead of yourself you'll probably need it before i will
so maybe i could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies
i feel sure of it
knock it off pollyanna just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be
love? come on i wouldn't call it love
oh no? i ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the blue monster
kind of ted peloquin  one of the sweetest guys in the world
i can't do it  i just found out it's his birthday  i guess i've gotta cancel on ted
puffy get over here
the little shit lied to me about that guy
where's puffy?
ah he was being a pest so i put him in the bathroom
hey no kidding? where are your offices?
i'm alice mother said you'd be on your way mrs peel with you?
where would i have seen your work?
tucker you look different some how did you do something with your hair?
no no the bigger the better  but i must say they could be a little brighter nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites
well that's what i'm trying to figure out how long have you known him?
that's what you've been looking for  a farter?
i've been looking for a guy  not one of these south beach pussies
look it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night he gave me this funny vibe anyway i called some friends back east they don't know of any architect named patrick healy and he's not listed as a harvard alumnus
no no no tucker thank you
i mean let's face it mary you're beautiful you've got money you trust people  i'm just saying there's a lot of psychos out there
i appreciate you looking out for me
she was 
thanks but i've got to be going unfortunately doc this isn't a social visit
well i've got a little more news about your friend healy
tucker i appreciate you doing all this but i'm really strapped for time here and 
mary the man's a killer
i've got a friend in the boston police department he faxed me this this morning i'll just give you the highlights  after a short stint as a petty thief patrick r healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen at sixteen he committed his first murder  a pretty teacher's aid named molly pettygrove he was incarcerated until age twentytwo when despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him in his mid twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington unfortunately the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him and on and on and so forth and so on
okay just calm down it's going to be okay
don't get all gooey on me now you'll give me a big head  the important thing doctor is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off
yeah yeah okay i think i know what to do i'll call him right now
you mean he's not a criminal?
oh jesus
both actually
thanks a lot ted
no it's an old football injury
oh are you on the team?
no a couple of the players and me were joking around and uh i fell off the school
a real clydesdale huh warren?
huh?
the prom  you going?
oh i don't know i think proms are pretty dumb
'cause i thought maybe you and i could go if you weren't already taking someone
i mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year
good glad to see they're together at last they don't get along promotion top job most unfair quite a fuss at the ministry

what about you mare? how the hell'd you manage to stay single?
i don't know my friends think i'm too picky i think i'm just a weirdo magnet i did come close once  just last year in fact there was this guy he lived in san francisco

walk over to the window 
yeah almost  you want to come up and watch sportscenter?
uh no i think i'm gonna get out while i'm ahead
look mary the truth is i'll be in town for a while now but i don't think we should see each other for a few weeks
why not?
well to be honest i'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when i get nervous i'm not myself and i'm afraid i'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so i think i should just lay back until i regain my composure
all right let's go

toy poodle
wait hold on mary  it's not as bad as it sounds i certainly didn't know 
that you put a murderer on my trail?
let it be rain please let it be 
well yeah i didn't know much about him i just thought 
what did you think ted? that you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone i could really go for?
then what the fuck did you do it for?
i did it because because i'd never stopped thinking about you and if i didn't find you i knew my life would never be good again
mary come on
go

you forgot your keys
i i just want you to be happy mary

see the thing is i heard a rumor that this guy i like was gonna ask me
uhhuh
yeah so i'm gonna wait and see what happens there but that sounds great yeah
i think i was very clear ted if everything else falls apart maybe
i don't mind if you think he can hold me
i was at harrow 
giddyup
jesus i think her brother spotted me
good ted piggy back ride?
i'm gonna take a rain check
huh?
bye ted
we're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier if it turns ugly the russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine
what are you doing?
carrying out our mission mr secretary if you don't mind we're very busy right now we need to be able to do our jobs
admiral i asked you a question
but did they teach you this?
what 
get out of our way mr secretary the navy has been running blockades since the days of john paul jones
with all due respect mr secretary we were not firing on the ship firing on a ship means attacking the ship we were not attacking the ship we were firing over it
this was not the president's intention when he gave that order what if the soviets don't see the distention? what if they make the same mistake i just did?  there will be no firing anything near any soviet ships without my express permission is that understood admiral?
yes sir
and i will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the president  john paul jones you don't understand a thing do you admiral?
yes
and it can be relayed beyond comrade khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
of course our pledge can be relayed to any government official secretary khruschev sees fit to satisfy
tomorrow
you wish
tomorrow
where the hell are you?
did you have any indication of this from georgi? any possible warning or sense of motivation?
complete snowjob and then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into cuba  by the way you realize we just lost the midterms
so if there are alternatives that make sense  and i'm not saying there are  we need 'em need 'em fast
what about the allies? congress? i think we may need to start letting key people know and they're all scattered across the country for the campaign we're going to need to get the un staff in and warmed up jesus i don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the soviets got that cryptographer of ours
we can't worry about everything right now we've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it
tonight listening to taylor and acheson i kept seeing burke and dulles telling me all i had to do was sign on the dotted line the invasion would succeed castro would be gone just like that easy
we keep 'em in the dark as long as we can but i sure as hell am going to test him
we're split down the middle if i held a vote i think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two
if you found me steppin' on your crime scene  it might piss you off too  what about the report?
that's not playing by the rules
i want a consensus bobby consensus either air strike or blockade something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it i need it by saturday make it happen
what if i can't?
then you'll call right?
somebody had to say it i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser
we have to pull him he's not going to be able to handle the soviets in front of the un zorin will eat him alive
we've got bigger problems right now
mcnamara's on his way back here now we need to pick the right ship no subs no armed boarding parties either we need a little more time to figure this one out
that's all well and good but what do we say to 'em?
he didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons
yeah but the country didn't even exist as a country yet it was a mess and he didn't have a leg to stand on
rules are made to be broken
doesn't matter to me if i went down in history like adams i'd die happy all they say about him today is 
you mean there's something more important than votes? didn't think i'd live to see the day ken
i know cia and the military fucked us on the bay of pigs
they're going to be pressing for a military solution soon we can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here
we got a bunch of smart guys we lock 'em up together in there kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options
it's too politicized with you in there anyway they need to be able to stick their necks out
it'll be the principals a couple of the key guys from each department: the executive committee of the national security council we'll call it excom
he's right and things are happening too fast it smells like the bay of pigs all over again
give it a rest you were thinking the same thing just didn't have the guts to take the heat
rescind the order can all the chiefs put nitze gilpatric and the undersecretaries in charge
if you say so
we can't do that bobby
you can't take him out this late in the game
zorin will eat him alive
then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble
what's gotten into you?
something your father would've come up with
 i'm just trying to make a point this idea is that fucking bad
he better because nobody thinks he's up to this nobody
helen and i went out for breakfast excom's not supposed to convene til eight
we just got a second letter from khruschev the deal's off
i do
what does the letter say?
they want us to take our missiles out of turkey along with the no invasion pledge it looks like fomin was a ploy after all and they were just stalling for time
and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey
the jupiters are obsolete they were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway 
 jesus mary and joseph i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article but you wouldn't listen to me what if there hasn't been a coup at all? what if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
so now you've got to talk him out of it and then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution
and if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else
smoke
just wanted to see for myself  they're burning their documents
did i? my mistake
kenny it's over
no ken i need to see him now
cuba
i just checked myself  they're being issued identity cards call comes and evacuation officers meet them at prearranged departure areas they go by helicopter to mount weather we meet them there
i think it's a bad idea
then they should speak up
christ ken you know it's not that easy
yes it is
no it isn't they don't trust the people that feel this way but these people are right and the kennedys are wrong  we need you to tell 'em kenny they'll listen to you
 you listen to me nobody nobody talks about my friends that way you're fucking here right now because of the kennedys they may be wrong they make mistakes but they're not weak the weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds
you are and it's behind you
you know i don't mean they're weak
yeah
it shouldn't have but it did
says what kenny?
so i understand you correctly if the missiles in cuba were dismantled returned to the soviet union and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them the united states would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade cuba?
that is correct
this is from the highest authority?
yes from the highest authority there are two conditions the un must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles
and of course the un must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the american southeast
time is of the essence
come come you don't really expect me to fall for 
48 hours in 48 hours there can be no deals
mccone's been notified and is coming back from the west coast carter's here though
an invasion
yes sir we can be sure we get all the missiles and we remove castro so this can never happen again
yes sir our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational the invasion happens eight days later
we've just begun the mobilization under cover of a prearranged exercise sir we're looking at another week and a half mr president
still heading for cuba
all right then i guess it's time
we are not at war sir not until we're at defcon 1
general the joint chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the soviets you have signaled an escalation which i had no wish to signal and which i did not approve
ugh 
mr president there is another possibility we haven't considered this may not be a coup at all
understood sir we need to step up the overflights finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes
the soviets are in control of the sams it's hard to believe with their centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch
kids are supposed to get detention
i don't know helen i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow leave the tv on sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off
what's happened?
nothing nothing you don't know about tomorrow's the big day just have the car ready to go if i call or if the civil defense warning comes on
what happens to you? i'm not leaving without you
i'll be evacuated with the president
 we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president i think we've won
debbie's marrying rick
a thing like this who could even think of winning?
no i'm glad i'm home
busy but you've got his heart
i want an hour with him
i said his heart not his attention
three weeks before midterm elections? you need me
well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about
i'm doing a piece on skybolt i hear macmillan's meeting with him in nassau
forget it scotty
let him talk to me he makes macmillan look good i print it the british public likes it macmillan owes you
really?
tell you what we're in connecticut tomorrow for ribicoff i'll get you up front with him during the flight
deal
he was
yeah? who was he talking to? acheson? come on o'donnell everyone's wondering what's going on what's acheson doing in town? and don't give me some bullshit about dnc think tanks acheson's mr cold war
why don't you ask him yourself? you can have him on the way home
i'm giving you a chance here: talk to me you can influence how this thing unfolds
well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi
this is about cuba
dean rusk
wrong and you get to wax my car
you were right they were both dead before the fire  the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine  that's usually an indicator of something personal
really  you went with him for two years
yeah
i uh
what about you? where are you going?
back to work
no you weren't
i was you bastard
today for your information is pulaski day we're going to buffalo
not as far as the election goes
good
there've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them
deb i want to throw you a shower
then we need to do a few things right away no pierre he knows the press knows you're going to have to keep up your schedule  your movements are followed too closely and we need to get these guys out of the white house george ball's got a conference room at state  reconvene over there this afternoon come back here tonight
acheson's scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone
there is no expert on this subject no wise old man
cheer up you've neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day
you don't show for chicago everyone'll know there's something going on
i don't care cancel it
no way
you're scared to cancel on daly
damn right i'm scared
i don't know i don't know
check out the other guy's buns
they want this fucking job they can have it it's no great joy to me
in the morning i'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room mcnamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon keep an eye on things there
all right 'cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships shots being fired across bows
i know i know
what about these lowlevel flights? they're starting in what? an hour? do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
we need those flights we have to know when those missiles become operational because when they do we need to destroy them
fair enough but castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites on the deck there's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras not bombs they're going to be shot at plain and simple
i'm gonna protect those pilots
maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on at the very least they believe it's in our best interest and at the end of the day they may end up being right
any problems you remind them those chains of commands end at one place me
bobbie what are you talking about?
have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too
and we can't purge the chiefs our invasion talk will look like a bluff or even that there's been an attempted coup
oh just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the soviets'll do the same in cuba
if we made a trade we'd be giving in to extortion and nato would never trust us again we'll get clobbered in world opinion
it's a goddman trial balloon trial is the operative word here
then somebody'd better deny it publicly
yeah a good political solution
zorin must not have gotten instructions somebody in their foreign ministry's blown it bigtime
i've got to move what do you have kenny?
they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies
o'neill just tole me it's sooo great i don't believe it
you're sure
don't take it to court but we've got good circumstantial evidence  walter agrees my gut's telling me khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message
okay ken we're going
and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it
of course it is but the president needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually
listen to me goddamn it we're talking about a possible nuclear war you dropped the ball on bay of pigs 
 you sonofabitch goddamn it i didn't drop 
you were in the room it was your purview it was your job to make sure bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it you've got the most important job in the world right now you're the smartest guy the president has  besides me
and if this is a move to appease the hard line then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house
why else would they approach us in this way? it's deniable the soviets have done nothing but lie to us this could be more of the same
he's not gonna be happy and your parents can't be too thrilled either
that may be why khruschev's introducing this guy we've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels so he brings in an honest broker
that may be what they want us to think
jesus christ
six months from now i'm not going to care are you? we'll deal with it
sleep is for the weak mr president
we've worked up several military scenarios before i ask general taylor to lead us through the various options i'd like for us to adopt a rule if we are going to strike we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational because once they are i don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched
i'm afraid not mr president the sub has positioned itself between the pierce and the soviet ships admiral anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters the pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub
mr president we're receiving reports that the ships are stopping
captain belay that order  bob where's that coming from
just a second mr president
no as far as they're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick but i don't care it's my decision
will somebody find out what's going on?
hey nice tie
don't get too attached
you're my hero carl
heroes ain't supposed to shake i'm shakin' man look at me
breathe carl four nice deep ones
rug samples
we are onedimensional boring peddlers of fine carpet carl
don't have one carl i have a number man just like the numbers on those treasury checks you stole from your own country carl shame on you

 don't "man" me jimmy where's the key?
oh yeah  right
sioux indian right?
it's not the first there's been several and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat none of the investigations have turned up jack shit
the main problem is ray these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders nonindians relations have not been amicable
different culture hard to penetrate the indians don't like white cops poking around and that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent
i forgot to tell you yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of o'neill's car
leo's been out here too long man i'm taking him to ceremonial burial
it ain't geronimo
who are you?
i think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit yeah? this is the bear creek indian reservation

goodbye
his mother needs a piece of his hair it's for the keeping of the souls ceremony  has to be kept for four days
no ray you're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother
seven
jesus
the agents who have worked out here say its like going into nam unfamiliar terrain foreign language foreign customs and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds they hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here
airborne that's where they used to get us agents from now we get 'em from carnegiemelon ivy league accountants and computer whizkids yuppies with guns  that's scary shit
nah everything's cool i took care of 'em 
you crashed my file?
no i consulted it we're going into indian country i wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass don't you?

ray
check him out ray

 a fucking cop
we'll have to give leo a refund because he's gotta go to the me in case you don't know officer violation of the major crimes act on

i've got the doer i know who he is
cooch you're my hero
one of the leaders of the warriors of all red nations militant organization
right in here the big show starts in one minute
that's right
jimmy looks twice put leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago and threatened him several times since president clear moon and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat
easy cowboy no vendettas on my ship now: remember what i told you about nam? watch the grass watch the trees watch the shit house be on your toes and if we get committed don't hesitate to empty that sucker
alright alright
she talks a lot of shit we're not doing our job jimmy's innocent "what's the fbi really doing here" some shit about the fort laramie treaty
let's see it
i gave it back to her
why we setting eagle bear up as an informant?
her own people start to suspect her it creates discord from within the warriors don't know who to trust they start infighting and jimmy loses his support
cooch what's the fort laramie treaty?
rick's got an important announcement to make
jesus i don't know you tell me you're the indian
a long way from home you be careful out there
whoever dusted leo dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands jimmy looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car it's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving his parents were killed in a car wreck
when did we get that?
today and now you  there's a dog in the van 
 i know i fed it and i can't get rid of 
you weren't sent here to go off on your own detail ray you were sent here to assist in a selective operations unit these regional agents are inept  that's why they were sent out here to the graveyard to indian country i need you behind me ray not pulling against me
i'm not trying to pull against you cooch i've just been having nightmares about the way leo was killed
your first homicide that's gonna happen ray
i just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer
yeah what is it?
ray i never get into bed with somebody unless i know for sure just the way i was raised
yeah alright alright  fuck you  give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world go get a tail on eagle bear and stay with her cuz jimmy's gonna show and i want you to make the collar

 never mind eagle bear we've got jimmy nailed let's go
why?
cuz i want new york
you didn't tell me about red deer table 
 what the hell is red deer table?
yeah right all the things that make life worth living
what is it? it's genocide that's what it is it's a pay zone for some us corporation and a dead zone for the people here uranium cooch
 if they mine uranium there these people will have no place left to go
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters ray i don't know about uranium i don't know about red dog table  all i know is we did our job it's over
we neutralized anybody with a voice leo jimmy eagle bear anyone who was standing in the way of the land is that it?
no we neutralized enemies of the united states antiamerican radicals who have killed federal officers out here
no way cooch
let the press through
after we've completed our investigation
watch out
you're steppin' on sign
chulo one thing at a time
 leo wasn't killed here he was dumped here out of a vehicle bald tread muffler held on with baling wire
bullshit
 well maybe twoseventeen
you're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
no not just a track you gotta listen to the trees man to the leaves to this sand you fbi's kicked all up you gotta listen to the earth
is that right? well listen to this: drag your ass this is a restricted area
no this is the home of the oglala sioux and i want the dogfucker who killed leo whether you get him or i get him i just want him shit's been goin' on too long
you've got no jurisdiction
you got no knowhow about indian way or about jack shit for that matter
maybe you're not aware of this crow horse but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods psycholingusitics dna fingerprinting; i don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers leo was killed right here
sex is my one thing i'm good at it
go back to the me take a look inside leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there trust me there ain't chickens in the badlands his mother's place is 
 his mother never lived here she was from up in north dakota
i'm talkin' his spiritual mother maisy blue legs
his spiritual mother
to us indians our spiritual relatives are as close as family i've got seven mothers on this reservation sisters brothers you ain't one of them
thank god now listen to me asshole i'm giving you a break but if my partner finds out you're here you're gonna be reading rat tracks in sioux falls maximum security
easy easy i'm goin'
is that right? what are the trees saying today?
they're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own but they did say there's somebody way across the little walking river who wants to talk to you
let's go
hmmmm
women
medicine as in medicine man?
good question hardly sees anybody anymore hasn't left this place in twenty years did you bring some tobacco?
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted  a trickster
he knows me?
he says he saw you in a vision some time ago
sacred herbs tobacco don't worry we don't smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe that's a white man's myth this is a sacrament
he said he doesn't know
he just did the gettysburg address in sioux what did he say?
why should i tell you
because he was talking to me
we're going for a little liquid refreshment
and
he saw an owl
the owl is a messenger when one shows itself to a sioux it means someone's gonna die the owl told him about leo
he also said "listen to the water"
listen to the water listen to the owl he also said don't trust the fucking cookie monster
go back to your dna fingerprintin'
i see forgive my cultural ignorance
she's your sister?
 leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard he came out approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy he tried to get back into the trailer but the car came highballing at him he started running for the open grass with the car moving jimmy hung his shotgun out the window took aim  missed once hitting the shitter  fired again and severed leo's spine leo fell rolled and came to a stop in the grass and some chicken feed stale chicken feed with four days mold  electromagnetic printing
i don't see the connection
great i'll go with you wait a second hey raul move that car will you?
the connection is it did a head number on him he's petrified of cars won't drive i've known him all my life and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle he rides passenger and he rides horses and that's it the man that shot leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car
you want solid? that one single print he left in the badlands  the one the fbi missed and then stepped all over  it belongs to a man who walks heels first like a white man jimmy has a serious ind'n walk  ball of the foot first the man who murdered leo walked like a wasi'cu

we're standin' on broken treaty ground ray this ain't supposed to be here it'll poison the water

is that like an hereditary thing magdelana or can one take classes?
maybe you don't care about that either  prettiest suspect i've had in awhile
i'd like to jerk and press those babies
jimmy didn't kill leo why do you wanna do this?
he tried to kill him twice before that's a good place to start don't ya think? leo was on the other side wasn't he?
 leo was an apple that's right red on the outside white on the inside and jimmy hated him kicked his ass a coupla times but he didn't kill him
who did?
you're the fbi that's your job isn't it? ya know how many of our warrior brothers got killed out here? i never saw any investigating then why now? what's going down here?
a fugitive alert for a murder suspect before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine
try the fort laramie treaty all over again
i'm from minneapolis fifth street i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res so i know about the other world ray
when you see jimmy tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in the sooner we back off this reservation okay?
move it magdelana
bond james bond
 you desecrated it it had to be burned
i desecrated it?
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal you've tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation with letters i never wrote you've been watching me eat work raise my family wash myself in the river and now you're here arresting me at a sacred place  in your eyes that's power

simple deduction it's fast it's pretty sleek and stylishit's your colormatches your lipstick
that's all
and i asked someone charlie you think you're pretty smart
not interested
no i beg yours but i don't think you're right on that
why not?
i saw one
you saw a mig 21?
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive
where did you see that?
it's classified
it's classified like hollywood says i could tell you but then i'd have to kill you
not in this case charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g?
yes ma'am
okay ten thousand plus a ge toaster oven a litton microwave a cuisinart
where were you?
on his six
yes ma'am at first then i was directly above him
i was inverted
two miles
two meters
you know the finger
you let me make a fool of myself
you seemed determined to do that anyway why didn't you tell me you were a famous mig insulter? maverick would it have made a difference?
no
in 9th  for a month
who says she's a suspect?
i'm marrying debbie
what would?
you know i'm assigned to this school i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks your attention is flattering but not really productive why don't you keep your mind on flying
and far too aggressive
it is combat every second counts
for what?
that stuff about the mig i was out of line
apology acknowledged
is that all? charlie what else do you want?
um you
there you go with those moves again
michelin tires brand new a set of sears best metric tools
too aggressive?
i don't mix with the boys i work here let's keep it professional
i'm special
yes i'll give you that
give me a break i'm asking you out
i thought there was something that night in the club
lieutenant
evan or maverick
maverickyou know the rules of engagement
the what?
what is this person's story here?
some one comes up hot on your six what do you do?
what are you talking about?
you turn into him check him out identify friend or foe
i'm not your foe charlie and if he's harmless you disengage
harmless
uh hum
what if he's not?
you have to shoot him downif he's smart he'll turn away before that happens
don't worry i'm a new strain and i don't give up everything i've ever wanted i've had to work like hell for well how about it?
how about what?
he's gonna hurt you debbie he'll never be true to you the way i would
how about anything anything you want to do
hard to argue with that isn't it
a date coffee a drinka walk in the park
what about the plane?
what plane
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpitplay with the levers and things maverick well get used to it
used to what?
i'm different
i'm starting to sense that now
make what?
thank you we'll all keep that in mind 'bye now
anything
okay anything justgo i've gotta work

you're an animal
that's true what are you?
i don't enjoy watching things suffer
it's not suffering anymore
you're horrible
you're not cause you eat frozen meatballs?    things die every time you breathe you kill millions of tiny organisms every time you eat something had to die
you don't have to kill it
ah cole  i don't remember ordering an asshole from room service
somebody does it's more honest this way you do your own dirty work
you ever think about killing another human being?
about as much as they think about killing me
they know the rules that's the deal that's why you're up there it's him or me that's the price of admission  it bothers you why? you're part of it   everybody dies most people don't get to die for something
you don't believe any of this you don't think you'll ever die
that's it of course when i'm up there and doing it i'm cheating it every second i'm subverting all lawsgravitywhatever i'm skating the edge of it
winston churchill
all you've got is one life i guess it's worth about the same to every body you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous you can look ahead maybe ten seconds that's your whole future that's as far as it goes but imagine what those seconds are worth
what if you kill yourself? think of everything you'll miss maverick there is lots of stuff i don't know about  fine wine great art the opera i guess if i live long enough i'll get to it if i don't i'll never miss it
are you really that brave?
oh come on just a little
i watched my mother die cancer she had a long time to think about it they say you reach an agreement with death come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here i didn't see that she was very bravebraver than i am you go up there there isn't time to think if you make a mistake you're just a smudge on the ground simplifies funeral arrangements
it's just as i thought
what?
thanks very much  care for some suchi?
where?
you want to go ballistic?
i don't know i don't like being out of control
and now?
and now i want you
you always get what you want?
i'm ready to make you another deal
i don't know yet
anything
no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk by anyone
why?
i'm a professional you guys are in my line of work
in that order?
well noinverse order
i'm still second best
you ever fly an f14? 
i don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies
ooh be still my heart
 yeah
doesn't it ever bother you?
why what's gonna happen?
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross
just good luck
where'd you get it
pawn shop what's to eat?
i'm fine
this is it then
what?
see that down there? that's my most prized possession my new porsche
the dark side the price you pay for all the fun you're having you knew about it of course didn't you?
he was a friend of mine a good guygreat guy it was my fault
that's not what i hear
i was flyingmy responsibility
that's what you get flight pay for
maybe i shouldn't take it
why? you act like you didn't know one day this would happen
not to me
you knew it you all do it's part of it maybe the most important part
where are we? you know where we are it's called the beach it's where life first crawled up out of the sea i come here sometimes when i feel like crawling back in
look i'm not even sure she has anything to do with this  i saw her outside after the fire  thought it was a lead maybe she saw something  maybe she was visiting somebody here  who knows?
the best
you don't have to do this
do what show you a good time?
i'm not good company i should be alone
i don't think so but if that's what you want
what do you want?
i want it back
what?
yesterday
that's what i want
of course the line's just imaginary you can cross it twenty timesnothing really changes
i love that car
hardly ever
only when you're depressed then it passes
it does
everything passes immutable law of the universe
i sit i think i play games
what kind of games?
i like to play "reality"
it's strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play
strip reality how do you play that?
it's like strip poker only without the bluffing  one person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off
i'm very happy for you two
you're crazy  that's a pretty silly game
not as silly as some you know the silliest one? that we are gods that we control events on the beach that we can turn back time
how does it go?
you say the truth  go ahead don't be afraid you want to win the game don'tcha?
what truth?
the big one the one that's most on your mind
true
now?
take something off
off me or off you?
the car for debbie?
that's up to you
that wasn't fair it was a question penalty round
that's three
and that's one
your watch
who's gonna win?
we'll say it together on the count of threeonetwo
i was later
long distance? i wouldn't do that to you i'd at least talk to you
i didn't want to see you i mean i didbut i didn't
i mean it the car is yours dump debbie
i know exactly what you mean
how could you?
i've got a gift just like you do my gift is i just know what people mean even if they can't say it it helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots like what you just said was "i'm embarrassed i feel i've done something wrong that i've failed and i don't think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting intelligent woman like yourself" that about it?
something like that
big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer
hey i never said i was a fighter piloti never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm i can find contentment in a good book i don't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire sometimesi just get happy being with the right man
i hope you find him
i think i have i could be wrong i have been before just remember one thing if you're not top gun if you're not fighting jets you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot you're gonna have to act like the rest of us you're gonna have to master humility for you guys that's the toughest maneuver of all
well what?
you got your f14 you got top gun you got your migsyou're our new top gun instructornow what?
gee guys what should i do? the car or debbie?
ohi'll think of something what are you doing here?

why do they call you wolf?
yes son did you find out where the bachelor party is?
on what?
well it doesn't just happen you gotta do something famous
like what?
ohi'll think of something
what do you think it was? was it that mig contact that did it?
did what?
got you here
we're here because we're the best flyers in the wing not because of some mig encounter
we won ice turns back stares them down then turns back into his locker dismissing them
below the hard deck doesn't count you guys are the second team aren't you?
yes i did
why goose whose butt did you kiss to get here?
the list is long but distinguished
so's my johnson
this is maverick
who's your pilot?
tom kazansky
no shit the iceman
mister to you
i think yeah we'll show you a thing or two
this is evan mitchell he steers the thing
fine how's everything going?
so i heard steers it pretty close sorry to hear about cougar he was a good man
flaming hooker sort of an institution around here or maybe this is the institution i forget which it's the house drink it'll warm the cockles of your heart  and other things depending on where you spill it
could use a dash more jet fuel
hey see any controls back there?  and anywaywe beat the son of a bitch
cougar you're on the ball
nothingthat's mcgownthat's singer isn't it? goose turn around pay attention what are you doing?
is there anybody in the navy you don't know?
gotta keep track of the competition
what been drunk? sure plenty
yeah he's marriedbut then again hes not dead

pay no attention to it they're just trying to rattle you it's all psychological sit downand drink
on your six  coming hard four hundred losing airspeed he's on your six and closing fast hard left hard left
he should've had me goose take it down let's bug out of here call for a draw
look ma top of the world

i wouldn't call it victory  it's more likeself immolation
come on relax
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders? oh no i think that was johnson air boss of the kitty hawk
come on we beat an instructor how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
just once if they take your plane away
not at all we're just finishing lunch
what?
come on i got over six bucks on the line
i've had enoughfor now
don't chew it you won't have it that long easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks
nothing let's just go fight
bogey at three o'clock high nose on
i'm gonna take him goose
don't be greedy stay with wood
i want him
wood's okay i want viper
sure have
i guess that's what i'm doing then
where do you find the time? where do you find the energy it's tough enough to keep your mind on school a woman here is a real pain in the
time to go
i can't eject
go ahead i can't reach 2000 feet
let's go eject
no shit that why they call him ice?
nope it's the way he flies  ice cold no mistakes wears you down after enough time you just get bored and frustrated you do something stupid and he's got you
come on i died enough for one night
they should have warned you about that one
or czechoslovakia  the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years  these are very intense people and they take things personally
thank you sir
she's kinky for flight suitssaid that she'd never seen so many zippersplayed with them all night the noise alone kept me up
what'd you do?
pulled left rolled out underneath
don't
was
skipper you can't do this
i didn't do it he did it himself something about a wife and kid the fact is he's lost it he knows it i know it you were up there you know it too goose give him a break skipper it was raining snakes up there he'll be alright soon as all the gorillas go home
well you'll just have to make do with him 
he's a hell of a flyer in fact he's so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself except for one thing  he just can't seem to follow orders
it's not the plaque the winner can get assigned here as instructor he gets to fight every day
i know you're as unhappy as i am about debbie's marriage to rick
thirty seconds that's all it took to blow us out of the sky
that's because you don't have any women
until last night did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party?
the girl with the purple fingernails?
that's hertall hungry woman with fire in her eyes it was great
i didn't ruin her
what now?
he won again
got 'em
shit
yes sir i am
stay where you are he's mine i'm engaged i'm in
fire or clear out ice
get lost
you got too much nose to tail  i'm coming in
it's my shot
stay out of it stay out of it maverick
you can't shoot him i can i'm in
no no no he's mine
no i got him i can take him
look out
cole i don't want you to give up on her
got 'em got good tone
i can't lose him can you get off a shot?
i got no tone it might get you
what choice do i have?   shoot it
when i shoot you break left32
you don't owe me anything we're on the same team
you saved our lives you did it
we did it
you're a hell of a flyer  you can be my wingman any time
no you can be mine
i've tried to change her mind
figured out what?
who is the best
nope
need a hint?
i think i can work it out on my own
you like to work alone i've heard that about you
i've heard of you too you were in 124 with bargamian
and you were with cougar he was my roommate in flight school
just below ten thousand
but you continued to fight
it's not her mind you need to change it's disneyland head in there
tell me one thing
yeah we get one of these guys every damn class   "maverick"
not only that but zorro got your wingman nice going
it's only been a week keep sending him up
i've seen this before
so have i
some guys never get it back
three guesses
well he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet
speaking of feet fuel's down to 40  we're gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station
but how can i do that?
cougar this is maverick  i'm getting hungry let's head for the barn cougar where are you?
what the hell you doing?
helping him in
what makes you think we can get back in?  we don't have the fuel for this maverick just get me to him
didn't everybody?
bad?
the girl with the purple fingernails was coogan's sister
no really she came ruined ya think he knows it was me?
how's it goin' coog?
i talked a man back once three months later we lost him it's his decision only he knows
if it were me i'd reason with him first then if that failed  i'd take more persuasive action
me?
sir?
that is all tell me about the mig some other time
yes sir
the wings
yes sir
i like that in a fighter pilot  it's okay to be confident you have to think you're king kong to want to try to land on carriers just keep in mind the other component of successteamwork
ahhh runs in the family sir
you're father was marvin mitchell
yes sir
keep me informed
a good man good flyer
is that how you remember it?
we weren't below for more than ten seconds there was no danger i had the shot i took it
the rules of engagement are not flexible they exist for your safety you will obey them is that clear?
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane
engaging the other guy wood you're on your own
i lost
of course you did i said a great flyer not a smart one you fly reckless great instincts no discipline that ambush today you followed your emotions instead of your wingman of course you got killedand well deserved to it was a really stupid mistake in battle it gets people killed
talent is no holy shield von richtofen was killed by a farm boy instincts are not enough do it our way we've worked these things out the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive    why do you have to do everything the hard way?
it's my own way it works for me i don't care about the rest of that stuff
what? i'm sorry sir i can't hear you
then why are you here?
for the same reason you are
oh you mean the thrill
the flying the fighting  i'd go up there ten times a day to fight i'd win at least nine of them that's all i want to do it's what i do best i am real good  just give me the jet
all right
goose is dead
i know i was there
my first squadron in vietnam we lost eight out of eighteen planes ten guys the first one kills you but there'll be othersyou can count on it
no bother
i called your house
there wasn't a fire  there'll be nothing for you to do
well tell the asshole to shut up
my wife's house
she said you took your kid to the each every second sunday zoo or beach or the ballgame y'have the option what about me?
or
or you can quit
i don't know
i didn't know either that's why i told jester to prepare your papers
you think i should quit?
i didn't say that that's up to you but i have responsibility for the other guys up there not just you they need to know you're all rightthat they can depend on you
i know
vf 51 the oriskany you remind me of him you're just like he was only betterand worse
right  hey shut up okay sir
i'm nothing like him
you may not think so but you are
he was by the book all the way
they waved him off he thought he knew better he hit the ramp
i never heard that
not something they tell dependents
it's not true
kid the plain fact isyou are i'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass technically they absolved you you and i know what really happened you pushed it you are responsible and you'll always carry that you know what i'll carry it too i should have taken you out of that cockpit i guess i'm a hopeless romantic i always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death it's no tradeoff it's not one for one what you learned isn't worth his death it couldn't be but maybe there is some value in it i know it's the first thing i've ever seen that's really gotten to you now the question is what will you do with it if it gets you out of flight statusso you don't kill yourself or anybody elsethat's good that's one good thing you were an accident waiting to happen
you think i shouldn't fly
i didn't say that that's up to you i think that if you do if you choose to come back you'll be a better pilot a better man
sorry i can't hear you some pin head's yelling  shut up i'm talking here  now look i want you to go back and i don't care what you do stop that marriage
would you take me back? would they?
i'll have to think about it i don't know about them i do know one thing we've got a lot invested in you we'd hate to lose it even more than those other guys naval aviation needs a very few very good men
he ain't got five kids to feed
over there man
you got the job
what was that?  an accident?
oh the usual  more money more freedom more air
the last resort
you're getting off to an early start
yeahwell actually nosort of
the bachelor party's upstairs they made me get naked they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down
man don't know if he's been to mars or not
freaks?'fraid so man  goes with the territory
what happened to them?
cheap domes  and no air to screen out the rays
why not?
i know a much better place down the block  the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down
and you get a kickback
take me to the hotel
ah shit  you got me  i ain't even married  now put your fucking hands in the air
the last resort  quick

impossible  once the reaction starts it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet  mars will go into global meltdownthat's why the aliens never turned it on
do you expect me to believe you?
who gives a shit what you believe? in thirty seconds you'll be dead then i'll blow this place up
i am quaid
you're nothing  you're nobody  you're a stupid dream  well all dreams come to an end
i'm trying to neutralize a traitor
if i wanted him dead you moron i wouldn't have dumped him on earth
we can't let him run around  he knows too much
lori says he can't remember jack shit
that's now  in an hour he could have total recall
over here deb in the smokehouse
listen to me richter i want quaid delivered alive for reimplantation have you got that?  i want him back in place with lori
no sir
because i've got the greatest job in the solar system  as long as the turbinium keeps flowing i can do anything i want  anything  if fact the only thing i ever worry about is that one day if the rebels win it all might end
i know that
but i thought
who told you to think?  i don't give you enough information to think  you do what you're told  that's what you do
yes sir
yes sir
great  because otherwise i'll erase your ass
they've got quaid  they're protecting him
finally realized rick's a jerk huh?
perfectget out of sector g  now don't think  do it
yes sir
don't be an idiot
it's about goddamn time
what is it?
you better get down here
looks like another schizoid embolism
it's not my fault  we hit a memory cap
use your head you dumb bitch  he's acting out the secret agent role from his ego trip
i'm afraid that's not possible
i can watch you eddie  maybe i'll learn something
no cole i
why not?
we haven't implanted it yet
i've been trying to tell you  someone erased his memory
i'll do what i can  it's getting messy in there
ernie dump him in a cab  around the corner  tiffany you help him  i'll destroy his file and refund his money  and if anybody comes askingwe've never heard of douglas quaid
come onput his head in place
nice to meet you
don't you keep up with the news?  we're doing alien artifacts now
eight years
i see  slipping away for a little hankypanky
it's all right i forgive you i'm not the vengeful type we'll forget what happened why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas
not really  i've just always been fascinated by mars
hetero
hmmm  and how do you like your women?
brunette
slim athletic voluptuous?
sleazyand demure
fortyone a ernie
this is going to be very difficult for you at accept mr quaid
i'm listening
i'm afraid you're not really standing here right now
cole listen to me i've got to tell you
i'm quite serious  you're not here and neither am i
at rekall
oh i get it; i'm dreaming  and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me
not exactly  what you're experiencing is a freeform delusion based on our memory tapes  but you're inventing it yourself as you go along
well if this is my delusion who invited you?
i've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure  i'm sorry to tell you this mr quaid but you've suffered a schizoid embolism we can't snap you out of your fantasy i've been sent in to try to talk you down
how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
think about it  your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure everything after thatthe chases the trip to mars your suite here at the hiltonthese are all elements of your rekall holiday  and ego trip: you paid to be a secret agent
bullshit  it's all coincidence
what about the girl?  brunette athletic sleazy and demure; just like you specified  is that a coincidence?
you know when you dumped me for that wimp i thought cole she'll be back god wants the two of you to be together and sure enough
she's real  i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall
mr quaid can you hear yourself? "she's real because you dreamed her?"
that's right
no need to be rude  i'll do it
swallow this
it's a symbol  of your desire to return to reality inside your dream you'll fall asleep
any news of quaid?
not since you lost him
watch your mouth captain
where?
cole i'm marrying rick
there  the woman
arrest that woman
this is richter siri've got them pinned down
ok everybody pull out
relax you'll live longer
we don't have much choice then do we?
where's kuato?
on his way
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine?
yeah
you're marrying him? then why are you coming back to me?
cohaagen found something weird inside and it's got him scared shitless
what aliens?
you tell me
i don't know
yes you do  that's why we brought you here    cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain  and kuato's  gonna dig it out
you're kuato right?
wrong  kuato's a mutant  so don't get upset when you see him
c'mon

let's do it
do what?
move to mars
just think about it
sweetheart we've been through this a million times  you'd hate it on mars it's dry; it's ugly; it's boring  i mean really a revolution could break out there any minute
cohaagen says it's just a few extremists
and you believe him?
what are we having?
all right forget about it
lori move
there's lots nicer places than mars
i'm late
lori don't you understand?  i feel i was meant for something more than this  i want to do something with my lifei want to be somebody
bye
some men just tried to kill me
no  spies or something  and harry from workget down
take it easy  tell me exactly what happened?  why would "spies" want to kill you?
i don't know  it had something to do with mars
it's either meatloaf swiss steak or charred flesh i won't know till it's finished
mars?  you've never even been to mars
i know it sounds crazy but i went to this rekall place after work and
you went to those brain butchers?
let me finish
what did they do to you?  tell me
i got a trip to mars
oh god doug
forget rekall will you  these men were going to kill me
doug nobody tried to kill you
they did  but i killed them
i think your dinner's burning
doug
i'm not your wife
the hell you're not
i swear to godi never saw you before six weeks ago  our marriage is just a memory implant  agghh
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
it was implanted by the agency
and falling in love?
implanted
our friends my job eight years together i suppose all this was implanted too?
the job's real  but the agency set it up
want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower it's really gonna be fun
bullshit
beats me  i just work here
i'm honored
you sure you don't wanna?  for old time's sake  if you don't trust me you can tie me up
i didn't know you were so kinky
it's time you found out
dougyou wouldn't shoot me would you?  after all we've been through?
yeah  some of it was fun
i'm here at rekall
right  that's why you tried to kill me
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me
nooo  i would never do anything to hurt you  i want you to come back to me
bullshit
doug don't
nice to meet you
good to see ya right this way
mars
right  mars
that a problem?
to be perfectly honest with you doug if outer space is your thing i think you'd be much happier  with one of our saturn cruiseseverybody raves about 'em
i'm not interested in saturn  i said mars
you're going to have a bachelor party?
okay you're the boss  mars it is
what's in the two week package?
first of all doug when you go rekall you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the hilton; plus all the major sights:  mount pyramid the grand canals and of course  venusville
how real does it seem?
as real as any memory in your head
come on don't bullshit me
i'm telling you doug your brain won't know the difference  guaranteed or your money back
what about the guy you lobotomizeddid he get a refund?
you're talking ancient history doug nowadays traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket  look at the statistics
smart move  now while you fill out the questionnaire i'll familiarize you with some of our options
of course i'm a traditional guy it's a traditional event  well what do you think?
no options
whatever you sayjust answer one question  what is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
you  you're the same  no matter where you go there you are always the same old you  let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself  i know it sounds wild but it's the latest thing in travel we call it an "ego trip"
i'm not interested in that
you're gonna love this we offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip
aaah let me tantalize you  you're a top operative back under deep cover on your most important mission  people are trying to kill you left and right you meet a beautiful exotic woman
i don't wanna spoil it for you doug just rest assured by the time the trip is over you get the girl you kill the bad guys and you save the entire planet  now you tell me  is that worth three hundred measly credits?
what's he talking about?
let me go
i love you
it looks awful
blondes
i think it's still hungry
i guess he didn't
you couldn't get me a message?  you never wondered what happened to me?
there's something i have to tell you
what are you talking about?
i don't remember you  i don't remember us  i don't even remember me
hauser left me a note
hauser?  you're hauser
not any more
my parents are from poland  i can help with the eastern european angle
yes but looks are deceiving  not in this case however
i didn't lose it  cohaagen stole it he found out that hauser switched sidesso he turned him into somebody else  me
this is too weird
then he dumped me on earth with a wife and a lousy job and 
wait did you say wife?are you fuckin' married?
oh she isn't really your wife  how stupid of meshe was hauser's wife
forget i said wife
no let's forget everything  i've had it with you and your goddamn lies
why would i lie to you?
because you're still working for cohaagen
don't be ridiculous
are you going to have women at your party?
you never loved me hauser  you just used me to get inside
inside what?
melina hauser sent me to do something
i'm not falling for it
he said there's enough in here to nail cohaagen for good
get out
melina pleasepeople are trying to kill me
if cohaagen wants you dead you might be okay
kuato wants to see you  come on
jump
no sweetheart it's a stag party does stay home
i used to model for 'em why?
just wondering
i'm not a hooker  that's my cover
i saw them
kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were hauser
like what?
all sorts of things  you might even remember you loved me
i don't need kuato for that
oh since when?
you twofacedbastard
i'm not talking about does i'm talking about hookers
i'm not sure dear?  what do you think?
the reactor
what reactor?
the one in the mine
people are dying quaid  stop  we've got to get air
aliens built it
aliens?
it's just up ahead
of course not  if mars had an atmosphere he's lose control
enough for everybody to breathe?
oh those why do you ask?
i just has a terrible thoughtwhat is this is all a dream?
then kiss me quickbefore you wake up
i gave you?
i'm leaving it here  come get it and keep moving
what?
who are you?
we were buddies in the agency back on mars  you asked me to find you if you disappeared  so here i am goodbye
what was i doing on mars?  damn
damn you know those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out therenext thing the feds will be at our door  "sorry time to move eminent domain"
some kind of mutation?
because from what i've heard it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy
ready as we'll ever be
heather and i are going to drive around a little see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town
one of these days melvin somebody's gonna kick your ass
no problem
good  you've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail  so here's the plan: you and heather go for help get to the mountains
breaker there earl  what do you want us to do?
hang on burt  the bastards are up to something
that's four  let us know if it starts moving burt
roger that
you can't fight'em that way
i can't sleep

i don't know  they're pretty quickfifteen seconds?
cannon fuse
what do <u>you</u> use it for?
my cannon
phone's out  road's out  we're on our own
yeah whatever they are you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace  what the hell's going on in town?
damn  val we can't get them  never figured on having to shoot through dirt  best goddamn bullet stop there is  come back
i think i scared it
i'd go for penetration  the 458 shooting solids  less ammo to carry anyway
oh i got something for that
we sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece
you're never going to believe this but the canyon roadwe were on it not two hours agowell it's completely
burt can you hear me now?
just barely pham  what are you all doing up on your roofs what the hell's going on?  come back
val?  what the hell you doing back already?
burt get out  get up on your roof or someplace  we found out what's been killing people  they're under the ground
what's under the ground?  we're not getting up on the roof  earth shelter's the best  known that since i was a kid
listen  listen  we know what they are  they're big things under the ground  much bigger than we thought  they're coming after you they're coming right now
in a minute
damn it  they'll sink this rig just like a boat
what's the matter?
yeah well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way right?
right  we're gonna run  get ready
well who put you two in charge?
thanks  god i hope they're not screwed up  i might have to bag the whole semester anyway sorry to bother you
no problem  nice meeting you hope you get it sorted out
i don't see any eyesmust be totally subterraneanand those tentacles
i think they shoot right outta its mouth hook you and pull you right in  good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else
yeah i'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>  this is important you know  this is like well let's say it it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century  the century?  forget it  <u>history</u>
probably couldn't move too easily on the surface
i'd vote for outer space  no way those are local boys
i don't know i just feel scared
we're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death
well i was wondering if we could
well i'm scared but i'm not sorry
you know val went to that college too  for a whole year  couldn't quite sit still for it though had too much vinegar in his system but once he settles down forgets this cowboy stuff he'll be one in a million
the mountains are solid granite we'd be safe there and we could hike along themall the way to bixby if we have to
no good  you need major four wheeldrive just to get up that jeep trail
son of a bitchin' lowlife putrid scum
val stop  they're coming  don't move
no  we go straight
could we make it to the mountains?
you're polish?
about what?
nope there  that's one
howdy rhonda
you're really leaving huh?
you bet  you gonna be staying up here?
well yeah  there's going to be major research up here  first thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up
did it yesterday  franks and beans
noit was eggs  i did eggs
hell you did  your turn
i was in one  a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree  three hundred head going hellbent for the horizon  wasn't so damn funny i can  tell you
i keep thinking if we were but half serious about money we should quit being hired hands and
the wedding my parents your family our friends my job the future our relationship the caterers my gown your tuxedo our honeymoon the apartment my shower your bachelor party
handymen earl  we're handymen
whatever the hell we are we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment
has a lot of rain
do not talk to the driver
burt and heather's place is closer let's do their kitchen today  do nestor tomorrow
nestor's out of town tomorrow  we don't dig today  we don't get paid today  damn it valentine you never plan ahead  you never take the long view  hell here it is monday and i'm already working on wednesday  it is monday right?
nah it's september  must be the new one
the new one  that's supposed to be a girl
what the hell do we know about seismographs?
nothing  but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union sweetheart everything's gonna be all right
why?
goddamnit valentine you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z
well sure
and is dumber than my hind end like that bobby lynn dexter
don't matter  they're all the same: dead weight  can't make a decision can't walk because of their shoes can't work because of their fingernails  make my skin crawl
well i'm a victim of circumstance
i thought you called it your pecker  look don't make the mistake i made  twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like miss october 1968 and where'd it get me?  here with you
right  we plan ahead  that way we don't do anything right now  earl explained it to me
you gotta ask <u>that</u>?
we could  we could  but we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious  it's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
so?  that car wash pays good and they're always looking
car wash?  that's got no future if we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that
yeah sure  go ahead and plan itfor a year or two
damn it val  not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this
in the past year i must've said a hundred times "we gotta get out of perfection  we gotta better ourselves"  you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think i'm the reason we're still here?  you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right <u>now</u>?
i'll call that little bluff  how close?
forget it man  it's not worth it
that's the plan
damn straight  now there's nothing between us and bixby but nothing
adios bridge
c'mere
one job i'd never take is working around electricity
especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground
he's only got one damn jacket that's him i'm telling you
if he did why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger
oh sure he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  come on sombody must've chased him up there
oh you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun and then what did they do?  camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
you got that right
okay the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way  we don't stop till we hit the carwash not even to pee
i'll go with that plan
good
what the hell is going on?  i mean what the <u>hell</u> is going on?
well there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now  everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead
val  val
you're hung up again
i am not
hey i don't want spend the night out here
yeah  next time i tell you i'm not hung up
fifteen lousy bucks
a man who plans ahead
relax  a snake thing like that couldn't move too quick
um that's very relaxing
screw you  for all you know they could <u>fly</u>
the rifle
great  thank you
then where's the goddamn conway twitty coming from?
that <u>is</u> the plani mean goddamn it  what the hell are those things?  how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon?
<u>why</u> would they do it?
oh shit
sons of bitches
so this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
sure earl everybody knows about them  we just didn't tell <u>you</u> come on nobody's ever seen one of these  we're really <u>in</u> on something here
now i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland
you got <u>that</u> right
naw don't want to winch it  that'd tear it all up  want to lift it some kind of crane with lifting straps
yeah  where's your truck?
little sons of bitches
okay now how far's your truck?
i think we wait right here
maybe it is  why don't you take a little stroll and see?
fuck you too  pardon my french
son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch  been waiting there all this time  how the hell's it even know we're still here?
it's been listening to us  it's got no eyes  it sure as hell can't smell anything underground so i figure
you better not have too much joy
me too
first let's see if stumpy's still out there
well that's why edgar never got down off that tower
well it's not like we've got a hell of a lot of options
right
right  we need to be talking about what we're gonna do
i'm gonna help you
chuck him out the door  like a little hors d'oeuvre
just about too damn long  bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway
we need another plan
wouldn't think of it because tomorrow  we're going to the chapel and we're
jesus  it's slower than hell
yeah but it weighs better than thirty tons  no way they could stop it
a car huh?  like a big armored car?  need something bigger tougherour truck maybeor hell that old semi trailer
its tires are flat
doesn't matter  the cat can pull <u>any</u>thing
wellall <u>right</u>  we just roll on out of here
we got a plan
like hell you are
get real  i'm faster than you
<u>i'm</u> best at driving the cat
my folks are
gonna get married
only if something happens to me
don't worry about me jerkoff
i don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there
jesus val it's pretty far
not going to pole vault anywhere that's for sure
hey just 'cause you're no good with a rope
or just knock us over  look use the bomb
it's out last one  we can't kill them all

she wants to lay down  i'm a little worried
damn fred you can't give away all those
forget it  i got vegetables coming out my ears  usually the varmints eat up half my crop but lately i ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jackrabbit nowheres

your honor: i imagine that no matter how careful my questioning mr ortega would in his wellintentioned way dig my client's hole even deeper
i suppose i could find an inmate who'd say that shu boasted about chinatown just to survive in the joint  though he didn't really do it
i would like to put shu's alleged crime in a context your honor and we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room if it please the court i'd like to call mr reynard
i'm a lawyer the firm is thinking about renovating everything dates back to the sixties
i noticed
do you see a toilet here you think is really me?
 i don't care who you are you could've been killed every man and woman in here has done hard prison time and we look out for each other
"we"?
i did five years in attica lot of cons helped me in the joint but i never got help from any lawyer i built this business for guys like me who couldn't get a break anywhere else "art's supplies" is for ex cons not lawyers
c'mon i knew it was you
dowd eddie dowd
if you'd had the sense to ask for my help i might've helped you but you've probably scared chuckie roeder off for good i have a whole bunch of jumpy employees to handle and you're both going to be on your way now
let's snuff this lowlife
hey  the fact you popped jimmy chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated jury'll sympathize  dude was banging your wife right?
shut your sewer mouth
i had a minute before the mapp hearing  but i couldn't get you on the phone eddie
yeah well i had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the fourth amendment
what about entrapment?
can't i take a simple piss without 
not necessarily
rick you're lying
i can describe it
oh really?
it was silver with a stubby barrel snubnosed i think they call it it wasn't automatic it had one of those cylinders
you can't remember that  
i can see the hammer still it was cocked
how can you remember that?
i didn't take my eyes off it
ah
no further questions
we had a description of the suspect
debbie i'm telling you i didn't do anything hardly
a "description"? what asian male 18 to 30 black hair brown eyes?
didn't this "information" come from the joe boys themselves  did they not all but hand you shu kai kim a korean an outsider?
not at all 
kim's prints were all over it  he admitted it was his gun f'r godsake
your honor the witness' response was nonresponsive i ask you to strike it from the record
no no
you fucking swear to shut up
right i forgot we're pledged to protect every midlevel drug dealer in the tristate area  it's an awesome responsibility
i don't venerate drug dealers roger to the contrary
of course
the marriage is off now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life
through use of informants eavesdropping unreasonable search and seizure
right you're right
damn right i'm right
i specialize roger
 an angel dust dealer 
i'm not a kid anymore i can't be all over the map 
 a speed manufacturer 
so go take your job on wall street
don't tell me where to work i moved to new york to work for edward dowd but i can't believe that edward dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little 
hey you plan to be a criminal defense attorney know this going in: everybody's guilty
i don't want that i want to be with you
look  i'm tired i'll see you in the morning eddie
ossining correctional facility sing sing everybody's innocent there man just ask 'em
chinatown street gang
kim denied it but he admitted the gun was his and he got life seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years til the incident with duane lindeman
 the nazi he knifed?
 remember?
with two knives taped to his hands? forget it rog
we're taking the other case
what other case?
eight years ago the chinatown hit
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment
you really think that's what happened?
i don't know but it makes one hell of an opening statement
easy? no we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried to reopen the sucker
are you sure we want that?
eddie i don't know about this
a complaint followup form
 listen: "november 5 1980 cecil stipe walked into 5th precinct says he witnessed chin shooting saw suspect's picture in post says shu kai kim wrong man"
"cecil stipe"? have we seen any affadavit with that name?
what the lunatic who 
"cecil stipe" find it
i am committed i love you
"have to"? no
saving it for the sunday times
 you found his mugshot?
i didn't ask for a closing argument
there's no one else to talk to the tattoos were phony
 yeah?
so an upstanding member of the aryan warriors wouldn't paint them on they take those teardrops seriously  they're badges of courage of honor only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them
i feel much better now
hey clyde gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost we're clyde's buddies it's cool  next exit
george is a fucking burnout case i didn't want him on the stand anyway get more names from billy
you don't believe me? okay fine
a spinal injury in the line of duty it was in kitty's report
roger baron
1530 rivington street
 what?
chuckie's address i sneaked a peek at the rolodex
you sneaked a peek at the rolodex  nice
what do you mean?
well i mean roeder's gone now a dead end believe me i'm sorry too but
but what?
i've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list it's an even ten who say shu's gun killed jimmy chin
yes
that's why i hate experts
eddie it's one thing to compare clyde gruner to jesus christ it's even okay to claim that shu kai kim is just slightly holier than the pope as long as you don't really believe it
hey  you believe what you want shu kai kim is innocent
 eddie
you know how i know? 'cause reynard says he's guilty and reynard's full of shit look 
that's not gonna happen i'm gonna create reasonable doubt buckle your seatbelt and watch me work
i'm not that desperate
i am eddie  we've got nothing
i've got a meeting in chinatown
let's get a cab
you got any better ideas?
great now what do you want to do about it?
 roger  ?
what's art esparza?
i think he hired shu to kill jimmy chin it wasn't a chinatown gang hit  jimmy chin and art's wife were lovers she just about told me
you phoned up art esparza's wife?
i followed her from the courthouse
i've seen this picture before
christ shu is innocent
everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right
least we'd already be at the morgue
 an hour  that's why i thought the morgue was on the other side of town
let's get naked
for ten years now
do you speak cantonese mandarin or both?
 me? neither
neither
and i call your testimony hearsay i have no more questions for you
you're doing a murder case?
it hasn't been that long
eddie i'm not working on this case you boys have fun
beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors
kitty where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
you're on
forget it you've blown your chance to participate in this case kitty
i'm kicking myself eddie right out of here
i was never politically correct enough for comrade dowd
"dowd also reports that his team of private investigators"?
i embroidered
"are close to naming the man they believe actually killed jimmy chin"?
i lied
but i like that theory and since i'm not putting twerp professor on the stand and since i don't have a better theory i'm sticking with that theory meantime i want pictures of the joes what'll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like shu to fool the eyewitnesses
have you considered that chuckie roeder's not calling himself chuckie roeder these days? get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you then canvass those art supplies places we're gonna win this one kitty but ya gotta believe
i didn't put him in a wheelchair reynard did he can get around without one  it's all in my report
yeah
i don't have time to read every word in every report i'm too busy getting killed in court meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where chuckiefuckingroeder works
eddie these things take time particularly at this hour
a number of them are dead three are in prison one's a waiter two  you'll enjoy this  two are actually members of the chamber of commerce
i'm a professional eddie getting paid is all the thanks i require
i haven't paid you
right
you don't drink "booze"
you do
eddie if i wanted to make love with you again i'd do it sober
nothing has but that's all changing
this has been quite a night here's a thought why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
exactly
i don't need sleep
i need sleep some of us are mere mortals
screw you too kitty
that's right
figures
want to tell me what went down here?
racist asshole came at me
exactly what happened then?
i killed the motherfucker
you're so romantic
okay
"painted"?
i guess he wanted you to think he was somebody he wasn't
but why?
maybe because someone's afraid
afraid of what?
i don't know the truth maybe
 about what?
about chinatown what went down
what went down?
ilene why would i want to do that? i trust rick
you tell me man
no you tell me shu
how can i tell you what i don't know
you can't so tell me what you do know  say it
i don't know shit man goddammit 
well i know that you're innocent shu  even if you forgot
"no" what?
it's okay eddie
when i joined up i took an oath of secrecy i told you what you needed to know
it was selfdefense
of course you do i trusted my ex mel too cousin i can only talk from experience what do you think they do at these parties have tea and play scrabble?
jimmy chin? was that selfdefense too?
by trusting me shit man
for awhile we had this dream we were innocent that was our bond but then we woke up and now i'd like to hear everything
seecil
seecil i'm eddie dowd this is roger baron we're lawyers
hey chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency
good now we're going to take an affadavit from you but only concerning the facts of the chinatown shooting we honestly don't give a shit about the kennedy assassination
they ggot the wrong gguy
when the da hears i filed the writ he'll send someone here maybe claiming to be a journalist that person will ask you lots of questions just be truthful cecil okay? to all of us?
i always ttell the truth  that's why i'm here
ilene rick promised
yyes sir
did the police make any attempt to phone you to follow up?
no ssir
thank you mr stipe
mr rabin has no right to 
don reynard
shu kai kim
you won't remember this but in '72 i was one of several prosecutors assigned to the black pantherpolice shootout  we had a whole team and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt  so what've you been up to since then?
this and that
my staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers i said that can't be the same edward dowd
debbie don't be naive men are pigs
it's in the area of narcotics mr reynard that the government tramples on the fourth amendment
let's not drag the constitution into this
your client is guilty don't dick around with me
i'd have that checked mr reynard
are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
yes but that's not the issue what's on your wish list ed? pleading kim out to first degree man on both homicides with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? come on what're you looking for here?
what am i looking for? you're the one talking deal
friday's the dropdead date on the offer
please don't bullshit me mr reynard you've got witness problems you've got proof problems
you're my only problem ed what does it take to make you go away?
mind if i ride along with you?
look you heard what those hookers said they were supposed to go to a bachelor party
that's right
we reconvict your man's looking at 25 years on two counts served consecutively so what i'd like to ask ed is: are you joking?
i never joke about waiving a client's sixth amendment right to trial
you're pissing me off again ed
you know you're very tense mr reynard y'oughta take a week off fly the wife and kids to oahu
but i'm a quick study tell your deputy da  rabin?  that i'll see him in court
no mr dowd you'll see me in court i'm prosecuting this case
that's big of you bob
objection the witness is not an expert in racial classification
isn't it a standard trick to pack a lineup with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
that doesn't mean it was rick's party
argumentative
calls for speculation
badgering
objection
we just discovered him your honor his appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case he is an inmate at ossining correctional and 
 objection your honor this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with
the witness will substantiate mr kim's modus operandi it's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand
the great personal sacrifices endured by mr reynard have no bearing on the legal issues your honor  
your honor i know as much about these gangs as anyone; i'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked i assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime 
 alleged crime 
debbie men are pigs  if they can have women we can have men
 in a context
i'd need a continuance three weeks at least
didn't this investigation with its attendant publicity catapult you into the office you now hold?
if i were sitting where i normally sit i would say "calls for speculation"
mr dowd i was personally involved with all phases  and principals  of the investigation
and who were the detectives who assisted you mr reynard?
the same three detectives on the jimmy chin case
and who was arturo esparza?
 but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation
i can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact
look girls  i'll stay behind and hold them off the rest of you break for it
i didn't say he was an informant but since you mentioned it wasn't esparza your primary informant?
you're trespassing into the area of witness protection mr dowd such showboating puts lives at risk
i think you're a dangerous man mr dowd
i hope so mr reynard
no? then what did he say?
 eddie told you?
i'll take odds on cecil number two
so what'd this guy do? snitch off a dealer?
 every word
but they've still got laura gordon  and she was the closest about 20 feet from the killer
ilene are you crazy?
shouldn't one of us?
no  leave him be it's better for everyone
i'm roger baron i work with edward dowd
 what trial?
i knew jimmy chin the boy who was shot okay?
and you were at the trial to to see that justice was done?
that's right
 why don't you ask chuckie?
chuckie od'd mrs esparza he's dead
 roger 
i know what i'm doing go
you mustn't talk to art you mustn't tell art that i was at the trial do you hear me?
i would tend to plead the fifth
mr ortega what is "la compania"?
a cubano army basically inside and outside prisons
and its purpose?
fighting the aryan warriors and the black guerrillas basically
for control of the prison drug trade?
i would tend to plead the fifth
yeah we do some of that
what is your rank within la compania?
great mom
i'm a soldado in the gwing regiment
and what does a soldado  a soldier  do?
a soldado he runs messages and materiel between the regiments
"materiel"? what do you mean by that?
cigarettes candy bars  pcp crack
if a member of the aryan brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
a soldado he takes care of it
by "takes care of" you mean "kills"
that's right
soldado
you know your father enjoys his company
isn't it unusual for an asian to be accepted into a cuban prison gang?
shu's the only one i know of
and why was an exception made?
chinatown sounded pretty cold
you mean to say mr kim told you that he murdered jimmy chin?
mr stipe a young man named jimmy chin was shot to death eight years ago in chinatown do you remember talking to the police?
that guy they arrested  he was the wrong gguy
no they ggot the wrong guy i saw it the killer wasn't chinese
telephone  i suppose you don't know the phone company killed kennedy because he was trying to bbreak it up  and they'll never let that happen they control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end and 
the phone company was broken up
ilene we don't really know that
and you bbelieve that
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association the world is a hologram albert
yes it's a great big psychedelic circus ride isn't it cooper?
albert
you said "teresa banks" so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
yes either right now or right when i thought of it the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again because it is only a feeling i am powerless to stop it and another thing albert when the next murder happens you will help me solve it
let's test it for the record will the next victim be a man or a woman?
a woman
what color hair will she have?
blonde
quiet mother
tell me some other things about her
she's in high school she's sexually active she's on drugs she's crying out for some help
you're describing half the high school girls in america  what is she doing right now?
she is preparing a great abundance of food
i'm glad you let me talk to you you used to not let me talk to you
go away i am not talking to you
i want you
no god no
who are you? who are you really?
i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth
this has nothing to do with your fire
i hope those guys are all right
i want you to kill for me
no never you'll have to kill me
i want you to kill for me
i was right behind you but you're too dumb to turn around  if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down

well little fella we don't need any outside help here i don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods in fact when the state boys called me about a "j edgar" coming up i think i said "so what?"
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government
well hope she'll be very happy
you're lucky i am not wasting you
well little fella let me put it this way the operative word here would be "federal" with or without the semantics of all this i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks both while living and deceased
that's why we're here sheriff cable where's the body?
out back in our morgue
we've got our own clock we'll lock up
we're taking the body back to portland and there's not a thing you can do about it
maybe not a thing but maybe two things
teresa banks had a ring any idea what happened to it?
we got a phone here that's got a little ring
sam get the body and put it in the van  sheriff cable where were you the night teresa banks was murdered?
i think i screwed that one once

that's right that's the best coffee you're gonna get around here
let's see your bread
not a lot around here no got some clubs but not very many fellas with balls
that's alright i was having a bad dream i was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline
oh
maybe i just live here what do you think about that?
can i ask you where you were the night teresa banks was murdered?
you can tell j edgar that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin' witnesses
got a couple of cups of coffee at hap's from her that's it by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? i could ask you the same question
no you couldn't
i think i'll take off my badge as well
chet i am calling you from portland oregon
they'll be up there in a half hour
ok gordon
no it's oregon portland oregon it's regional bureau chief cole out in portland oregon i need you out here chet
ok gordon
oregon a young girl has been murdered seventeen years old named teresa banks
okay gordon
smell something fishy huh?
i've got a surprise for you chet something interesting that i would like to show you arrangements are being made and i will meet you at the portland airport
your surprise chet her name is lil
right gordon we'll be in touch
coop agent chet desmond has disappeared gone like the wind in deer meadow
okay nice to meet you both
cooper meet the long lost phillip jeffries you may have heard of him at the academy
what?
albert come back here he's gone call the front desk
teresa banks
albert?
albert why tylenol?
anything else?
did gordon show you a woman named lil?
i'm up to speed stanley
agent chet wouldn't tell me what the blue rose meant
what are you talking about asshole?
and neither will i
oh alright  you know i liked agent desmond he had his own mo
stanley i heard all about it
no one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this
tell me about the letter
take a look at this chet and i found it under teresa banks' ring fingernail
no sir we did not
someone else has it now
that would indicate that it's the future
the later events have never been kept a secret
but what if it does?  you might need my help
your whores never showed up
where am i? and how can i leave?
you are here and there is no place to go
where's hap?
he's dead  good and dead
sorry to hear it
he didn't suffer
i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks she worked nights for a month that's it
any friends?
no
they left an hour ago pink nuts
ever see her with someone else?
no
did she ever mention any friends?
no  ask irene over there
how come jack let's you work here?
jack and i are united in holy matrimony
say no more
she only worked here a month nice girl never seemed to get here on time though ask me she had a little problem with 
what happened to her?
there was only one job teresa took the job her friend took a hike never saw her again
screw you
did you ever see teresa take cocaine?
no
do you take cocaine irene?
no i do not i never took cocaine or any other drugs i don't take drugs
i've thought about that i think her death is what you would call a "freak accident"
thanks
what do you mean?
her left arm it was numb she said she couldn't use it said it had no feeling probably from the drugs she was taking  i just thought i ought to tell you
thanks
code if you work with gordon you learn that right away
what are you
code i've heard a lot about this
shorthand really?
we're heading into a difficult situation
how do you figure?
i'll explain it to you do you remember lil's dance?
what do you mean?
her face had a sour look that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities they are not going to be receptive to the fbi
not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison
so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime
right which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation let me ask you something stanley did you notice anything about the dress?
i've had it numb nuts how much money you got?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight
gordon said you were good the tailored dress is our code for drugs did you notice what was pinned to it?
a blue rose
very good but i can't tell you about that
what? that's just gordon's bad taste
why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
he talks loud and he loves his code
i see he does talk loud
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation
it must be a high priority situation
why?
that's what i heard
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this and no one had a machine like this
that's good
yes it is good  what do you think is in these other drawers?
i don't know sam
maybe later we could take a look
sure but let's finish up with this first
cole said she was 17
oh
agent desmond would you hold the finger for me there's something up there
because i'm pissed off now give me your cash
it is a piece of paper with the letter "t" imprinted on it take a look
we're not you and i are going to get some food
yes it's been several hours since we've eaten i didn't realize that so much time had past did you agent desmond?
it's late sam
it's not late it's early really early
i think that's a good idea
are you speaking to me in a code?
no sam i'm speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say
in that case we should go to the canyon trailer park
she must have known someone
hey i'm sorry you want girls i'll give you girls
i'll get my kit
she's wearing a ring
may i see the magnifying glass agent desmond?  there doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring
he's not the murderer  but he's a bozo
yes he is like a clown
i don't take it sam i give it
faulty wiring
esthetics are subjective aren't they agent desmond?  i'm sam stanley if you ever need me
thanks sam for the good work you have a good eye for detail
we do notice things don't we agent desmond? are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose?
that's more like it
you didn't do your homework?
noooo
okay this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week you remember the
don't tell me now tell me right before the test i won't be able to remember long enough
you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen
thanks
when?
the usual 9:15
he probably wanted to drive over
were you with bobby? or are you two still fighting?
gary you're quite an animal
no and yes i don't know what i'm going to do about bobby i know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me and he thinks i'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him
are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
i don't know what to do
you know what your problem is?  you're just too adorable
you know i think you're right i'm just too adorable
i'm just too adorable i'm just too adorable
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night? nighttime is my time
you're telling me but only because you never let me in on any of it you're not going to see bobby are you?
maybe
oh god laura
this is ridiculous  i'm not gonna be in your way  we can talk the case over
screw you
well why not?
because bobby is a loser you said so yourself he's a goon  james is the one  he loves you with that "lasting love" "true love"
sweet? god he's gorgeous
james is very sweet and very gorgeous
faster and faster for a long time you wouldn't feel anything then you would burst into fire forever
okay i suppose i should go home
call me
sure what do you want me to call you?
call me anything just don't call me late for dinner
donna are you my best friend?
isn't he incredible gets along with everybody

i just want a friend just one friend for just one minute
laura how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
yes that's what i want thanks d

that would be wonderful but it's only been a year since andrew died
what are you afraid of? what people think?
i don't want to offend the customs of your country
believe me josie you would not offend the customs of this country for instance i don't eat fish eyes
fish eyes?
even if it offended someone i wouldn't eat a fish eye
you're a pimp?
why wouldn't you eat a fish eye harry?
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing and he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling splat it just stuck up there and spread out it was about the size of a half dollar and that's why i don't ever eat fish eyes
i understand
we throw away the whole head
sure honey what's the hurry?
i forgot my books at school
what?
what were you doing in my room?

nothing
how good's your intelligence?
very good
and so what is the rest of his case aside from dr thompson?
as far as we know nothing
not one minute longer or milt will come for you
accused not indicted he resigned the firm divorced nineteen seventy galvin worked with michael morrissey until morrissey retired in 'seventy eight since then he's been on his own four cases before the circuit court he lost them all he drinks
four cases in three years
the man's an ambulance chaser
tell me about this case
this is a nuisance suit he's looking for small change he's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court
no  we don't want this case in court
neither does he that's where he loses this man's scared to death to go to court we only have to call his bluff
i want to settle this thing and be done with it i don't want the archdiocese exposed
no absolutely and we're going to see that it is not
so what i want to do is stop it here i'm going to make him an offer i want to do it myself i want it to come from me
milt?
all right but let's keep the price down i've called ed concannon he recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial
well of course it's always dangerous
i know that answer if we went to trial would we win?
yes
how did you settle on the amount?
we thought it was just
you thought it was just
yes
because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount two hundred ten thousand that would mean i keep seventy
that was our insurance company's recommendation
just in love with everybody it's really a beautiful planet i love you rick i love you guys i love everybody
yes it would be
and no one will know the truth
what is the truth?
that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life she's in a coma her life is gone she has no family she has no home she's tied to a machine she has no friends  and the people who should care for her: her doctors and you and me have been bought off to look the other way we have been paid to look the other way i came in here to take your money  i brought snapshots to show you so i could get your money  i can't take it if i take it if i take that money i'm lost i'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser  i can't do it i can't take it
mickey told me to come back to work
yes get her on the phone
that was a dr david gruber's office
gruber
mickey told him to call  'he's some very hotshot surgeon at mass commonwealth he wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of deborah ann kaye you meet him at the hospital'
it looks that way
larry you and your wife got problems?
you know what that would mean?
to get somebody from a boston hospital to say he'll testify?
a mrs doneghy called i told you that
frank galvin's who's calling please? bishop brophy's office
what does it mean?
they want to settle  it means a lot of money
does that mean i'm back for awhile?
it's a crime
yes  it is a crime a serious crime
i wouldn't do it
i don't want to talk about it i love you guys i love my friends
you would not?
no
in fact you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury you've just sworn to that isn't that right?
yes
just now
yes
sworn before god you would tell the truth?
yes
now i'd like to ask you something: four years ago when you were working as a nurse are you aware that drs towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed?
i
that's it
and wasn't that an oath? these are your initials here: kc when you signed this chart you took an oath no less important than that which you took today  isn't that right?  isn't that right?
i yes
then please which is correct? you've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? which is the lie when were you lying?
i
you know these doctors could have settled out of court they wanted a trial they wanted to clear their names
'they lied' indeed when did they lie? and do you know what a lie is?
i do yes
you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago
that's not my handwriting
you've just said you signed it
better than one
good
yes i yes i signed it yes but i i didn't write that figure
you didn't write that figure and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
because i kept a copy i have it right here
i thought i would need it
and why please tell us would you think that?
after after the operation when that poor girl she went in a coma dr towler called me in he told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired and he never looked at the admittance form  and he told me to change the form he told me to change the one to a nine  or else or else he said  he said he'd fire me he said i'd never work again who were these men? who were these men? i wanted to be a nurse
that is correct i was engaged to render an opinion
engaged to render an opinion for a price is that correct? you're being paid to be here today?
just as you are sir
are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor?
naw two on a quaalude bad luck
no i am not it's quite common in new york state
i'm sure it is but this is massachusetts doctor certified in internal medicine?
no
neurology?
no
orthopedics?
i'm just an md
do you know dr robert towler?
i know of him
how is that?
right
through through his book
what book is that?
meth methodology and technique
of anesthesiology?
'methodology and techniques of anesthesiology' yes
how old are you?
i am seventyfour years old
uhhuh still practice a lot of medicine?
i'm on the staff of
yes we've heard that doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? isn't that right? you you're available for that? when you're paid to be there?
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while
sir yes when a thing is wrong as in this case i am available i am seventyfour years old i am not boardcertified
i have been practicing medicine for fortysix years and i know when an injustice has been done
do you indeed i'll bet you do fine fine we'll save the court the time we will admit the doctor as an 'expert witness' fine
objection
frank galvin we've met before
to get her heartbeat back?
we've touched on this his own witness has said
almost nine minutes causing brain damage
your honor your honor
and you would come here and on a slip of memory four years ago you'd ruin their lives
she hates me it's over you'll see as soon as you get married everything changes you sure you want to go through with it man?
huh
my doctors didn't want a settlement at any price they wanted this cleared up in court they want their vindication i agree with them but for today the offer stands before we begin the publicity of a trial for today only  when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn  as long as you understand that  it's got to be that way
nothing further your honor
mr galvin rebuttal?
i'll rule on that presently  proceed
you may step down
one moment mr concannon
thank you your honor further: ms costello is a rebuttal witness as a 'surprise witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here
i'm going to uphold that
don't equivocate be positive just tell the truth
what do you mean it changes?
yes
say it
i was her doctor
you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy
i was one of a group of
answer affirmatively simply keep those answers to three words you weren't 'part of a group' you were her anesthesiologist isn't that right?
yes
you were there to help dr marx deliver her baby were you not?
yes
when she
c'mon larry be good for you
dr towler who was in the operating room with you?
ms nevins nurseanesthetist; dr marx of course
what did these people do when her heart stopped?
we went to code blue
'code blue' what does that mean?
it's a common medical expression it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat dr marx cut an airway in her trachea to get her oxygen her and the baby ms nevins
why wasn't she getting oxygen?
well many reasons actually
tell me one?
she'd aspirated vomitus into her mask
i just want to be alone
she threw up in her mask let's cut the bullshit say it: she threw up in her mask
that's right
and what did your team do
well we
you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear isn't that what you did?
yes
a patient riddled with complications questionable information on her on her admitting form
we did everything we could
to save her and to save the baby is that
yes
all right now there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator go to bed right after "falcon crest"
you reached down into death now isn't that right?
my god we tried to save her you can't know you can't know
tell us
that's all right
i was telling your wife we have a very good case here
i doubt we'll have to go to trial
we told them we didn't want it to come out this way
i completely understand
we just
it's completely done on a contingency basis that means whatever the settlement is i retain onethird that is of course the usual arrangement
no she hates me i want to end everything here now
hold on a second
i'm going to have you disbarred i'm going to have your ticket you know what you did? do you know what you did?
you ruined my life mister me and my wife and i am going to ruin yours  you don't have to go out there to see that girl we been going four years  four years my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they what what they did to her sister
i swear to you i wouldn't have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case
what you thought? what you thought i'm a workingman i'm trying to get my wife out of town we hired you we're paying you i got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred
i'm going to win this case mist mr doneghy i'm going to the jury with a solid case a famous doctor as an expert witness and i'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars
you guys you guys you're all the same the doctors at the hospital you it's 'what i'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'we did the best that we could i'm dreadfully sorry' and people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives
i understand  i went to the bar association they tell me you're going to be disbarred
it was good of you to meet
that's what i'd planned to
i'm on my way with eddie  ludwig's 63rd and madison  the suspects might be there already
yeah i guess so
i'm going to take you to the home to see the girl
from what i've seen mr galvin you have a very good case
yes yes i think so i hope you'll be comfortable i'm putting you up at my
i made a reservation at
apartment  no no please you don't know who we're dealing with i please believe me they
what difference would
these people play very rough they don't want to lose this case there's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear i
there's nothing they can do to me
in your opinion what happened to deborah ann kaye?
cardiac arrest during delivery her heart stopped when the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen you get brain damage that is why she's in the state she's in today
really?
now dr towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes in your opinion is his estimate correct?
it's my opinion it took him much longer nine ten minutes there's too much brain damage
no you did fine
i'm afraid that's not true  will you want me to stay on till monday?
no no thank you doctor you go home
you know sometimes people can surprise you sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth
yes i yes
no no thank you you go home
well
then you're saying there's no negligence based on my question?
yeah i see you're right c'mon let's party
i given the limits of your question that's correct
the doctors were not negligent
i um
why is that?
her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance she
that's what the sister said the chart said she ate nine hours prior to
she went in complaining of stomach cramps good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart
is that what a good doctor would do? how old are you please?
i am seventyfour years old
what qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
i'm trying to slash my wrists
i am on the staff of
easthampton hospital for women excuse me what is that a joke? let me tell you something doctor those men at catherine laboure men who are known not only in this city but the world were trying to save a woman's life they were there and here you are four years later read some hospital report and say
i made a detailed physical examination of the patient sir yesterday evening i
actually yes it's by no means bad i
then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? you know what code blue means?
'code blue'
it's a common medical term
yes i wrote it
i yes it is
and you wrote that
you're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
yes
page 414 'if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask' is that what happened to deborah ann kaye? she aspirated into her mask?
she threw up in her mask yes but she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission
if she had eaten say one hour prior to admission the inducement of a general anesthetic the type you gave her would have been negligent?
negligent yes it would have been criminal but that was not the case
thank you
yes? galvin right?
that's perfectly all right i'm kind of rushed do you mind if we walk while we talk?
deborah ann kaye
deborah ann kaye
i couldn't find any razor blades
right who called?
the archdiocese called they want to settle her estate
and you're going to do that?
yes
you're going to settle out of court?
why?
her doctors killed her
i'm sorry?
her doctors murdered her they gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life  her doctors murdered her
do you know who her doctors were?
well this is terrific now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable just go out there forget about everything and laugh it up
i read the file yeah marx and towler i know who they were
the most respected
whose side are you arguing? i thought that you wanted to do something i don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate'  no offense but we all know where the money's going to i have an interest in the hospital; and i don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me they gave her the wrong anesthetic they turned the girl into a vegetable they killed her and they killed her kid you caught 'em now: how many others did they kill?
what are they going to do? not invite me to their birthday party?  look i gotta go i have to be in cambridge
i understand
the case with anyone and i'll meet you tuesday and we'll go over your testimony
that's perfectly all right
uh why why are you doing this?
to do right isn't that why you're doing it?
hi how are you doing?
ha ha ha
you live in the neighborhood?
uhhuh my nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months so i stopped by
how old is he?
four you're great with these kids
you're really  you are you the one they told me was the nurse?
who told you that?
mrs
mrs simmonds
yes
i used to be a nurse
no have fun first then laugh now forget about marriage for a while go party
that's a wonderful profession my daughterinlaw's a nurse what did you do stop?
yes
you were the admitting nurse at st catherine laboure hospital on may twelfth nineteen seventysix the night deborah ann kaye was admitted
yes
these are your initials 'kc'?
kathy costello that's my maiden name
yes
what did she say?
she said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital
one hour
it's bullwinkle
yes
and did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record standing for one hour?
i did
a single hour
yes
why is that?
i was held up
this is a complicated case your honor
i'm sure it is frank: and let me tell you something if we find it so complex how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  see my point? let's talk a minute frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
my client can't walk your honor
he was like a total babe
i'm on duty
it's really not all your fault i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems personal things you know made some bad investments at least now he's peaceful
i know full well she can't frank you see the padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket you follow me? i'm trying to help you
things change
that's true sometimes they change sometimes they don't now i remember back to when you were disbarred
i wasn't disbarred they dropped the pro
and it seems to me a fella's trying to come back he'd take this settlement and get a record for himself  i myself would take it and run like a thief
i'm sure you would
thank you for seeing me
that's perfectly all right
you should have taken their offer especially if you were unprepared
i had a witness disappear on me
this is the park view hotel i'm the hotel manager are you looking for someone?
that happens
i could subpoena him if i had a week
i don't have a week this case never should have come to trial you know better you're mr independent you want to be independent? be independent now i've got no sympathy for you
ready your honor
defense?
thank you your honor i'll continue dr thompson did you examine deborah ann kaye last night at the northern chronic care facility?
what?
i believe that's the law is it not mr galvin?
if i may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way
i'd just like to get to the point mr galvin let's not waste these people's time answer the question mr witness please would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
yes you we're looking for our room 1002
i'm an attorney on trial before the bar representing my client my client do you understand? you open your mouth and you're losing my case for me
listen to me fella
no no you listen to me all i wanted in this case is an even shake you rushed me into court in five days my star witness disappears i can't get a continuance and i don't give a damn i'm going up there and i'm going to try it let the jury decide they told me sweeney he's a hard ass he's a defendant's judge i don't care i said the hell with it the hell with it i'll take my chances he'll be fair
and don't give me this shit 'i was a lawyer too' 'cause i know who you were you couldn't hack it as a lawyer you were bag man for the boys and you still are i know who you are
are you done?
damn right i'm done i'm going to ask for a mistrial and i'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case i'm going to take a transcript to the state and ask that they impeach your ass
you aren't going to get a mistrial boy we're going back this afternoon we're going to try this case to an end now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail
mr concannon?
overruled
exception
what do you know they moved it catch you later
noted thank you  miss costello was a rebuttal witness her sole rebuttal was the document which has been disallowed

i understand
but dick he's looking for two years in tucson and they called him up and said to come out he's a good man he's only trying to do what's right
and i have inquiries out to doctors experts in the field there is of course a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent

hello this is mr dorchester in records we're looking for kathy costello
i need a cigarette  she left my office four years ago we're looking for a chart  i need a cigarette
klupner  mrs klupner
we got to talk
come on we'll get a cup of coffee
i don't know
i don't want a mistrial
i what are you talking about? i talked to her this morning and she said
she told me
she did?
i just saw her
in new york?
what?
mrs?
you saw kat in new york  or is she in town? is she in town?
yes
you have a record of what happened in the operating room
yes that's correct
there are notations every thirty seconds
yes
of the procedures
yes the roving nurse
but those notations stop  fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kaye's
we we were rather busy
i'm separated
fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped  and they resume seven minutes
as i've said we had some more
they start again three minutes earlier
we had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes  we were trying to restore her
what happened in those three
we were trying to restore her heartbeat
what happened in those three minutes?
we'd gone to 'code blue' we were administering electro
why did it take that long to get her heartbeat
wait wait wait you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes?
then there is a god why don't we take that baby picture
yes
huh and why is that?
because she was anemic  it's right there on her chart her brain was getting less oxygen anyway
how'm i doing so far?
so far you're great you got a cigarette?
should i?
a huge law firm okay? they put him in the firm he's married everything's superb franky he's starting to talk like he comes from dorsetshire some fuckin' place 'you must drop by with pat and me' okay?
yes
and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for stearns harrington and he bought a dog and everything is rosy  then mr stearns he tried to fix a case
the big boy did?
hey  i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid  i dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze' at the bad guy what'd you dream about?
of course
that frank was working on yeah he thought franky needed some help so they bribed a juror so franky finds out he comes to me in tears he thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint i told him 'franky wake up these people are sharks what do you think they got so rich from? doing good?' he can't be comforted he tells the boys at stearns and harrington they've disappointed him he's going to the judge to rat them out
huh
before he can get there here comes this federal marshal and franky's indicted for jury tampering they throw him in jail he's gonna be disbarred his life is over  jimmy gimme another drink  how are you?
me too
okay now so he's in jail he finally he gets to see the light he calls up harrington he says he thinks he made a mistake as if by magic charges against him are dropped he's released from jail  ps he's fired from the firm his wife divorces him he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years  you like that story?
that won't start no more fires  we might's well go home
yeah  no sense stayin' out here
let's go
wait a minute  wait a minute bombs don't unscrew
it's no meteor that's for sure
she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30 o'neill let's pick up the guys for a drink i have major news to announce
darnedest thing i ever saw  the way that's unscrewing
we'd be in all the papers
hey how about that
we could show 'em we're friendly huh?  walk out there with a white flag  here  i got an old sugar sack in my car
come on out  we're friends
madrid has just blacked out nothing more coming through
the same thing that happened on our pacific coast  anything from them yet?
all right  i've seen enough
then our first target will be the initial landing place outside los angeles
i'll request the scientists from pacifictech to monitor the drop  we'll clear the area all around  after that we'll hit them all over the world i'll have longrange bombers alerted loaded and standing by
knowing larry he probably missed the flight
i'm looking for some pacifictech professors
there's nobody left around here now
we had a chancewe could have stopped them  the mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up  the fools  they cut their own throats
there was a girl with themif i could find her
but i think i know where she'll be
yesugly looking isn't it
yesi was fishing up in the hills
you must have caught plenty with all that tackle
oh  there were three of us  the others flew back in my plane  i don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater
it hit sideways and skidded in
nothing let's get crazy
he's top man in astro and nuclear physics  he knows all about meteors
well i did a thesis on modern scien tists  working for my masters degree
did it do you any good?
why sure  i got it  do you have a match?
i'm sorry  i don't smoke
forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines  they had him on the cover of 'time'  you've got to rate to get that
aw he isn't that good
how can you say that when you don't know him
what's he like?
likeah
olivier's in that right?
i didn't know how to stop you
i might have recognized you without the beard  and you didn't wear glasses on the 'time' cover
they're really for long distance when i want to look at something close  i take them off
there's only about one explanation for a thing like thisgot a pin?
automobile ignitions are insulated
didn't you have something to do with this?  i know you sent word to the sixth army command
i just told them the local situation colonel heffner's in full charge now
you never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance
would you like some coffee general?
can you handle one of these?
then it's on to the real thing
sureget in
no  the air's going to be full of jets in a minuteand there they are
i bought it for the square dance i thought i ought to wear some thing western
it's gone now
where are we?
southwest of corona somewhere there must have been another cylinder down here  they've been through this whole area and cleared everybody out  there's a farmhouse  let's see if we can find something to eat
don't you live at home?
no on the campus  i haven't any family
i come from a big one  nine of us all in minnesota except me
i have no close folks  my parents died when i was a kid
this isn't right
it doesmaybe that's why i feel kind of lost right now
we'll get safely out of here don't worry
but they seem to murder everything that moves
if they're mortal they must have mortal weaknesses  they'll be stopped  somehow
i feel like i did one time when i was small  awful scared and lonesomei'd wandered off  i've forgotten why  but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me  they found me in a church  i was afraid to go in any place else
i liked him
but you're not going to  you're not the kind  you're tired anyway  you've been up all night  you cracked up in a plane  slept in a ditch  but you want to know something?  it doesn't show on you at all
hours  i've been so scared
it was  one of them
what was it like?
hey i'm starved let's go get something to eat we'll bring back food for everybody
i couldn't see much in the dark  but it was one
we're right in a nest of 'em  i've got to get a look at them
they could be as curious about us as we are about them
maybe   maybe they want to take us alive
it's blocked here too  they've pushed up earth or something all around outside  here this way
yes with these suits  we've used them before on atomic tests odd looking aren't they?
very futuristic  yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut
i could wear it longer  but it's less trouble this way
my kid brother has one  you know why?
yes   fits better in a football helmet
i'm not really hungry
how'd you guess?
that's the kind of a kid brother you'd have
i wonder if they're going through this too?
you'll be all right with us  for as long as anybody's got
don't let's lose each other
how could it happen to everybody's watch together?
have you got a pocket compass?
it's pointing out to the gully  where that meteor came down
i think that  gizmo  is a machine from another planet
we better get word to the authorities and   look
c'mon i insist
it might give us something
it might give us time to search out some weakness in the martians
i believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood
if we get what transportation we can and pick up instruments and books from pacifictech
no  i thought you had them
all right  i'll get them   go ahead  go ahead  i'll catch up with you
right
looks like the fishing was good
are they sure it's a meteor?  it didn't come down like one
that's right  came down in kinda spurts didn't it?  you fellers'll have to figure it out  you're scientists  all i know  they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot
i wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid
my gift to you
i'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning
so is the town i notice
i warned you civil defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate
i just came to tell you  everyone has been alerted
it's always been a good persuader
couldn't you try to communicate with them first  and shoot later if you have to?
i'm here to make up a report not to interfere with the operations you've set up  you're still in command  clayton forrester  i haven't seen you since oak ridge
not all  radio is out  but our field phones are okay so far
and they'll go out the minute there's another ray  a cylinder reported down by huntington beach  that's a job for the navy
from the data  and from that picture the air force took earlier tonight    what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship  one lands  others follow later  they appear to clear an area then drop in groups of threes joined magnetically  is that possible?
under the table
that's because we want a chance to observe them  this is the only place we've had time to surround them with sufficient force to contain them  what happens here will be a guide to all other operations the minute action begins and a pattern of defense develops i'll get my report to washington  you've deployed your forces well
thank you sir  if they start anything we can blast them right off the earth
they'll probably move at dawn
it was nearer than that
welllhow do you do dr forrester
there's a square dance at the social hall this evening
but they're not human  dr forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization 
if they're more advanced than us they should be nearer the creator for that reason
i've done about all i can do here you go back in  sylvia  i like that doctor forrester  he's a good man
do to number threecome in
the best table in the house
we're getting this under control won't need any more help  over
okay  send the tanker in but you stand by until that thing cools off over
i think somebody ought to check on it over
well there's some fellows fishing at pine summit might be interested  they probably saw it come down  i'll let 'em knowwhat's it look like?
we sell the tamales enchiladas  hot dogs
who?  where d'you think they come from
how would i know
everything human don't have to look like you and me
welcome to california
sure sure  everybody understands you wave the white flag you wanna be friends
so long father
we did  bad mistake  the fans are clamoring for more so evil never dies right?  anyway a while back we got a call from wes  he's got this idea  and who better to resurrect freddy than his creator?
i thought he'd stopped doing horror
believe it or not he told me i hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare  they're his inspiration  but now he's got a new script in the works
he's very excited about it
the nightmares
he's excited about the script  you should be too  it stars you
can i read it?
he's not showing it until it's down  but it sounds hot and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is  you and robert got great ratings today which is the first thing we needed to know
you mean that was a
sort of a trial balloon
i don't know maybe it's because i love debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad i'm not sure
so?
so i don't know about horror
come on  kids love horror
and ii've got other things happening
i'm sure we can match any offer
what?
i know  we asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked  look how about we get in touch your agent  you still with jerry?
yes but
we'll work something out  i'm sure you'll be happy with it
i don't know  a couple months  why?
about what?
and since you've been thinking of making it  has anything funny happened?
i don't follow
like weird calls by any chance?
chase
no biggie really
i'm sorry  at least we're in on piece

more or less  dylan time to get dressed  i'm late
five earthquakes in three weeks is enough

this is your bachelor party you haven't had sex with anyone yet
you've got to get back on the horse some time  look you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls  i know how scary that feels
no you don't
okay but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with
maybe you should tell me your dream
you probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass  dreams work like that  you want me not to go on this job?
just be careful okay?

then i guess we're doin' this the right way aren't we?  if we pull up to a burning building i'll gladly let you go first
right in there pal
you don't understand  if dylan falls asleepthen
he doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet
what?
he sleepwalks you idiot  he's fully capable of walking out of this hospital  oh my godhe thinks i've gone home
you have a fever sweetie?
just for a few hours  julie'll be with you
what?
bye
rex?  who's rex?
finish please
if i'm not out in a half hour send for the paramedics
this is going to give you nightmares
i like this story
say how they find their way back home
no  tonight  it's important
they were safe and could sleep
the mean old man with the claws
don't let the bedbugs bite
he can follow the breadcrumbs right?
right
rex woke me up he was fighting
that's the old rick
not sleepy
you've got to sleep dylan you
your bed?
under my covers  kids singing and way down there the manthe mean man
trying to get uptrying to get into our world
no i don't think so  you just have topray or reach
i honestly don't know try to sleep baby
can you come with me in my dreams?
home that's right
can we go get rex now?  the bad man's getting awful close
put it to you this way  you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula mister
i know he is sweetie  we'll both go get rex right now
right 'cross the freeway
that's right  so i won't be long meanwhile julie's gonna be right here with you
promise  cross my heart  but until mommy gets back dylan whatever you do don't fall asleep
coming for you
here
a story?
read me some?
i'm fine
everything went great i thought  we really got you didn't we?
i'm proud of you lad
i don't know why you didn't tell me that's all
just because it's a love story doesn't mean it can't have a decapitation or two
holding my own  you know that guy who was calling me all the time?  he's started again  he's been putting stuff in my mail
must've read about the funeral  sick mother  that's the last thing you need right now i'm sure
it's actually been giving me freddy nightmares
yeahhow'd you know?
call it a guess
wes won't show it until it's finished that's what he told me at least  i asked him at the funeral
when do you think it'll be done?
the way he's writing is so weird who knows?  i asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral and what was it he said?  oh yeah as far as dylan trying to reach god  weird huh that he'd have your kid in it?
i don't know
quake knocked you off your feet  you got bumped pretty good actually 
when it is denial  i don't think that's the case here but if you're really worried have a doctor check him out you'll see everything's fine
thinking i saw freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy  and jumping in
you didn't jump in
that's my memory  and it seemed absolutely real
seemed not was
it's in my family you know  my grandmother died in an institution
really?  hell if having a screwy family made you crazy the world'd be one colossal nuthouse
kids know when something's bugging a parent  you've got no idea who this is calling?
steady
what's this?
six weeks of this and you're surprised you've got freddy in your dreams?  hell sonny bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere  even at mass
really?
absolutely  and how many times has letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  it gets under your skin if you let it
you really think dylan's okay?
john  it's heather  i need help
you got it  what's happening?
dylan's run away from the hospital  i don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house  but i think freddy's after him  i know it sounds crazy
you're right  that sounds crazy
john  will you please just look for him around the hospital?  i'm gonna go right to the house  will you help me john?  please
where's dylan?  have you seen him?
got me
what are you talking about?
fred krueger did it
yeah sure
yes?
is chase porter your husband?
yes
i'm afraid there was an accident  it appears he fell asleep while driving ma'am
no you don't ma'am it's not necessary
i want to see for myself
hi  this is heather langenkamp
still drawing a blank
the car's no there yet?
no  ilisten i can't make it in today
you're kidding right?
listen dammit
i just can't
big truck went right by before you opened the door  life on the fault line
dunno  just have this feeling today
thanks  just give them the time he called  they're keeping a list supposedly  sorry  my nerves are so raw these days
's okay
sure  we'll do an operation doctor dylan and doctor julie we'll fix him good as new
very
they wouldn't let me
what's that?
killing innocence one way or the other
i think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress
it can be captured sometimes
captured?  how?
by storytellers of all things  every so often they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence  then it's held prisoner for a while  in the story
exactly  the problem comes when the story dies it happens a lot of different ways the story gets too familiar or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned  however it happens when the story dies the evil is set free
current version  for ten years he's been imprisoned as freddy by the story of nightmare on elm street  but now that the films have stopped  the genie's out of the bottle heather that's what the nightmares are about that's what i'm writing
that's not what the dreams say he's doing
she just saw two of her friends killed they probably threatened her
c'mon get the hookers in a circle we better put cochise out of business
then what is he doing?
well see he's gotten used to being freddy now  and kinda likes it here in our time and space too  sohe's trying to cross over from film into our reality
interestingly enough in the dreams there is one person  a gatekeeper so to speak  someone freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world  it's you heather
me?  why me?
dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense  you played nancy after all the first to humiliate and defeat him
that was nancy not me
but it was you that gave nancy her strength  so to get out he has to come through you  and it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points
heather it's just a movie a dream really
you know damn well it's more than that now  how can we stop him?
choice?  what kind of choice?
take care
whether or not you're willing to play nancy one last time
now that you have a child is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
no not really  i
do you let your child watch your movies?
my child?  nobut
and how about your costar in nightmare i  would you trust him alone with your child?
robert?  i
maybe we should ask him hmmm?  we've got a surprised heather  a great big surprise for you and our audience
heather this is sara risher over at new line  how are you?
oh hi  i'm fine sara  my god a voice from the past
who's your friend?
really  listen heather i won't take but a minute of your time  it's just that we have something to propose to you and wonder if you'd stop by the offices bob'd love to talk to you
uhsurewhen?
no time like the present  the car will bring you
now?
just take a minute  you'll be glad you did i bet
coffee'd be nice
sounds good  kim would you get heather and me a coffee?  how you like it hon?
black's fine
me too
not yet
and here's mike's partner in more ways than one a gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates the very lovely miss desiree
it's time these boys saw some real blue water
yep
your father?
all his years at sea he never stopped talking about these islands
you miss him
he knows
you sound so sure
i am about this
he never would have believed a woman like you existed
guilty
what can i do? i'm dead debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing
on the deck of the yankee the night you asked me to marry you  we weren't much older than they are
i can take it
they've become what you wanted they're a crew  that's why he came
we were idealists
because we believed we could make an impact out here  self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing
i haven't forgotten
phil he's not looking inside  he's just striking out at the world
he has a lot of hurt inside him
well he better learn to own it actions have consequences  it's not what happens here alice it's what they take away with them
claiming their place in the world
i'll stop him you stall him
hey  weigh  blow the man down
a pretty young maiden she happened my way
give me some time to blow the man down
weight  hey  blow the man down
she said "none the better you all go to hell"
give me some time to blow the man down
yes sir
good  let's go sailing
mr lawford stand by to ease the mainsheet  rick get on the jib sheet  george john philip tim and dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse  george will show you what to do  tod show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines forecourse first work upward
watch the telltales chuck  if we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water
i'm saved let's party
i didn't know sir
it's your job to know  if something goes wrong up there the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not
skipper uh the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side
well that's all part of it
we've got weather moving in from the west
everybody down  on the double
yes sir
north northeast  and dick please make a note of our final position
skipper called us out of the rigging
but your instinct was to lose sail?
who?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted
how old are you son?
fifteen
thank you
butler what'd i ever do to you?
you came back tod  you came back
it was an act of god for christ's sake
what do you mean?
it's me don't you see  terry's right i'm the escape hatch  i disobeyed order
yes sir
debbie
i couldn't bring her down here until i knew you were safe
yeah sure
okay
all right  i'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes
no i can't
yeah
rick march  who the hell are you?
gieg chuck
look meet us out front when you're through  if they try to take anything away from you like johnny quest up there just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat
whatever
my debbie?
well romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit
what do you mean?
i mean she looks pretty damn good in her alltogether for being thirty
that's what they get for not locking the door
so i'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop  no breathing or snoring suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped really fast like people are holding their breath
my old man split along time ago  it doesn't mean anything  you just take care of number one that's all that matters
to take a piss
if you're gonna cheat you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right
you've gotta be kidding  get the fuck outta my way
what?
is that all there is?
what's with her costume?
you're not a moron
wanna bet?  takes me half a day to get through one chapter of lawford and i still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about  you know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because i can't spell  while everybody else is sleeping i'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary
listen you don't cheat and we'll make sure you get the grades  we'll start a private study group  nobody knows  you'll ace that test
believe what?
her name  bregitta  it's poetry
yeah  how'd you do
congratulations
what about you?
i know
you know?  then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?
you got it
i just can't believe it
this is your moment don't you see? the instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again  when you stand up and are counted
yes you could  you did  this is all you  nobody else
what?
that we're going back  i don't want it to end  i don't want to be what i was when i left
what was that?
anonymous
figured what out?
who i am outside of this boat what the hell i'm doing here
i'll tell you who you are  you're the glue  you're the thing that holds everybody around you together you're strong you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't  it's a gift
rick marriage will be good for you it's done wonders for me
me either
i feel like we can do anything
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve
it's no my fault i was born first besides nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation so ease up on the sad sack stuff
it's not a vacation it's private school
i thought this was your dream come true
that's not why he's sending me
why then
because it looks good
nobody says you have to be like me
true you're a lot handsomer now don't you have enough blood already?
he does
you don't give him enough credit chas
it was a bad dream
shut up phil
like this
what's the difference?
you only hurt yourself you know?
like you really care  like any of you give a shit what happens to me
i guess
well that's just typical isn't it?
you won't miss a thing about being single the wild parties the different girls every night running around like a maniac god i miss that
is it true phil?
i gotta go
you weren't there you don't know what happened
i know enough
well and it's pretty cool too ya know?  bein' here together an all
we all have problems
i'm pissin' fire man
they don't know that  we were the only one's on deck look there's nothing they can do to me right?  i'm a kid
but that's not the point
that is the point and skipper'll slip off the hook
stan you're depressing me hey i didn't know you were going to fill 'er up just take a couple of gallons okay?
no i didn't
it says she was originally schooner rigged but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine  i think square rigs look so much more romantic
me too
yes
passport?
look i just better go
i know you will
maybe it's an air raid
i can't watch this
fine
okay rick all finished i can't wait for that bachelor party i need the action
good
look i appreciate you know the concern and all but like he said i can take care of myself
i just brought you something to eat
forget it
i'm used to spending a lot of time alone  i guess that's what i thought it would be out here  but it's not is it?
i'm sorry i left you hanging up there
it doesn't matter  really  i'm just sorry you got chewed out
do what?
ya know "it"
that's like wondering if your mom and dad do it  who wants to know?
right give me the will to live let me go first
come on man what'd they look like?
my mother says in this really low but very awake kind of voice "what?"
i said "sorry wrong room" and walked away
how do you know?  they might
'cause they're getting a divorce  that's why they sent me here  my sister's at tabor  they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business
depths of hell ohio  how 'bout you?
kennet square pa  'mushroom capital of the world'
here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare all you have to do is say 123 wake up  you'll be out of it  you'll wake up
my dad
it works?
nah not yet look you're my older brother i need some advice here what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
swear to god  only good advice he ever gave me  now go back to sleep
who?
my brother  he fell out of the old beech tree  broke his neck  i was on a camp out  they started going at it throwin' things a real knock down  they didn't find him 'till the next morning  they didn't even know why he was up there
jesus you never told them?
i couldn't
i can't make it out?
what are you talking about
yes sir
gentleman when you hear an order sing out  i want to know that you've heard and understand  raise the mainsail
speak up boy
well the first month it's great the second month things calm down a little by the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month hopefully the football season starts
unfurl the squares
all stop on the engine
it was my fault  i slipped
face what?
would you um say it's a big storm?
sometimes it gets exciting out here
you can't run from the wind son you trim your sails face the music and let the chips fall  bill let's close her up dog tight
i'm here on behalf of the crew sir
the fact is we'd like you to give phil another chance
sir?
something back home?
thanks stan you've been a lot of help
close the door  sit down
he killed the dolphin
of what?
of a fight he can't win out here
it's his father sir  he's suffocating him  we've all seen it
they have every right chuck
they send us because they want us to change or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same
i don't know
you should tell him  that's something he can take with him
so is violating international law
great  i was wondering how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
but you invited is aboard
your cannons made a compelling argument
he left his passport in curacao it's being mailed to panama
that is unfortunate  we'll have to take him with us
i thought we'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails
twice
is that what you were trained to do?
no
then what do you think he was trying to do
let the blow drive the boat down wind  neutralize our canvas
i know sister but i have a very good excuse
no
oh on the contrary the albatross is considered a very good omen  it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on  it's very bad luck if you kill one  and dolphins too
i know
as you can see there's a lot to do
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind
this is a working ship  promptness is not a luxury it's a necessity as is the work to maintain her  had we been ready i can assure you we would have sailed
happily it all worked out this time  bill take philip below and help him find a bunk
it will be more than that i can promise you
take good care of my son
he's a big boy
there can be no excuse for tardiness
and of course we are
well you never can tell these days can you?
well we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony
i should be eating with the crew
humor me  eat it anyway
why are you here?
i can take care of myself
oh really?
look you put me on this boat in the first place  i didn't want to come but i did  why do you have to embarrass me  why can't you just leave me alone?
it has nothing to do with him
you're absolutely right i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant i'm just weak sister; i'm so weak
well what does it have to do with? us?
no  look it's me okay?  can't it just be about me?  for once?
it's okay  i'll be in in a minute  look what do you want?
you do?
yes  i do
yes sir
you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing  it's all my responsibility  so i'll tell you what george you stay off of my bridge and i'll stay out of your galley  we'll get along that way
you're officer of the watch george
i'm sorry skip  it's this damned book  lawford gave it to me
we're short one long boat too  come on
get going rick you're late enough as it is
what's that?
a padlock
spirits have a way of bringing that out
and being sixteen
they're in a hurry to grow up  they don't know about consequences or responsibility  that's being sixteen too  i promise you one thing
what's that?
they'll know about it in the morning
she's cuban
not a chance  remind them that according to the geneva convention firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war
will you shut up?  you sound like my fucking sister
right think it over
that's enough
how the hell are we gonna get outta here?
we'll think of something
oh praise the lord  relax everybody  everything is under control  the jug head's going to think of something
i can show you how to use a slide rule
why would you do that?
lemme go  lemme go
why'd you jump?
because i felt like it  what do you care?
i couldn't do it
i don't know
well as soon as you grow some balls let me know
come on he didn't mean anything
shut up donut
like you'd know what to do with one
trust me donut  i know
what?  come on
on the dog watch night after the storm i look down into the skylight above skipper's cabin and there she was peelin' down
i've seen 'em  i've seen 'em
i figured it out
okay donut  whatever you say
what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out
i don't have to listen to this
you will if you wanna eat  right george?
look save it for somebody else will ya  this ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me
you know what he is talking about here?
what is it the secret?
if it were only that simple my young friend  read on gentlemen read on
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem mr lawford
read on young john  read on college boards are coming
he didn't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly
it seems we're short on singers
maybe i did i don't remember
outer
barometer's dropping  the first blow'll come from the south  might get interesting
what's that?
terry left his passport in curacao we could hide him
no  bring him on deck with the others
nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you
what?
no phil  it's a mammal
it hurts too much to care
raw deal
i'd love to get you in an operating room just once
about yourself?
about anything
long enough
you've gotta be kidding?
but they don't speak english
there are some things that everybody does in the same language
fandango junior  i'm gonna do some limbo baby
no way phil  not like this
roger meris steps up it's a corker down the pipe
come on man  let's just talk about it
yeah who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular
son of a bitch
sir
the first thing is i don't like people talking when i'm talking so the two of you shut up
no
then keep your mouth shut
excellent  bill find mr weathers a position to suit his condition
i'm not staying out here
joy rapture
each one of you will be responsible for one student  i'll expect you to be courteous  you represent this school and your country  we'll sail in the morning
you already have  now go on  do it
be gentle
what?
up you go  right now
i'm sorry
sorry won't cut it
i don't know
i can't
you climb damn it or so help me i'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there
aaauuuhhh
i hate you you son of a bitch
no  hate the fear inside of you climb like a man mister  hate it hate it away  hate your way up one more rung  do it right now
no we'll hit the son of a bitch head on
he climbed when he was ready
were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall
yes i was
what makes you so sure it was one?
i can't be sure
you really felt that your crew were up for the conditions
we'd come twelve thousand miles together through every kind of seas imaginable
except a "white squall"  with all due respect captain sheldrake they're only boys
they are much more than that sir
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier
it's gonna flash stevie we gotta get behind it
for killing a dolphin
 and that you invited him to strike you?  to fight it out on the deck of your ship?
do you think this is funny?  some kind of joke?  you lost six people out there
i don't think one second of this is funny sir
isn't also true that his vessel went down off of nantucket?  lost everyone on board  in fair weather no less
i understand
may i ask you something?
it wasn't hard
i used to helm a school ship  a long time ago
the coast guard 'eagle'  she never lost a race while you were skipper
nah listen to it it's a pussy it'll just steam on us it won't flash go high in the ceiling
 absolutely not
the papers are going to eat you alive  even if you beat it you'll never get another commission  they want someone to be accountable
i am accountable
no  i didn't
i don't know that anything could have prevented what happened
then what are you trying to say then?
don't mind him chucky  you're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline
screw you valentino  i haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody
what's that supposed to mean?
everybody knows why she went over tod  you jibed the boat
tim fill out the alarm card  clean the pipe poles wipe down the ladders and hang some hose
i was trying to get her up wind that's what you do when you're hit abeam  or maybe you're too stupid to know that
that's not what skipper thought  he was trying to spill air from the main
artie? that you artie?
yes ma'am what's on your almost perfect mind this evening?
how ya feelin' artie? i heard you wasn't doin' too well recent
i'm fine thank you i had a cardiac infarction but i'm on a new diet and exercising regularly i've never felt better

was in all the papers three years ago i'm seventysix was only seventy three then had a business in buffalo new york called rats with wings killed pigeons for anyone who wanted 'em killed
woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle she called the police and they came over and arrested me thought i was a sniper boys at the vfw loved that one cops didn't understand about the pigeons the damage they do to personal property i used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger i was gonna put out poison but i was afraid somebody's cat would eat it hell i had six cats myself so i used the 22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap
what happened on the charges?
guilty on a reduced charge hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place you seen it plain filth
sailor lula loves you
but i'm a robber and a manslaughterer and i haven't had any parental guidance
stevie i
she's forgiven you of all these things you love her don't be afraid sailor
but i'm wild at heart
if you are truly wild at heart you'll fight for your dreams don't turn away from love sailor don't turn away from love don't turn away from love
don't fuck with me man you look like a clown in that stupid jacket
this is a snakeskin jacket and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom
asshole
come here
i'm sorry
johnnie please nope charlotte north carolina here on business
yes that's so but there is not much to destroy
yeah
my lt might have something to say about that
in many capacities
he is my sponsor the general is the head of the secret police of honduras
certainly not we are here only briefly in fact until this evening when we fly to austin texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the cia
i couldn't say which one?
why not? how was the fishin'?
i think they are too serious these american fishermen in honduras we are not so concerned with the method
this island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place
it has its moments of uncertainty
hasta siempre
do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in scotland?
ah everybody screws up some brian you're working for the toughest lt on the job saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building it's just bad luck you're family
how's that?
the real joke is we never went fishing but we're still fishing
oh god oh god santos oh god marietta are you in on this? oh god
he served his time for what he did another thing if lula went with him of her own volition  willingly that is  there ain't much can be done about it
don't talk down to me johnnie farragut i know what volition means and that's why i want sailor ripley off the planet he's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead you'd only be defendin' yourself and with his record nobody'd fuss
now marietta i am goin' to help you and don't be gettin' carried away you don't want to be bringin' santos and his people into it
you're just jealous of santos cause he's sweet on me
darlin' you ain't seein' santos again are ya?
oh johnnie farragut don't you trust your very own marietta?
sorry sweetheart bein' in love with you like i am brings out that ugly jealous side
john when you're in there in the fire do you ever see
well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that lula back here and away from that murderer
sailor ain't a murderer you got to get off that kick and far's i can tell sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' lula even there he was protectin' her you oughta be thankin' him for that that bob ray lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em why am i tellin' you this you was around that night you ought to know just exactly what happened sailor just got a little too forceful is all you remember that night
marietta settle down now darlin' i want what's best for her too  like i said i'll do what i can to bring her home
this is the kinda mistake can take a hindu's lifetime to unfix you better get a move on johnnie before that boy got her holdin' down a memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms
i'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find lula then i'm comin' to get her you call soon's you got somethin' even if it's three in the am
i will marietta goodbye now
listen johnnie lula just called me she knew you were in no so they left the city
did she tell you where she was callin' from?
no but my guess is they're headed west so prob'ly texas their money must be runnin' low i don't think sailor had much to begin with if any and lula took the six hundred she had saved in the cherokee thrift
how'd she sound? was she doin' okay?
he's alive
could she be doin' okay johnnie? she's tryin' to prove somethin' to me that's all lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off defyin' me  johnnie i've done somethin' bad
what?
i won't tell you over the phone i'm comin' to no and i'll tell you then
marietta i was just gonna leave and see if i could pick up their trail
no you wait right there for me i'll be on the piedmont flight tomorrow at seven meet me at the airport
i'll meet you marietta if that's what you want but i'm against it

i'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
just some guys i met here i keep seein' 'em  now tell me
somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night and you wanted to tell me and i figured you wanted to tell me so's i could help
that was an accident jesus christ why did you have to go in there so fucking early? why didn't you listen to me
i did honey but that was last night let's just find those two kids before it's too late
honey i have to ask you this is santos involved in any of this?
hell no baby i wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you
that bastard pucinski
who? uncle pooch?
yeah the one that introduced santos to you and clyde
johnnie that's the past we gotta get on to our future sugar
all i have to do is grab my suitcase and i'm ready you're lucky cause i happen to love night drivin'
let's head for texas and see if we can pick up the trail
did i tell ya it's great to see ya again?
just come down john just 
this 'bout the fifth time?
and to think what coulda happened in that kingsized bed tonight
you won't of missed much
see ya downstairs
how'll he know what we look like? he seen our photo?
what i made you do mama?
you ain't actin' mama
why pace roscoe ripley ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
like you sweetheart you and your daddy got the same mouth eyes ears and nose only difference is your color hair is like mine
my daddy ain't never killed nobody has he mama?
 shut up your dad would fucking puke if he saw how you've shit on his department
course he ain't never killed nobody why'd you say that pace?
heard grandpa santos and grandmama talkin'
and?
grandmama said how sailor murdered a man
wrong baby your daddy never committed no murder musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper he made some mistakes is all your daddy ain't always been so lucky we're almost at the depot honey sit back a minute
thinkin' a second baby
why honey?
case daddy don't like me what if he don't like that i don't got his color hair
pace your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all
peanut
 you know what swayzak would do to the department if this got out? 
'bout fifty thousand times i got us a room at the cape fear and guess what? i hear powermad's at "the hurricane"
stab it and steer
i really did miss your mind while i was out at pee dee honey the rest of you too of course but the way your head works is god's own private mystery what was it you was thinkin'?
well i was thinkin' about smokin' actually my mama smokes marlboros now used to be she smoked kools? i stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade when i got old enough to buy my own i bought those now i've just about settled on mores as you probably noticed? they're longer
i guess i started smokin' when i was about six my mama was already dead from lung cancer
what brand'd she smoke?
camels same as me guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness
gee sailor i'm sorry honey i never would have guessed it
it's okay i hardly used to see them anyway i didn't have much parental guiding the public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin' he was a good ol' boy stood by me even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time
i'd stand by you sailor through anything
 stephen this is bullshit 
hell peanut you stuck with me after i planted bob ray lemon a man can't ask for more than that
you remind me of my daddy you know? mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies he had a long nose too like theirs did i ever tell you how he died?
in a fire as i recall
started he couldn't remember things? got real violent? mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask but i don't know seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces
grandmama pace had a long smooth white neck it was like on a statue it was so white?
but honey i thought you told me your uncle pooch raped you when you was thirteen
that's true uncle pooch wasn't really an uncle he was a business partner of my daddy's? and my mama never knew nothin' about me and him  that's for damn sure his real name was somethin' kind of european like pucinski but everyone just called him pooch he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away i always figured he was sweet on mama so when he cornered me one afternoon i was surprised more'n a little
how'd it happen peanut? he just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
i can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them mores in your mouth
sorry sugar go on and tell me how old pooch done the deed
 what he would do to your dad's department? you gotta let me finish it 
well mama was at the busy bee havin' her hair dyed? and i was alone in the house
didn't he say somethin'?
no he picked me up
'we' did it? whattaya mean? didn't he force you?
well sure but he was supergentle you know? i mean he raped me and all but i guess there's all different kinds of rapes i didn't exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didn't seem all that terrible it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich
and you never told nobody about it?
just you uncle pooch never acted strange or different after and he never did anything else to me i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry?
one hundred twenty decibels  head on collision of a '54 ford pickup and a '64 chevy station wagon no survivors balls of flame and grinding metal
uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in myrtle beach they still got way too much traffic there for my taste and another thing baby that government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space
here she goes again
what would your girlfriend think of that?
who asked you?
sailor that ozone layer is disappearin' seems to me the government could do somethin' about it one of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an xray
that woman's laugh creeps me out i heard somethin' like that somewhere before sound'd like the wicked witch
just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me you ready to dance?
i'm always ready to dance but i need me a kiss first honey just one?
that's good now go get yourself a beer  you fellas have alotta the same power elvis had y'all know this one?
that so?  you want to tell me what if any real thoughts you had lately?
what you have to get personal about so quick? all i mean is you could possibly read a book
we didn't have no tv up at pee dee baby you know?
twentythree months eighteen days is all don't need to make more'n it was  this couple's goin' on a date to hawaii the girl chose him over the other two guys
don't the reject guys get anythin'?
if you do it like that it'll open in the fire then you'll get burned and die
gift certificates to kentucky fried chicken
that don't seem fair
hell why should the datin' game be different from real life? at least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat
yeah?
wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
you think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes peanut ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
oh you know exactly what i mean honey? it'd make the future so simple and nice
at pee dee all you think about is the future you know? gettin' out? and what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again
i just think about things as they come up i never been much of a planner
it ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes lula i done a few things in my life i ain't too proud of but i'll tell ya from now on i ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason all i know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there
i want to thank you for coming to my graduation stephen it was a great inspiration to me
she got me an abortion
you tell the boy who knocked you up?
it was my cousin dell done it? his folks used to visit with us summers
what happened to him?
oh nothin' i never let on to mama about dell bein' the one i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? i didn't tell dell neither he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i didn't see the point somethin' terrible happened to him though six months ago
what's that peanut?
dell disappeared dell was learnin' a hard lesson what i learned from observin' dell is i think people who are frightened want to disappear he'd startin' behavin' weird? like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
well like mama told me aunt rootie dell's mama? she found cockroaches in dell's underwear
hell peanut
one time  real late  like about two thirty am? she found dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen
so you're going to fight fires now huh?
prob'ly the rain boys from outer space
it ain't so funny now though december before christmas? dell disappeared again and aunt rootie hired a private eye to find him he was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy santa claus suit
sound like ol' dell's more'n just a little confused peanut too bad he couldn't visit that ol' wizard of oz and get some good advice
too bad we all can't baby one thing about dell?
what's that?
when he was about seventeen he startin' losin' his hair
so?
he's twentyfour now? a year older than you? and must be 'bout bald
there's worse things that can happen to a man honey
yeah i suppose but you know somethin' baby hair does make a difference
not likely
we gotta be careful honey my mama's gonna have johnnie farragut on us like a duck on a june bug and he's one clever detective? you know how clever? he once told me that he could find an honest man in washington my toenails gotta dry first anyways sailor
one thing puzzles my mind sugar you're twenty years old  aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? puttin' a detective on us i'll tell ya lula well it's more'n me killin' bob ray lemon
maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much
yeah maybe
you up for that?
i'd got to the far end of the world for you baby you know i would
those toenails dry yet? we got some dancin' to do
yeah i had my first taste on that trip to juarez at that age you still got a lot of energy
you still got plenty energy for me baby
maybe two three months after juarez i was visitin' my cousin junior train in savannah and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town a girl comes up to me that was real tall taller than me
well see you're wrong already had a talk with chief fitzgerald and we decided in the interest of brotherly love that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town so starting tomorrow your assigned to company 17 my company  one case of scotch you're getting cheap in your old age brian
what'd you say to her?
told her my name then she said somethin' like 'it's so noisy down here why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' she turned around and led the way i knew i had an important lesson to learn that day
oh baby what a bad boy you are
that's just what she said i had a boner with a capital "o" i went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway i found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and penthouse magazines she was a wild chick she was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides you know them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
you mean like pedal pushers?
i guess
you're excitin' me honey what'd she do?
her face was halfpushed into the pillow and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said 'i won't suck you don't ask me to suck you'
poor baby she don't know what she missed what color hair she have?
sorta brown blonde i guess but dig this sweetie then she turns over peels off them orange pants and spreads her legs real wide and says to me
it's comin' along want a beer?
what do you mean by necessary? she's prob'ly already called the cops my parole officer her pi boyfriend johnnie farragut
i suppose so she knew i was bound to see you soon as you was sprung but i don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this i guess this means you're breakin' parole then?
you guess? my parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt portagee county
what'll it be like in california sailor do you think? i hear it don't rain much there
you got about six more big states to go before we find out
we got through two states already
it ain't it's part of the lessons of life i picked me up a pack of vantages before we left the cape?
they sure do stink
yeah i guess but  and here's the lesson part  they ain't supposed to be so bad for you
you ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour are you sugar? i mean here you are crossin' state lines with a anumber one certified murderer
it's old stuff adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway still good enough though for this tub
manslaughterer honey not murderer don't exaggerate
okay manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned
thank the lord well you ain't let me down yet sailor that's more'n i can say for the rest of the world?
what kinda trash talk is that?
what it says on the bumper sticker up front on that pickup
that's disgustin' those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public is this biloxi yet?
almost i figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat
got anyplace special in mind?
we oughta stay somewhere outta the way not in no holidays or ramadas or motel six if johnnie farragut's on our trail he'll check those first
looks more like the ghost of the old south but we'll try her
what you've never seen one before?
come look at this
what's that honey?
there ain't no water in the swimmin' pool just a dead tree fell in prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'
it's huge this musta been a grand old place at one time
let's get fed sweetheart the light's fadin' fast
lula i learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show i heard on the radio how leeches is comin' back into style
say what? honestly sugar you can talk more shit sometimes?
yeah it's a real problem for me sailor you know? when i went in that drugstore by the restaurant in biloxi? i saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in i'm not big on resistin' so what about a leech?
heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again just in old times you know when even barbers used 'em?
i got one on me at lake lanier lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off felt awful he was a cute boy though so it was almost worth it
in the field museum once
sailor? you expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
how they used to do it course they got more sophisticated ways now radio said the chinese i think it is figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose
honest lula i prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight but it's about what they said
honey we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject
we sure don't honey  get me a mounds?
you really are dangerously cute honey i gotta admit it
it's just another case sailor
what's that peanut?
one person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it
ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? sometimes i think it would be the biggest thrill?
i don't have a girlfriend
it works
my god  it better be darlin' cause it'd be the last what time is it?
shhhhh it's four o'clock that woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'? like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla maybe grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one
anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts sailor you tell me sailor who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
you got me peanut
you certain?
i ain't never met anyone come close to you sugar
recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the confederate soldier? leanin' against it and you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said 'you feel it beatin' in there lula? get used to it 'cause it belongs to you now' d'you recall that?
i do
i was hopin' you would i know that night by heart sometimes honey? i think it's the best night of my life
we didn't do nothin' special i can remember just talked is all
it worked when you were in sixth grade
talkin's good long as you got the other? i'm a big believer in talkin' case you ain't noticed
too bad they don't give an award for talkin' you'd win first prize especially with those tits
you think so baby? does my talkin' bother you honey?
no i like gettin' up around four am and talkin' bout wild animals though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream i kinda wish i didn't remember it up at pee dee i couldn't remember any of my dreams
what was this one?
it wasn't no fun lula the wind was blowin' superhard and i wasn't dressed warm only instead of freezin' i was sweatin' strong
boy sweetie this is weird okay
i know i kept walkin' i headed for your house only it wasn't your house really you let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me you kept askin' 'why'd you come to see me now? why now?' like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other
oh baby what an idea i'd always be happy to see you no matter what
i know peanut but it wasn't all like you were so unhappy i was there just you were upset my bein' there was upsettin' to you you had some kids there little kids and i guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute
millions stephen  and sexual favors
well i ain't upset about it darlin' just give me an odd feelin' there a minute is all
gotta hex from a voodoo?
who do?
you do
where?
never mind where get outta here i mean it sailor
i'm goin'
who knows baby?
he was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the cafe du monde do you think he saw us?
lula darlin' makes no difference anyway we're outta here
sheep don't count
he's just a regular guy't needs help honey look at him
i know you're thinkin' that i got more'n some of my mama in me? well i couldn't help it sailor i really couldn't i'm sorry for that guy but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awfulsmellin' meat out of his pocket? i near barfed and them poor diseased puppies
just part of life on the road peanut
do me a favor sailor? don't pick up no more hitchers okay?
hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this honey you don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door
maybe there's a place we could hear some music i feel like dancin' we could ask someone
we'll find out in a hurry
uh huh
you notice that woman when we come in? the white woman sittin' by herself?
yeah
yeah? what about laura 
well she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that i could tell what you make of that?
honey we bein' strangers here and all this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'
you think she's pretty?
mama i been thinkin' about her she's prob'ly worried to death by now
more'n likely
i want to call her and tell her i'm okay that we're okay
i ain't so sure it's a great idea but that's up to you just don't tell her where we are
pardon me? y'all got a phone here i can use?
it's me who's wastin' time sailor bein' with you
honey i'm sorry it wasn't nothin' come on and get up and we'll take off
that was never proved
leave me be for a minute? mama gets all insane and then i see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oiltown tramp how you figure i'm gonna feel?
told you not to call your mama
under a hundred
you want to stick around here sailor? see if we can get some work?
not in houston we'd be better off in some place more out of the way
you want me to drive for a stretch? give you a chance to rest
that'd be good lula
i can't take no more of this radio  i ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life sailor ripley you find me some dancin' music right this minute i mean it
this ain't news sweetheart i hate to tell ya
you know lula i never told you what all i was doin' before i met you
i wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment i mean is this really gonna have to one of those big brother  little brother "you broke my gi joe and i'm still pissed" games?
i just figured you was out bein' mr cool
not exactly sugar one reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what i was doin' i tried to tell you this before
you're scarin' me baby
well there's a good side as well as a bad side to it the good side is i knew your daddy and i thought clyde was a good ol' guy
you knew my daddy?
yes i did i sure did the bad side of it is i did some drivin' for a man named marcello santos
oh shit
i quit workin' for 'im but just before i did i ended up one night at a house i don't know what it is they all think i saw that night but i was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames
god sailor that's the night my daddy died
i know sugar but while the place was burnin' before santos came out  i pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin' afterwards when i met you i always liked to think i mighta saved your life
what is it with you man huh? how do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? that scotch bullshit? am i really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? you were bankrupt man
that's some big secret you been carryin' sailor

you upset with me?
no sailor darlin' just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were i been carryin' a secret too
they was laughin' arm in arm like animals
i didn't want to say it but i had a feelin' santos was up to somethin' with your mama
my mama  so sailor our histories have been somewhat intertwined
hey you don't know me 
they have sugar
i take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together
it's a comfortin' idea
well we're really out in the middle of it now ain't we?
there's worse places honey
if you say so
trust me on it
i do trust you sailor like i ain't never trusted nobody before
we'll be alright peanut long as we've got room to move

i know you cold brian the scary thing is you probably could have faked it for awhile but you see in this job there's no place to hide isn't like selling log cabins you have a bad day here  someone dies and that's not fucking good enough want another beer?
i don't know looks like clothes
one bad car accident
sailor

i don't understand this i don't understand this one bit he was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby somethin' bad has happened  i jus know it
i'm serious here
 i told you to stay next to me
perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer
hell no that's the last thing we need a buncha cops runnin' around
i'm sure i wouldn't know ma'am and buffalo hunting too hmmmmm?
and jus when my baby's out on some texas road with a killer
that's not why i called
oh yeah  sure okay
santos it isn't

lula's gone off with sailor
what do you want me to do about it?
 i was doin' it i was up there fucking doin' it you don't know man you don't know what i did
i want you to take care of sailor so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again
take care of him?
yes
what does take care of him mean? do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
what's with you? you know what take care of him means i don't call santos except for one big reason
big is the key word and i'm telling you i want it bad
i want you to get rid of sailor
get rid of him?
yes get rid of him
how would i do that? send him on a trip  like maybe to hawaii?
what you did was drop the ball probie get that right
santos why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
just tell me what you want
i don't need to explain anymore'n i have you know damn well
you need to explain it
all right i want you to kill sailor as simple as that
simple? kill him? how?
that's your business i don't care how
like an accident where maybe lula might also get hurt?
no for god's sakes santos
well like kill him with the atomic bomb?
 never mind
santos
explain it i told you
shoot him
shoot him? like with a gun?
yes
where? in the leg?
no
where?
in the head
shoot sailor in the head with a gun now i'm beginning to get it you want me to shoot sailor in the head with a gun
brian    see ya tonight
yes
but where in the head? not the chin i hope
no in the brains what little i'm sure he has
you want me to shoot sailor in the brains with a gun
yes
through the forehead?
yes
wrong it's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head right toward the bridge of the nose lots and lots of irreparable damage
see i knew you had it all under control
why didn't you send johnnie farragut?
hey
maybe i did try new orleans first lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town
on one condition
santos no please santos
you're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
no but
one day he's gonna find out what we're up to with mr reindeer and he could cause us a lot of trouble
santos i can't
shhhh it's all right also i either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed
you fucker don't you ever touch lula  you fucker i'll kill you
put your shoulders back
nah he's nothin' it's just sometimes sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out y'know?
what?
put your shoulders back i said
someone's gonna see us
that's just another part of the price to pay
santos you kill that sailor otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me
no
my very best to johnnie bless his soul
shhhhhh  thank you gentlemen i'll look after her now
hey stop the nervous crybaby routine you're my girl now santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy come on let's get outta here
where we goin'?
c'mon let's crawl home
got word the kids are moving through texas i think an ending is being arranged there come on lemme see a smile
please santos where's johnnie?
there's no way in hell you can speak to her and
what?
yes you heard me don't ever call back here again
no
well she wants to fuck you
whattya mean?
well johnnie told me you used to drive for clyde and santos
so?
this?
so maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire and you're gonna get burned baby and besides that you're shit d'you think i'd let my little girl go with shit like you? why you belong right here in one of these toilets
you're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from lula
oh don't worry 'bout that
it's a prob'lm i don't think's gonna go away too soon though peanut i'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny california
just passin' through on my way to who knows where
sure i figured i'd see you sometime
hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me i really need to know
by who?
i think santos or marietta fortune
heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter
yeah too bright
you heard right
you really are one dumb asshole
life is unpredictable
does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and santos killed her daddy?  does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around  till he started snortin' the shit himself?  does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
i didn't see nothin'
yeah but i did and i told you all about it
is there a contract? we made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard
i know i remember
well?
i ain't heard of nothin'
so am i
what are you kidding? by myself?
thanks
that's pretty simplistic don't you think?
hey pal you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens
excuse me did you or did you not have a gun to his head?
he was trying to steal my car
yeah but you gotta know what it's about right? i mean if you didn't know what it was about why were you writing it?
fascinating listen why don't you come out with us after the lecture there's a place on the hill i always get trip to take me
actually i just want to go home
oh don't be silly no one your age just wants to go home besides faculty will be present just think of it as a field trip
we're going to the men's room only we might not make it in time
you got a problem with drilling probie?
we're springing you leer get some pants on
the candelabras were my gran's
he's great come on let's blow before lo' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast
oh well that's just it she's been coming down here every half hour or so to sort of check on me if i'm not here she might call the police or something
hhhuh so we decoy her stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference
yeah like in against all flags only they use a couple big hams
so i hear
no offense professor tripp but you look sorta crappy
he's right you look horrible
ah right well i gave you my opinion
no lt i don't have a problem with drilling but let's just have one drill not one for the company and one for me
you're welcome
how are you crabtree?
brimming say hello to my new friend miss antonia uh
i sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling
your wife
oh we're picking her up downtown
perfect well then shall we?
lay off pittsburgh it's one of the great cities
if it can produce a miss sloviak you'll get no argument from me
she's a transvestite
roll the hose
you're stoned
she's still a transvestite
mm
isn't she?
great i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend think that might be possible?
i don't know i'm sort of at a critical juncture
i thought you were tinkering
i just mean
forget i asked i don't want to pressure you tripp but  i get pressure know what i mean?
it was jerry nathan's he owed me money
christ stephen let's wait for the hose team
he owes god money you know he queered himself for good with esquire
yeah between a bookie and a pair of broken legs
she left me crabs
left you? who? emily?
this morning i found a note in the kitchen
but why didn't you say something tripp? i mean what are we doing here?
piss off crabs i lost a wife today
oh i'm sure you'll find another you always do
primarily although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia you missed a few bottles by the way
i'm sure where is everyone?
listen to it brian jump when i say it won't get us
sara and walter declined guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog
i know he started it fall semester
he finished it winter break
no not yet he isn't
well i'm going to read it anyway
come on crabs don't do this he's one of my students for christ sake i'm not even sure if he's 
he is take my word for it
i think it's more complicated than that besides he's a little scattered he almost did something stupid tonight at least i think so anyway he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now
on the contrary it could be just the ticket
shut up and drink
i waited i would have fucking waited
huh uh a jockey his name's um curtis curtis hardapple
not curtis
vernon then vernon hardapple the scar's are from a  from a horse he fell during a race and got trampled
and now he's addicted to painkillers
he can't piss standing up anymore
he lives with his mother
and he had a younger brother who was a
groom named claudell and his mother blames vernon for his death
because because
he heard everything we were saying
that's not what it's about brian the point is there was a kid in there and what if there'd been two? i went in because that's what i do it's my way it's dad's way it isn't everybody's way
tripp
yes
hit your brakes
just go around him
back up go out the other way
where would we go?
shit
tripp where the hell
what? ohhhh is that it?
gee i don't know crabs i don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room
dad's way? where did he tell you that? in a fucking seance?
sometimes we have to improvise
think hannah does james have any friends i mean besides you and me?
james? my james? what's happened?
nothing he's just been sort of i don't know kidnapped
kidnapped? by who?
his parents
good god let's go rescue him
good idea crabs only one problem i don't know where they live
ah wait a minute the university must know where he lives
it's a little late to call admissions
you said you wanted to know something brian what did you learn today?  what do you say brian huh? time to move on?
is it a little late to call the chancellor?
maybe i don't know
love it's love parade  and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? you skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines
i've been doing this a long time tripp i feel this kid in my bones
only in your bones?
bad enough and god knows i don't exactly fit the new corporate profile
which is?
competence
what's to tell?
plenty i'm sure but for what it's worth
c'mon  you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity  she sees me differently
thanks for the insight
i told you they keep him chained in the basement come on
hey i heard all about it  the parents the grandparents the china town thing  and i believe you okay? that's why we're here now go get dressed
so sensitive
oh come on tripp cut the kid some slack
it's just ail that crap he spins out just once i'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth
the truth i know that's always been real important to you okay check this out
yees?
i'm afraid he's pretty worn out poor kid
nevertheless there's a police officer standing on the porch and i don't think he's going away
so what's the problem?
brian look 
there is no problem did i say there was a problem?
the chancellor's here? now?
evidently  coming
great between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet it's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail
find the jacket
oh huh exactly how do we do that?
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car
it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas
don't touch it
only now i'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly jerry's to give
just leave me alone okay?
so whose car is it?
my guess  vernon hardapple
the hood jumper?
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his
such as
'that's my car motherfucker'
uh huh so we find vernon we find the car we find the car
we find the jacket
there's only one problem tripp we don't know his real name we just made it up in fact we made the whole guy up
no wonder he screwed us over
had to take on another fire bare handed huh? had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie is that what happened? is it stephen?
call it a hunch
i have an alternate version of the first chapter
you'll be all right then look at carlyle when he lost his luggage
that was maccaulay
or hemingway when hadley lost all those stories
he was never able to reproduce them
bad examples look tripp i don't want to depreciate the loss here but perhaps  in a sense  this   is for the best
in a sense
i don't think so in my experience signs are usually a lot more subtle
oh right oola about that jacket
i had that fire he didn't listen
ah well congratulations meanwhile what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?
walter gaskell isn't going to send james leer to jail crabs i know that
do you know he won't expel him?
no but i don't think that matters
that's very enlightened professor it's comforting to know that america's children have you for a teacher
gee i don't know crabs  improvise you're good at that
i peeked
jeff sorry i didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago
don't sweat it well 'night jeff
oh professor tripp? you know last semester what i said that time in office hours  i hope there's no hard feelings
he didn't listen? he was a fucking candidate he was your responsibility he shouldn't have been there in the first place stephen  you burned him
no
i mean i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and  well  i was pretty bent in general
it's cool jeff really
i just want you to know that's why i dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo faulknerian nobody
hey jeff if you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango try the guy at the end of the hall
excuse me?
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500 you driving this car?
it's mine
bullshit it's mine motherfucker
you must be mistaken
fuck you
bullshit
you did
i've been doing that a lot lately
so i hear you've also been smoking a lot of marijuana i understand
do you think that's why i've been having these  spells?
how long have you been having them?
the last month maybe
how long have you been smoking marijuana?
spiro t agnew was vice president i believe
that's probably not the problem then what about your lifestyle any major changes recently?
just just wanted to say hello
i've been trying to finish a book
and your wife left you
is that in my chart?
i spoke with the woman who saved your life you're lucky she came along when she did
you need to see a doctor mr tripp an internist and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist as well
she told you about
her dog yes
actually it was her husband's dog
they're anxiety attacks? that's a little disappointing
better luck next time
so hello
so is my friend is sara still here?
no there's no one here
i have to see her as soon as possible
move away cupcake he's got a gun
who's got a gun?
you've got a gun motherfucker drop it
relax vernon
shut up  cupcake please inside
bullshit i know a gun when i see one and that's a gun
no really
you're selling dad's boat?
a manhattan book editor murdering a mormon girl's clutch
'fraid so
and you're saying it's some kind of sign? what the fuck's the matter with you?
shoot
as long as it looks like her i don't care you know what i'm saying?
no sweat only do me a favor?
sure
stop calling me vernon
grady it's sara thank god you're there you won't believe what's happened
could you hold on a minute honey?
you're her savior?  is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
yeah it's just another memory in my life right now and i got way too many of them
where are you grady? an elevator?
i'm in kinship listen sara there's some things we need to talk about
you're in kinship?
yes but that's not why i called
with emily?
what? no there's no one here i'm just just
just what? doing a little dusting?
are you there to not reconcile with her?
no sara you don't understand
trust me i understand i just want to say something to you grady
i really should get back there's there's something i'm supposed to do
yea?
how you choose to live your own life is your business but you be careful with that boy grady with james he belongs to somebody else
it's very convincing
it used to shoot these little paper caps but they don't make them anymore the caps
you carry firearms
no what gave you that idea?
relax james i'm not her father i just rent her a room
she likes old movies like i do that's all  besides she doesn't really know me she thinks she does but she doesn't maybe it's because she's mormon and i'm catholic
maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up it's inevitable that it will in some way
you're not like my other students james so what was the movie you two saw?
yeah? what have you got to do?  look at you look at your face all the things you must be thinking man you must really hate my guts well you know what? it's okay
huh? oh son of fury with tyrone power and frances farmer
she went crazy frances farmer
so did gene tierney she's in it too
sounds like a good one
it's not bad
they really hated it i think they hated it more than any of the other ones
well
it doesn't matter it only took me an hour to write
really? that's remarkable
i have trouble sleeping while i'm lying in bed i figure them out the stories
look stephen maybe we can talk about this some other 
a little
so what are you doing out here?
it's colder in there
you're right
heaven?
i saw a movie once part of it took place in heaven everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses like that at least that's the way i remember it
i'll miss my bus
this is worth it
that's really it
the one she wore on her wedding day?
 okay so you don't like me you don't like everything i've done what because i wasn't such a genius the way i raised you? jesus christ dad was gone what was i supposed to do? you tell me what the fuck was i supposed to do?
so i'm told
really?
really
like the lady herself
i guess walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things
you're really good friends with the chancellor aren't you?
i guess you must be if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this
right
maybe i'm feeling a little sad myself tonight
you mean with your wife leaving you and all?  hannah mentioned something about it about a note
 i tried y'know? helen's right i don't have all the answers but goddamn it i've got some  look you're gonna do what you have to and maybe i shouldn't have gotten in the way i'm your brother not your father go on you gotta go somewhere? go
yes well it's complicated james i think we should go now
i had to didn't i?
couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
no he was crazy i didn't  he looked  i thought 
okay okay take it easy don't freak out on me
he's dead james believe me i know a dead dog when i see one
yea james
what are we going to do with
you?
trust me james when the family pet's been assassinated the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman
saw what?
does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
i've got tenure
that's just what they used to say in the ads come on crabtree i know you're holding
whose tuba is that anyway?
miss sloviak's
can i ask you something about her?
she is ah here we go
most of the time he is james some of the time he isn't now what do we have here?
no thanks i'm fine without them
right that's why you were standing in the chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight you're fine all right you're fit as a fucking fiddle
when dad died i saw another fire
is he all right?
what's he saying?
mmrrmmm knap sap
you're welcome
i put you on the floor
oh
i thought you might  i don't know  swallow your tongue or something  i guess you really miss her huh?
i guess there's probably a story behind that
there is but it's not that interesting
sure
everybody did
who?
the guy on the phone
what'd he say?
he wanted to know if a grady tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 ford galaxie 500 with black interior
what'd you tell him?
yes
good james if the zodiac killer calls be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right
i thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something is that single spaced?
that's a big book you're writing
i think it's sort of writing itself at this point
i saw it before it got them i tried to yell but he asked me to look out for him and i didn't do it i let him die
wow hannah always swore you were working but 
but ?
nothing it's just that well it's been awhile since arsonist's daughter and some people  some of the kids in workshop  thought maybe you were
washed up?
blocked
ah i don't believe in writer's block
hm
how did i get here last night?
no one seems to know where you live james hannah thought you'd like my couch
and and before that did i do anything? anything bad?
you know what i'm saying here
jesus you been carrying that around for twenty years? for christ's sake you were seven years old you think he could have heard you in there?
well james you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia
well done james
i guess there's probably a story behind that
there is but it's not that interesting
so where have you been staying?
the bus station
but james i mean how long?
a couple weeks that's why that's why i had the gun for protection
jesus james you should've told someone
who?
i hate him so much sometimes stephen you don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on
i don't know  me
hm
shit james you're hungover what do you think's the matter with you?
yeah well actually
no
your aunt?
maybe
it's my father he gets it from his doctor
glaucoma?
colon cancer
maybe i do  what a fuckin' mess huh?  people can change brian
jesus james wow
where's that?
carvel
carvel? where's carvel?
outside scranton
i never heard of it
it's a hellhole three motels and a mannequin factory my dad worked there for thirtyfive years
your father worked in a mannequin factory?
seitz plastics that's where he met my mom she was a fry cook in the cafeteria before that she'd been a dancer
what kind of dancer?
sometimes right when you're looking at them
whatever kind they wanted her to be
james leer are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
i'm telling you what i was told by my uncle and he should know he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt
didn't you say your mom went to catholic school?
when we fall we fall hard
amazing
maybe i just needed the moment to present itself
kinship
kinship and what's here?
unless i miss my bet my wife
i don't know brian i don't know
that's right that one
how can you tell?
you can see the outline of a butt
smoke the rest of that joint james and you can start on the box
she came here we'll just wait in the meantime i need you to shimmy through
it's not that it just reminded me of  you know  of what's in the car in the trunk
oh right well let's try not to think about that
i know it's the house you want to wake up in on christmas morning  make yourself at home i'll be right back
i just wanted a little sip? tell me james exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy?
probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night
 what are you doing here?
you're mad at me aren't you?
what?
you're mad because i shot your girlfriend's dog
it wasn't her dog it's her husband's   who said anything about girlfriend?
sure you do you were thinking: 'that's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat' you were thinking 'i can't let that kid get on the bus alone  he might never get on the bus again' you were thinking: 'i've got to find a way to distract this kid' so you did it was  in its way  a noble act
thanks for the halo james but i've never done that much thinking ahead in my life  ever
i don't know james i don't know why i do half the things i do who does?  why do you wear that coat?
james fall semester first day of class it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat
because of my coat?
because you act like a goddamn spook all the time not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you
i saw adcox's back i saw the burn i put it there jesus christ stephen he's been killing people
jealous? of me?
not you your talent
the hell i am
yes you are my stuff stinks i know it you said so yourself
i never said that
yes you did last night to your friend crabtree "is he any good?" he said and you said: "not yet he isn't" i heard you myself
i didn't mean it that way
it's okay professor tripp carrie howard the others  they're right my stories are annoying they go on and on and on and the longer they go on the more annoying they become until finally you just want to grab something heavy and 
shut up james you're annoying carrie and howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about okay? the entire class combined  including the lovely hannah green  has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have okay?
who cares what i said last night james i  i was drunk i was stoned i'd been bitten by a dog my wife had left me how 'bout cutting me some slack?
i know
i'm sorry
and don't be so goddamn sensitive who cares what anybody thinks anyway? you want to be a good writer? you want to be a great writer? then stop giving a damn what other people think most of them haven't thought in years
arsonist's daughter meant something
in a minute get us a table
no thanks
that's why you're having them your spells
spells? jesus james you make it sound like we're in a tennessee williams play i don't have spells
what would you call them then?
i don't know 'episodes'
i eat
how do you know?
when?
when nobody's looking
okay
nowhere you just sit here and eat
james listen things  things are a little weird with me right now and i  well i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you and if you hang around me long enough something bad is going to happen trust me that's why i need you to go home understand?
i'm not going with them
james like it or not they're your parents
parents? they're not my parents they're my grandparents my parents are dead
six their plane went down right outside scranton
near carvel?
i knew when you came looking for the chemicals looking for me
i'm sorry about all that i just  i don't like to talk about my family they treat me like a freak  she makes me sleep in the basement of my own house it's mine my parents left it to me
that's why she hates me that's why she makes me sleep in the basement
in the crawl space with the rats and the casks of amontillado come on up
ah wear whatever you want
i'm fine right fit as a fucking fiddle
it's walter's dog and yes she does know but let's spare her the details come on your shoes are in the hail
i'm not worried you're not worried are you professor tripp?
i'm a little worried james
don't be i don't care if they expel me i probably should be expelled
well let's see if we can keep that from happening
now i do  back then was a different story
hey  i'm a professional
 what were they doing there?
yes james
even if i end up going to jail
i think maybe we're missing the point it seems to me james' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand he treats us like adults he respects us enough to forget us that takes courage
i think so what about you?
me? sure why?
just checking
ail right by the way his friend?
the answer's yes i think yes i don't know where are they exactly?
james'll know about george sanders
i thank you
they were for the fucking boat brian
and i love the inscription you wrote to me only i'm not quite the downy innocent you think i am
i hope that isn't true we need all the downy innocents we can get
do?
i just mean i  i guess emily isn't going to be there when you get home
i would if i knew where i was taking him
hannah are you telling me you don't know where james leer lives?
some apartment somewhere but i've never seen it
that strikes me as odd
james is odd i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights i dropped him there once but  come to think of it it wasn't even his aunt's house he said she worked there or something i don't remember
hhuh last time i saw it was
what are we going to do about this?
the one in your office? it's the best one for naps
i don't think it really matters hannah we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point
oh well i
grady
no it's okay i just can't believe i left it out in the open like that crabtree hasn't been in here has he? poking around?
i don't know  maybe  i don't think so
he shot the chancellor's dog didn't he? the blind one
actually he's not the chancellor's  what?
at first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon dr gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet 
jesus
i'll handle it
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in
crabtree? he doesn't even know james
who does?
i told you sewickly heights
but where? i need the street
i don't know grady i just dropped him on a corner
it beats 'what's your major?'
sure the keys are on the dresser next to to your book
that good huh?
no it's not that it's
we gotta go to rimgale stephen
uh huh well thanks for the thought but as shocking as this may sound i'm not the first writer to sip a little weed and furthermore it might interest you to know that one book i wrote as you say 'under the influence' happened to win a little something called the pen award which by the way i accepted 'under the influence'
chancellor
i got the message you called
i got the message you called too
i'm sorry it's these goddamned shoes i don't know how anyone actually walks in these things
that's funny i need to talk to you too  perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room professor tripp
i don't believe i know where the upstairs guest room is
well then i'd better show you terry 
walter just got it back from the framer today
all right this morning 
i'm his lt he's my responsibility i'll handle it me
i'm pregnant
well this is surprising does walter?
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising
she's left before
she's left the room before she always came back
simple
hm
my god i wear the same scent as a transvestite she is a transvestite isn't: she?
if she's not now terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening
has he asked to see the book yet?
shut up
yes
and? are you going to tell him?
no maybe i don't know i don't know what i'm going to do
neither do i
i guess you're going to have to chew it off then
is the thing  is it over?
almost want to sit up?  what's the matter?
nothing i think i twisted my 
don't i know what you're going to say
no really sara i don't think you 
"you never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be "
you love emily i know that and you need to stay with her
i don't think i really have a choice in that emily left me
she'll come back that's why i'm going to to not have this baby
no there's no way i mean don't you think there's no way?
well no i don't see any way  and i know how hard it is for you to  to lose this chance
no you don't and fuck you for saying you do and fuck you for "saying  for saying there's just no way because there could be a way grady
it's  it's a souvenir of baltimore
caps
you got me
i love you grady
oh shut up huh?  i think i broke my goddamn arm
totally i'm sorry a lot was happening this morning can you talk?
i heard
you heard? how?
a twelveyearold policeman came by the house this morning
did you confess?
really? that was fast
i'm kidding hello?
oh right ha listen about last night there is something i need to tell
are you limping? why are you limping?
hub? oh well that's part of what i need to
i'm sorry i'm sorry i thought i won't
did you pass out again grady? did you fall somewhere?
no i mean well actually yes sort of i don't remember listen sara i have to tell you something
all right
really sara i
i know that i know what's at stake here
no i don't think you do and besides i haven't decided yet
about the baby
that and you
james leer
what's he doing out there?
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs
jennifer
i'm sort of helping him work through some issues
i tried to call but apparently there's something wrong
it seems one of our students is  missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed
i'm sorry sara i've been trying to tell you it's all my 
inside
and the jacket?
over there in the backseat of the
grady
honestly someone stole my car i parked it right there last night
are you sure you parked it there?
you're back
of course i'm sure ah christ the puberty police are back
would walter really press charges?
it's within the realm he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning
i think i might have
and what do you think you might have said?
i think i might've said i was in love with you
he told me
and what did you say?
i said it didn't sound like you
i believe you did that nice doctor let you out? or is this you improvising again grady?
you look great
i'm through improvising
terry told me about wonder boys is it true? did you lose it all?
i lost it all
oh grady you're such a putz
i know
and you're old
dozens it's very sad
oh?
i guess you have to go on faith
some times
thanks for calling
i told walter
does he still love you?
it didn't come up
in the hospital i was kind of excited about it at the time but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers
i know but sometimes
terry was telling me about you on the plane it was all so interesting
why yes how did you know?
lucky guess
it's mrs gaskell's her hobby
he's still barking at me he's blind
uh i've been sorta keeping a low profile the academy i graduated today
i'm your man
james is i don't know
disturbed and when your friend crabtree gets done with him he's going to be even more disturbed
i'm not sure that's possible
sure it is
tony now that i'm home
tony i'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight with terry
forget it i should've known better your friend is just i don't know into collecting weird tricks mind?
what's that?
like most editors he really wants to be a writer but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one
huh
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit
he'd call it habit but now i get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit
jesus is that what he told you?
he said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks he's kind of a
it's a bathtub what she's standing under
yes?
it's grady walter

i was thinking of you
and?
it's no arsonist's daughter but i guess you know that it's a young man's book it got me remembering how it felt to be young

pills august 25 1972 in a costa brava hotel room

i haven't heard of half of those
i doubt i'd recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it

you want to keep him happy
if he's happy  i'm happy

how is she?
oooh very sophisticated having fun?
annette? she's good tense
when can i see her?
i'm working on it
is it because of anna?
i don't know she won't talk about it
you're the only one in the family who still talks to me
i remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor annette married" except her brother you treated me with respect  look you paid your dues your slate is clean now
how old is anna?
she'll be twelve next week we're throwing a big party on saturday wish i could ask you to come
only if it's no closer than a hundred feet
carrying swayzak's notebook?
this little table is one heavy bitch
huh?
it's made from cherry that's a hard wood
it's a nice table
yeah it's really nice
it was a beautiful present
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?
you need a table
she was going to throw it out wasn't she? just toss it like a scrap of wood
it wasn't like that
let me tell you something martin swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor
then what? what?
she's got all this new furniture now she said it didn't fit anymore so i kept it in the attic i thought you might like it

what's that?
annette will see you
when?
soon
next week? the week after?
early july
tell annette i'm busy in july
c'mon walter
why do you think marty came here tonight? because he cares about your department you don't know how hard he works you don't know about his programs helping west side 
you should see my appointment book it got crazy
it's not what you think
isn't it?
the important thing is that you and annette need to talk she needs to see you and you need to see her
i'm not a monster
you're a good man walter okay you did some wrong things but inside you're a good decent man
maybe i'm not a good man maybe inside i'm bad and i'll always be bad
don't talk like that
you don't have to tell me this
i'm just talking man
 all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt
carlos i never raped a woman
i know i'm just saying i understand
maybe because you're looking her in the face
sure
nothing
ask me ask me anything
did you ever do you have feelings for anna?
i mean feelings
birds
there's a million birds here
i took her there for a shower and that's it
bullshit marty's plan is only about efficiency i've got two cousins on the job you think i'd work for him if i didn't believe in it?
in that birch tree is a nest
sure
is that right?
i don't like starlings
why not?
they're extremely aggressive birds plus their habits are rather filthy
the mother sure has her hands full
when i go birdwatching it's why i like coming here
it's just a city park
you'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here last week i saw a purple martin and the week before that i saw a solitary vireo that's rare
yeah well i like to think i'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters
a solitary vireo i like that one
their sound is quite musical
how does it sound?
it's hard to describe
try
i can't
i bet you can
it's a bright sound
that was terrific
you should hear the bird
i seem to remember some pretty good nights on jp ii
you live around here?
not too far  are you a birdwatcher too?
me? nah i'm more of a people watcher
were you watching me?
not at first you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently any second i thought you would take off and fly
i have to go
do you come here often?
my daddy likes me home before dark
it's good to listen to your daddy
not yet
c'mon jennifer he's just another northside jagoff with a mouth
it's my bird book
i have friends
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends
i'm not pretty
well not in the common way
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked most people only notice birds with the brightest colors
robin
cop
have a seat
i have no idea
brian do you always have to be so stupid? think about your future for once
i think you do
why don't you just tell me?
then you won't mind if i look around
i would
got something to hide?
doesn't everybody?
i could get a search warrant
if you could you would have brought one today
yeah
unusual design for a contemporary piece
so now you suddenly care about my future?
who said i wanted to buy it?
you can't talk to me like 
like a piece of shit? in my eyes you are a piece of shit think anyone would miss you if i threw you out the window right now? i could say you jumped when i came in who are they going to believe? not you because you'd be a dead piece of shit
okay
what?
they grow outside don't they?
sure they do but outside they've got trees around them the trees shade them from the sun of course the plants enrich the soil around the trees one of nature's symbiotic relationships
you going to take me on a nature walk?
don't be witty  yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work but instead of getting off at your normal stop for some reason you stayed on why did you stay on the bus walter?
i fell asleep
look i didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there i just thought you'd call when you came back you didn't and  don't blow it just because of this garbage between us
yes
fairy tales?
do you believe in them?
no
neither do i  what's the one with the woodsman?
woodsman?
the one with the ax?
i don't know
sure you do he cuts open the wolf's stomach and the girl steps out alive
little red riding hood
hey sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss but i'm not gonna be a poster boy for him i'm trying to do something here there's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day tell swayzak to talk to one of them
that's it little red riding hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch  ever see a sevenyearold girl sodomized almost in half?
what?
the girl
know what?
i'll be asking the questions  last night you hear anything unusual? screams? shouts?
no
a man was badly beaten across the street you know anything about that?
i was asleep
i didn't say what time the assault occurred
you said last night i went to bed pretty early
okay i'll arrange things with your assignment captain  marty's a good man brian
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty
i went to bed around seven
i could take you downtown
you could it'd be a waste of your time though
i suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty medium height medium weight medium build probably not too many men fit that bill
just give me a straight answer walter cause the irony goes right over my head
i have a passionate girlfriend
what's with the boxes?
you're a cop figure it out
i'd say you're moving
yeah
it's a free country isn't it?
yes
then i'd say you're a lucky fellow
i count my blessings
well i guess i'll be seeing you
'fraid not
i'm adjusting okay

straightest answer your department's given me all week
it gives me headaches
but you are taking it?
yeah

why's that?
you don't want to know but he's damaged goods  real damaged goods if you know what i mean
yeah marykay i think i do thanks a bunch for the advice
well mary you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe you do know what runs out of a sewer pipe don't you?

lovers' quarrel?

i'm twelve
no you're not
i will be in three months  i can't wait i hate being eleven it has to be the stupidest age in the world
do you have many friends?
no
how come?
a long time ago i was sent far away when they let me come back all my friends were gone
boss and i are up to about three words an hour
it sounds like you were banished
banished yeah
birds are my friends that sounds egotistical but they are birds know i watch them but they don't mind because they like being watched if they know you won't hurt them
robin?
yes?
would you like to sit on my lap?
would you like to sit on my lap?
no thank you

i'm sure thank you all the same
green committed to a thousand  there's another fundraising party tonight marty'd really like you to come

ms kramer

i said the job is okay
that's right you did  have you made any friends there?
i'm not running for mr popularity
hey  so are you dating your boss or what?
you seem a little hostile today
that was a joke
no need to call me doctor i'm a therapist not a psychiatrist
it's all the same
what?
i'd like you to keep a journal
a diary?
that's right
no way
why not?
if you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that i'd probably be pissed  boy you sure know it's a man's world sometimes
diaries have sent too many guys to prison
i don't understand
evidence
oh it never crossed my mind
of course
it was just an idea
bad idea
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect
reflect
that's right
sorry  are you dating anyone?
you think reflection is good
it's very good indeed
how's that?
by reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life we gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships our careers and our goals
no fucking way
then think about it
i'm still thinking about it
i wish you'd give it a try
it's okay
but you don't like coming here be honest walter
you think that's really any of your business?
honest? no
good that's an honest answer and why don't you like coming here?
honest? your cheery personality makes my skin itch
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
forget it
maybe it's the way i look or the sound of my name
rosen? i don't have a problem with that
because if you did i know a therapist named ryan i also know a therapist named chung
i don't need someone else
i don't feel anything
no i don't think you were a fool i just think you were stupid about it  i mean to say the least you outta know better  you don't know her well enough she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her it's fuckin' over  you can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference you're dead
well you did invite me here
you have no feelings for your niece?
she was born after they put me away how can i have feelings?
then why are you talking about this?
have to talk about something
what are you afraid will happen?
i'm not afraid i'm just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer
have you talked to carlos about your concerns?
i'm not that crazy
do you think you're crazy?
if i'm not then what the hell am i doing here?
marty did  but i wanted you to come to
why do you think you're here?
you know why it's part of the parole deal
is that what you are angry about?
talking to you is like riding on a merrygoround
that is a marvelous image walter because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around
we have a few more minutes
i mean when will i be normal
we have a lot of work to do
will i ever be normal?
i couldn't say
boy rimgale's as slow as a snail isn't he?
you couldn't say
i'm afraid not
do you know what "normal" is?
i suppose it's however society defines it
how do you define it?
i don't
then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
they usually tell me
how do they know?
what is your idea of being normal?
no he's more of a dinosaur guy's not a dummy though he's juggling alot of balls on this one
what is your idea of being a jew?
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you  why don't we continue this on thursday
i want to be normal
then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal
fuck you rosen
i know 
you don't know
i know you're frustrated walter but 
what did you think would happen?
i don't know
yeah but it doesn't take albert einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not
what did you want to happen?
i don't know
is this the first one?
of course it is that's why i'm telling you
i want you to calm down
i want to talk about it now
we'll talk about it more on thursday
remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
go home walter
now i know it's when i can see a girl be near a girl even talk to a girl and walk away  that's my idea of being normal
jesus give him a break there isn't enough proof yet to go public sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts but you can't rush this stuff not 'till it's locked
sorry
please don't do it again
i said i was sorry
i can't move my patients around to accommodate one person
you mean my problem?
if by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls yes
i don't know
that's not a helpful answer
that's my answer
what?
but rimgale's probably going to come around to arson
i'd like you to close your eyes
why?
to relax
i'm relaxed
close your eyes and let your mind be blank
hey rosen you going to hypnotize me?
okay eyes closed mind a blank i'm all yours do it rosen
nothing can i open my eyes?
no when i say the word "pretty" when i say the word "pleasure" what is the earliest memory you see?
i don't see 
in a dinosaur kinda way yeah
in your mind walter take your time
i see my sister
not so fast
sorry  where is she?
in my bedroom sleeping
where?
in my bed rosen where do you think?
where are you?
in my bed too
how old are you and your sister?
got anything to drink in there?
we're little kids
but roughly how old?
i'm maybe about six which would make her four
just lying there  we're taking a nap
a nap?
yes a nap kids do that you ever take a nap rosen?
did you and your sister often take naps together?
i want you back in your chair right now
all right
i don't like nobody behind my back
oh there might be something stashed away for emergencies
i'm sorry i shouldn't have been there
nothing
did you touch her? did you take off her clothes? did you take off your clothes?
this is garbage
i'm only asking questions
okay i'll tell you what i did  just to shut you up  i smelled her hair
what else?
that's all i just liked smelling her hair
you felt pleasure
yes
i told you you know i thought i was doing the right thing you know i think she's innocent
homey
i was six years old
i meant later when you two took naps
it was a small house
all right a small house with small rooms
i smelled her hair that's it i just liked smelling her hair
accept you?
time
how do you feel about that?
i feel okay
are you okay?
see that trap door up there? that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horsedrawn engines it was pretty different then but kinda the same y'know?
yeah i'm fucking fantastic
i'm all right
it's fucking freezing out here
what picture?
i'm talking about you
me?
yeah you
people without cars
no weirder than a sharp young good looking woman working in a lumberyard
what's weird about that?
do you miss it?  you seem like you do
most women wouldn't choose it
guess i'm not like most women
i'm just quiet
you don't hang out with the other guys
neither do you
they're all assholes
i thought you were a dyke
what do you think?
what?
your windows face south northern light is the purest but southern light is very good
when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman
i'll buy a plant
you should buy several i've got shitty light in my place but my plants don't seem to mind light's important but it's not everything
sorry
k through sixth
doesn't it get noisy?
i like the noise
my place faces a truck street i've got cracks in every window from the shaking
you must hate it
i go backpacking a lot lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two
what about them?
then why did you quit?
they could eat you
yeah they could
what?
you're damaged
yeah?
i get that impression
so what's your dark secret?
why do you want to know?
don't you think i should know before we have sex?
what?
i wanted to be a good one
are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
not tonight
you're still here
i didn't say i didn't enjoy it
of course sorry i'm such a fucking asshole
no you're not
don't tell me i'm not a fucking asshole when i know i'm a fucking asshole
you think i have a problem?
do you?
it's been a while since
uh huh
since you've had sex?
maybe later
how about in the morning
the morning?
i thought i'd stay the night
what for?
well walter this is going to sound offthewall but i like to sleep with a man after we fuck
i suffer from insomnia
is that all?
when i do sleep i sweat a lot usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming
you told swayzak about our arson lead it's all over the fucking news
i sleep like a dead horse anything else?
hi
because i like you
the worst?
yeah
i molested little girls
molested little girls?
yeah
twelve years in prison is no joke
how many girls did you molest?
i didn't know it was a secret there aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators 
what did you do to them?
it's not what you think
how young?
between ten and twelve once a nine yearold told me she was eleven once a fourteenyearold told me she was twelve i always asked how old they were
twelve years in prison?
the judge had a thing about sex offenders later i heard his daughter had been raped if i hadn't had a good lawyer it would have been twenty five to thirty
i told you i'm not easily shocked
you should be shocked or do you get off on this shit?
what?
get your kicks somewhere else
 bullshit you knew what i told you wasn't ready for the papers 
hey i'm not 
depraved? my mistake
walter
no never again
you don't really 
yes i want to know
no prison is time that's it you think time you feel time you hear time your heart doesn't beat to live it just beats time
i'm sorry walter
don't be sorry for me i did those things no one else did i'm dealing with that
sounds like a special guy
well it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not  don't you understand that's why you're a professional
will you please keep your voice down there's people 
my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave
why young girls walter?
their power they seduce me
they seduce you?
i was always the one seduced
you really believe that?
no that's what i used to tell myself
and what do you tell yourself now?
nothing it's over
bullshit
 you could have scared the son of a bitch off we may never bust him now all for a couple's political points
what?
being here with me
i know
most people say the odds are against me
what odds?
the percentages 
well most people are stupid  you want to talk about odds? one day i'll tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons you wanna talk about odds?
why not tell me now?
which brother did this?
all three  in chronological order
i was doing my job
you must hate your brothers
i love my brothers
no you don't
i love all of them they're strong gentle men with families of their own and if you asked them about what they did to me they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you
you never asked them about it?
are you serious?
not ever?
not ever
what?
us seeing each other
yeah? and just how much of all this has been "doing your job"?
i'm not scared
neither am i
maybe you should be
live together
move in with me
i think it's a fucking good idea
just think about it
i've got problems
who doesn't?
most people don't have my kind of problems
let me ask you something do you really think marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? who the hell are you kidding? i was there remember? i saw you and your brother 
guess that makes you pretty special
that's not what i meant

bud why are you doing this?  it's not part of you life any more
i'll tell you what happened you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh
swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered i want to know why he keeps that hidden
you're right bud  it was just that simple aren't you clever?  you should get your own show ask dr bud advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms
no  look forget it  i don't want to talk about it
fine  be that way
i don't know what i saw  okay?  coffey wants to call it a russian submersible fine  it's a russian submersible  no problem
but you think it's something else  what?  one of ours?
no
whose then?  lindsey?  talk to me
his mixture got screwed up  he panicked and pranged his regulator
but what did he see that made him panic?
what do you think he saw?
i don't know anything about it
i don't know  i don't know
cute virgil
i can get power to this module and subbay if i remote these busses  i've gotta get past the mains which are a total meltdown
thanks  no i can handle it  bud there won't be enough to run the heaters  in a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker
what about o2?
brace yourself  we've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using
the storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours
i can extend that  there's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module  i'll have to go outside to tie onto them
yeah?  well i'm not
if you say so  it could be anything
you could check it'd be in his files
i'm telling you what is there  you're just not hearing  the impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan  there's something down there  something not us

how can i go on a feeling?  you think coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
do you know what you're asking me to do?
we all see what we want to see coffey looks and he sees russians he sees hate and fear bud you have to look with better eyes than that
lindsey  wait a second
chill out lindsey
look the guy's operating on his own cut off from chain of command  he's exhibiting symptoms of pressureinduced psychosis  and he's got a nuclear weapon  so as a personal favor to me will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?

that's it then  finler mcwhirter dietz and perry  jesus
do we just leave him there?
yeah for now  our first priority's to get something to breathe

how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer  here here's a number of an immigration lawyer  that's how you help her but you can't get involved in her like that  you're gonna jeopardize your career your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case  and lemme give you another piece of advice  maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret  the whole fuckin' world watches television  and when you get out there they know your face  and the little fame the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job  and i get more done because of it
you're right

you're right i don't  i just need to know that this thing is out of here  you hear me roger ramjet?
i'll see ya around huh?
mrs brigman you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission  i believe the stress is affecting you  escort her to quarters and have monk prepare a tranquilizer
gotcha cab three  who is that?  that you lindsey?

nonterrestrial intelligence  ntis  yeah i like that better then ufos  although that works too underwater flying objects
well yeah but the tether off it ain't gonna be fancy  when he gets down there he'll just sit like a dumbshit  unless something wanders through view of the camera you'll get nada
let's go for it  we could get lucky
i gotta tell you that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there  aj squared away goddamn jarhead robot  okay gimme a couple hours on this
it's a small town
that guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat
he couldn't be that dumb  the guy's a trained killer  bud's idea of a fight is armwrestling one night over laundry duty
shut up hippy  bud how you doing?
what kind of luminous things bud?
how deep?
deep  it's classified you know  anyway you breathe liquid so you can't be compressed pressure doesn't get to you
check this out
perry stand by on the rov  sorry about this little buddy  better you than me know what i mean?
it's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe
what's the timer set for?
hey do i know you?
very good  about one person in twenty just can't handle it  they go buggo  they're no way to predict who's susceptible so stay alert
bud according to monk here you just set a record for the deepest suit dive  bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning
ask him a pressure effects  tremors vision problems euphoria
ensign monk want to know how you feel
bud it's the pressure  try to concentrate concentrate on my voice  just listen to my voice
i know how alone you feel alone in all that cold blackness but i'm there in the dark with you bud you're not alone
he's hallucinating badly
through three miles of water?   i don't know
she'll wait
i don't know it depends on ettore he's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in sicily
so you came to me  well this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all
then how come you're not with him?
what a question because i want to be with you naturally i hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days isn't this water wonderful
what could be more restful than this?  excuse me what is it that you want to try?
fine can't you see so yourself?
wait for what?
you'll get over it soon it's the usual anxiety
a little more so this time
so it will just take you a little longer to get over it
but i think we should talk about it or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
there will be plenty of time to talk about it later  we'll  get married  soon  that way we'll have more time
who's doing this?
in this case getting married means nothing aren't we already the same as being married? and corrado and giulia  aren't they already the same as being married?
but why rattle your brains by arguing and talking believe me anna words never help at all they only serve to confuse i love you anna isn't i that enough?
no it's not enough i told you before that i would like to get away for a while and be alone
but you just said that a month was too
i mean to stay away longer  two months a year three years yes i know it sounds absurd and i feel awful the very idea of losing you makes me want to die and yet i i just don't have the same feeling for you any more
and what about yesterday at my house didn't you have any feeling for me even then?
there you go must you always spoil everything
i'm thirsty
if i had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom i hadn't seen for a month 
what after giving us such a run around
your first question should be who isn't it isn't a spark brian not enough damage and an insurance pro? where's the profit margin?
yes fairly well but i went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things  instead i fell asleep
i didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht it lulls you 
this one is gorgeous
then why don't you try it on?
i'm certainly not going to swim across
we'll send the raft back to you
no dad it isn't
four or five days
oh very well i'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest i should be used to it by now
to the fact of my retirement not only as a diplomat but also as a father
as in
you know i don't know  i like you you remind me of a puppy i used to have he pissed on the rug all the time but i still kept him
then who 
but how could you say such a thing?
because it's true after thirty years  not having ever spoken the truth to anyone i should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter
and have you any other truths to tell me?
you already know what they are
you mean sandro don't you?  well i beg of you please spare me that goodbye dad
it's the same thing goodbye dear
without any doubt sir if anything belonging to the girl who has run away is still here on this island
allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive
i'm sorry sir i didn't mean to put it that way but you must understand sir that i
i understand very well only i don't want any rash assumptions to be made
 no no your turn tell me a story
sir if you have no objections may we start the search?
it takes about twenty to twentytwo hours for the current to reach here from lisca bianca
and you say that came from lisca bianca?
it couldn't have come from anywhere else at least somewhere from that vicinity but i really can't understand it contraband cigarettes on that island it's the first time that ever happened
look i'd like to get back to lisca bianca
but how could weat a time like this when we just well let's at least first have a look around the other islands could be that something might turn up there
but even here we were supposed to find who knows what and all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes
as you wish
that must be basiluzzo
sounds like the name of a fish  merluzzo basiluzzo
i don't have a story
at what?
at the ruins they're very ancient you know
well what?
have you decided?
all i said was that it sounds like a good idea
that's patrizia's way of letting us know she's with us
more so than the shark?
there's no comparison
then why don't we go up and see the ruins?
but anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here
sure you do
maybe you'd better ask him
what were you and anna arguing about? excuse me for being so indiscreet but this is serious
that seems to apply to you also
how should i be  arrogant?
but of course arrogant haughty hasn't anna ever told you?
and that's what i say too we could have all been killed
oh no please not here  it looks too dangerous
and why haven't they left each other?
i'm beginning to have my doubts it couldn't be that they're in love?
could be they're the kind of people who are capable of anything
what?
no
and why do you tell us this only now?
i i don't know i didn't think it was worthwhile she was laughing over it
and how do you explain that?
but why don't you tell him?  a girl who was with us has disappeared
rather than being so occupied with my thoughts you would have been better off trying to understand what anna was thinking
i'm sorry about last night please forgive me
you're very fond of anna aren't you?
yes very much so
has she ever spoken to you about me?
you gotta tell a story too brian it's fair c'mon don't think too hard 
occasionally but always with affection
and yet she seemed to feel that our love for her  mine yours even her father's in a certain sense  weren't enough for her or didn't mean much to her
i know i keep asking myself what i could have done to prevent all this from happening
yes maybe that is better
yes
then i'll go with you
yes i had also thought of going there to talk with them
yes you should go
but then when will we see each other?
i don't know why i just couldn't help it
i i thought it was great i loved it it was nothing to these guys medium deal
but sooner or later we've got to end this relationship and it's better to do it right now
i have no desire to sacrifice myself it's idiotic to sacrifice oneself why? for whom? if anna were here i might understand your scruples but she's not
oh sandro
i'm sorry i didn't want to sound cynical but isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
for me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago  just three days ago don't you realize? and you and anna no i guess they aren't like that any more my god is it possible to forget in such a short time for things to change so quickly?
it takes even less
but it's so sad so terribly sad i'm not used to it i'm not ready for it you know i have never been so upset in my life sandro why don't you help me?
i think the only way to help ourselves claudia is for us to be together
no i'm sure it won't move over there let's make believe nothing happened and when we get to the next station get off
and what about you?
right light smoke low roll couple'a civilians hollering  medium deal so young fireman adcox and captain mccaffrey they head up stairs get out on the fire escape  mccaffrey does the ballsy jump across what were you feeling brian?  c'mon you promised be honest  okay guard
me i i please leave me alone
no sandro please i ask you as a favor
but why claudia? why?
yes but it's all so conflicting however there is some slight indication
who knows why they all left
are you joking?
don't think that i want to save myself from any embarrassment from the awkwardness of meeting anna it's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone please sandro do try to understand me it would look like i was trying to influence you to force you to control you and that makes me feel uncomfortable
oh sandro i'm so ashamed of myself so ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so small i hate myself 
does it please you to say such things?
oh no it doesn't please me at all
 i wanted to be him right then i wanted to be him more than anything
then why do you say them?
because what i'm doing is so ugly  because if you told me right now: "claudia i love you" i would believe you
but just think  the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times maybe even just before we left while i was waiting outside your place
so even if i did say them i was sincere with her as i am now with you
and why did you drop them?
once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school it took me only a day and a half to finish it and i got paid six million lire ever since then i've been doing estimates for other people's designs
i'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things
i don't know about that and then who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
what get married?
yes we'll get married you and i what do you say?
very good brian  about your report here the way to a torch's heart is through his tools that's how you know him it's the way he talks to the fire and to you if you listen
what do i say? what can i say? no at least not yet i don't know i can't even think of it at a time like this oh but why did you have to ask me?
you look at me as though i had said something foolish
and are you sure you want to marry me? are you really surethat you want to marry me?
that's why i asked you
so oh how i wish that everything were so much simpler that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes what size shoe do you wear? size 9 that's a very lovely size but i'm sorry i wear size 8
hurry up now or it'll begin to get hot outside
yes yes yes yes right away
as soon as you're ready you can come down and catch up with me i'll be waiting for you right outside on the square
so you wonder why?
okay in a few minutes
what do you want?
the outlets
nothing
why?
no reason why
and aren't you pleased? that way you'll have a new kind of adventure
i was only joking really can't i make a joke? and now you've got to tell me why you don't want to
oh sandro i want everything you do but
yes she started to but i didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say if we had to listen to everybody
no sandro we should go besides we haven't been in touch with anybody not even with anna's father we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned let's be fair he must be feeling awfully lonely
i don't doubt it but at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him and as far as telephoning him who knows where he is?
aren't you going to change?
that's a probie answer you're smarter than that brian
you said you wanted to quit working for ettore
why?
i'm too sleepy
sleep is something one must learn to overcome i learned how to do it when i was a child i never slept and i had friends who even slept less than i did the one who went to bed first paid a penalty and we really didn't do anything after seeing a movie we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere listen to some drunkard watch them putting up posters or manifestoesor look at the sheep passing by or go for a stroll around the market place or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name
late very late
good night tell me that you love me
i love you
tell me once more
i don't love you
i deserve it
trychticholorate
better dead
i would say he's pretty depraved
oh no; quite the contrary he's really just a child
one would have to be in love with somebody to know that
have you ever been in love?
not really it's suffocating in here shall we go out?
calm? he doesn't seem so to me he was awake all night
to do what?
i just can't leave without first searching those islands one by one
but aren't you tired? i can just about manage to stand on my feet  raimondo
good  so our two heroes adcox and mccaffrey they go back inside only there's another fire in there nobody sees and it took your dad didn't it brian? did you see him burn?
it was futile we went all over
you say that just to flatter me
do you consider that a compliment?
no
but then why did you bother changing?
quieter? oh yes of course
you shouldn't always take me seriously actually i'm used to it by now first my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos
what do you mean by sensible?
it means being without money
i imagine he must be inside sleeping
after it took your dad the fire did it look at you brian? did it talk to you?
would you please see if sandro is with him? he's not in his room i'm sorry to disturb you
more or less we are all afraid especially at night
i'm afraid that anna has come back i feel she's back and that they're together
but what's gotten into you? we would have known sandro must be out in the garden somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or watching the break of dawn it would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type
just several days ago the thought of anna being dead would have made me sick and now i don't even cry i'm afraid she might be alive everything is becoming so damned simple and easy even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering
you should never wish to get melodramatic over anything
yes you're right i'm sick and tired of being like that
to the shark
but for what reason should i come there?
please do come don't leave me alone with him he's capable of i don't know have you noticed his eyes?
not such a far walk after all is it brian?
but why all nudes?
it couldn't be any clearer
i think all you have to do giulia is to close the door
i detest comparisons made with oil
you must know your third grade geography book inside out
there's a shark in the area don't move from where you are
who's moving?
do you know why? because if you saw those ruins i'm sure you would have said they were very very beautiful you always say "how beautiful" to everything  whether it's the sea or a baby or a cat you have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything
but corrado  if something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
he never misses a chance to humiliate me to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more
you walked out on this academy six years ago one week to graduation you think we forgot that? you think i did?
giulia that remark is not worthy of our twelve years of honest concubinage i repeat once and for all and publicly that i admire you does that please you?
please giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? i can see for myself that the weather is changing
but why? what if it starts to rain?
if it rains i'll buy myself an umbrella
what do you think?
we too you know it was disastrous first at panarea where there weren't any boats then at lipari where everybody was asleep and the phone call to rome
really so that you can stuff it with your geraniums
when one approaches fifty my dear he is affected only by the cold
there too
well we're still in italy you know
i want another shot sir
me? i no longer have any interest in building and then where can you find boulders of rock like this in milan?
then let's get started it's senseless to waste any more time
i'll go even further and say that her presence here  i don't want to sound offensive  could be a great hindrance
we'll try again
so the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers could it be possible then that anna?
i wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff  maybe right here at lisca
i was saying it might even be possible that anna had left with them
but for what reason would she have wanted to go away?
listen marshal as for there being reasons for going away anyone of us might have three thousand of them so you can assume that she had them what i want to know is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
i think it's possible
look everybody remembers your old man being his son all you had to do was breathe to graduate here dead hero father rule but you blew us off why should i take you back?
this is claudia anna's friend  you've never met my husband have you?
it wouldn't really do you any harm to skip a meal
what is it?
nothing nothing  at all i was just looking for sandro
and you expect to find him in here? go and ask claudia
yes yes of course
what has everybody got against me this morning?
ask her
giulia don't you understand that the more involved you become with people the more difficult it is to speak with them?
you men are all so dreadful
if you remember sir my test scores were in the top 
i know we are but as the years go by we become even worse isn't that so corrado?
anybody can hold a brush in his hand all you need is to buy some oils and start painting even rembrandt did the same
here i am
and where do you find the models?
oh there are as many as one wants
i thought the model was something obsolete nowadays didn't you claudia?
but how could they pose like that? i couldn't
why don't you try?
me goffredo you're mad  he's mad
answer me why don't you try posing? i'll paint you a beautiful portrait
your opinion  you see they going to make a movie about me too eddie  and write books
 i don't give a damn what your test scores were maybe you could have been a good firemen but you had your shot
but why me? ask claudia she's much more beautiful than me
but i want to paint you you appeal to me more
i appeal to you more?
yes sir my sister is sick and my father too
so that's why you've turned to smuggling eh? you need the money now i can help you i can see that you get some assistance from the government but first there's a little formality we've got to take care of just a few questions and then we can all go to lunch your friend tells me you dropped anchor three times
now we're getting somewhere they're beginning to contradict each other  now look here your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough and what about the other boat?
what other boat?
now look my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard what have you got to say about that?
i  i  wasn't feeling well  i i was sleeping i don't know anything  i  i'm all mixed up and 
i tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you
i need another one sir
and who is she? does she work in catania?
yes she takes care of the garden
then it's impossible for her to know me in the villa where i'm at we have a male gardener
so? that's logical you see both being gardeners they spoke about you to one another
and what did they say about me?
they told me that you were a very nice girl that you always mind your business in other words things of that sort
no not like this one
and why wouldn't we have one like this?
because this is a chinese radio
but for you what comes first: music or love?
sorry but it's out of my hands try again next year
ah no for me love comes first i'm a man and i know what's what: first love and then music
unfortunately no
very well first of all i'll have them search the waters around the island i brought two frogmen with me meanwhile we'll take a look up around here
look marshal with those deep crevasses you'll need some rope and ladders
don't worry we've got everything
another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island
i know i know one thing at a time
and do you remember where she got off?
wellprobably at the last stop which is noto
there's the trinacria hotel or the regina near the municipal building as for rooming houses i don't know
no it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me if i push you have to let me back in dead hero father rule sir
thank you
don't mention it pleased to be of service any time
no the owners are in australia
but where did you come from?
from panarea why?
what boat?
just a moment ago didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
at this time of the year there are so many boats
and how come you're up so early?
early? is four in the morning early for you?
even if you graduate this academy you've still got nine months of probation that's hard duty son if you don't really love this job it'll kill you
anna is an excellent swimmer even with a cramp she would have managed to reach shore somehow
but you have to  consider all possibilities sandro
i don't see why i should mind
what do you want us to do? i don't know myself but we'll do something
i'll go and get my valise
good then i'll meet you there
yes we will
they didn't seem too good
you should have told ettore he always manages to get what he wants
ettore must be fed up with me by now
see you monday sir
oh no not at all and then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is
yes even i had a mother she was part austrian but she was still my mother my childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth here and there
lady patrizia
i detest it but after all what can you do it's the latestand i try my best to adapt myself
if women's breasts were colored yours would be blue
you know i don't love anybody
i know dammit i know  and just think  if there ever was a woman so right so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations degradations infidelities of  of of debaucheries it's her well anyway she's faithful faithful out of laziness of unwillingness
take it easy raimondo why are you getting so impatient?
claudia isn't coming with us will you please take care of her luggage? thanks
yes until proven otherwise
your dennis' kid  i work alone
i would like to ask you something
wait a moment can't you see i'm busy?
you're kidding
no i'm not why do you think she does all this? it's one of the many ways she can put herself on display when you bait the trap the mouse will snap to tell you the truth  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary well but you had something you wanted to ask me?
now listen if i had any information i wouldn't have come here to ask you but i see that you too lack any information 
is that possible?
who knows? another one has it that she entered a store in troina this information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought i don't know what in his store at troina
is that far from here?
about fifty miles or so if you want i'll give you the name of the storekeeper
yes of course but you should also print that in your paper but right away tomorrow morning it's the local palermo paper isn't it? i mean it's widely read
get used to me inspector i'm not going anywhere
yes but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? even if i sent it the editors wouldn't print it
you really must do me this one favor
pardon me but why must i do you a favor?
then let's call it a business proposition something to round out your salary
he talked to you himself?
no
through someone else?
yes
who?
i can't say
then go find a corner i don't want you in my way
why?
she'd punish me
one of the other sisters?
no
who?
oh for heaven's sake
i am there's too much flesh on me
agnes
i'm a blimp
why does it matter whether you're fat or not
i think we should get something straight here i was assigned to this office by the city
because
 you needn't worry about being attractive here
i do i have to be attractive to god
he loves you the way you are
no he doesn't he hates fat people
who told you this?
it's a sin to be fat
why?
look at the statues they're thin
agnes
what's your accomplishment
look i knew your father he had a helluva reputation on this job but that don't mean you get any slack swayzak sends you down here okay i gotta eat you that's the rules and i got nothing to say about that but swayzak or no you live with me step out of line and i don't care who knows you i'll swing the hammer  you think you're the first?
that's because they're suffering suffering is beautiful i want to be beautiful
who tells you these things?
christ said it in the bible he said  suffer the little children i want to suffer like a little child
that's not what he meant
i i am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon i i won't be able to fit in i i won't be able to squeeze into heaven
agnes dear heaven is not a place where
oh my dear child
god blew up the hindenburg he'll blow me up that's what she said
who?
mommy i'll get bigger and bigger every day and then i'll pop but but if i stay little it won't happen
pest control
your mother tells you this? agnes your mother is dead
but she watches she listens
nonsense i'm your mother now and i want you to eat
i'm not hungry
you've got to eat something agnes
no i don't the host is enough
my dear i don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything
of god
yes of god
why?
what are you listening to?
i don't know
dear jesus
yes mother
why?
in the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins
it made them holy
it made them uncomfortable and if they didn't sleep well i'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules sister where are your sheets?  do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
no
then tell me where are your sheets?
i burnt them
glass?
why?
they were stained
how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of
yes mother
say it
it's not that it's not that
what do you mean?
it's not my time of month
should you see a doctor?
i don't know i don't know what happened mother i woke up there was blood on the sheets but i don't know what happened  i don't know what i did wrong i don't know and i should be punished
do we have a language barrier here? glass
for what?
i don't know i don't know
that was the beginning the night of the conception that's why she burnt the sheets
yes
no i don't
i just heard you
that wasn't me
was it sister marguerite?
hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
let's talk about something else
 another backdraft
what would you like to talk about
i don't know
anything may i sit down?
yes
god  but there's nothing to say about god
second thing that comes to your mind
love
have you ever loved anyone?
yes
who?
no it couldn't
everyone
well who in particular?
right now?
uh huh
i love you
agnes have you ever loved another man other than jesus christ?
yes
who?
oh there are so many
well do you love do you love father martineau?
i just rewrote your contract c'mere
oh yes
do you think he loves you?
oh i know he does
he's told you?
no but when i look into his eyes i can tell
you've been alone together?
yes
often?
at least once a week
and you like that?
"trychtichlorate is a binary structured "
oh yes
where do you meet?
in the confessional
would you like to talk about it?
i never saw any baby i think they made it up
why should they?
i don't know
do you remember the night they said it came?
no i was sick
how were you sick?
 go to the bottom under heat properties
something i ate
did it hurt?
yes
where?
down there
and what did you do?
i went to my room
and what happened?
i got sicker
and then what?
i kill someone famous
"during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium"
i fell asleep
in the middle of all the pain?
yes
where did the baby come from?
what baby?
the baby they made up
from their heads
is that where they say it came from ?
no they say it came from the waste paper basket
where'd it come from before that?
ever burned magnesium? it's so hot it takes water molecules and bamm
from god
after god before the wastepaper basket
i i don't understand
agnes how are babies born?
don't you know?
yes i do  but i want you to
i don't understand what you're talking about you want to talk about the baby everybody wants to talk about the baby but i never saw the baby so i can't talk about the baby because i don't believe in the baby
then let's talk about something else
no no i'm tired of talking i've been talking for weeks nobody believes me when i tell them anything nobody listens to me
agnes
trychticholorate then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder
no no i don't want to answer any more questions
would you like to ask them?
what do you mean?
just that you ask and i'll answer
anything?
anything
martha louise livingston
are you married?
no
would you like to be?
and the putty around the door?
not at the moment no
do you have any children?
no
would you like some?
i can't have them any more
why not?
i've stopped menstruating
why do you smoke?
does it bother you?
no questions
even if it was used to seal the air off that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft a gun's a helluva lot easier
smoking is an obsession with me maybe one day i'll become obsessed with something else then i'll stop smoking do you have any more questions?
one
what?
from their mothers and fathers of course before that i i don't know
well i think they come from angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear that makes good babies start to grow and bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there and they start to grow grow till they come out down there i don't know where good babies come out and you can't tell the difference except bad babies cry a lot and they make their fathers go away and their mothers get very ill die sometimes
no do you?
why should i?
i don't know
she was kind to me she told me i was beautiful
what else did she tell you?
but the right guess on this is arson
she said all of god's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could i liked that
no only when she felt like it she brought me up here last winter and the next day she died
no wonder wait agnes agnes how do you feel about babies?
oh they frighten me i'm afraid i'll drop them they have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid i was dropped on my head that's why i don't understand things
like what?
numbers you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end
i don't understand them either do you suppose i was dropped on my head?
i hope not it's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head
oh i've got to give up smoking agnes  wait a minute agnes slow down
oh it's even more wonderful then
i don't guess
where did you go?
oh no place as wonderful as this agnes have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
no there is nothing else just being here at night helps me sleep
you have trouble sleeping?
i get headaches mommy did too oh but she wasn't stupid she knew things that nobody else knew
what things?
she knew what was going to happen to me that's why she hid me away
how did she know that?
somebody told her
who?
some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case
i don't know
agnes
you'll laugh
i promise i won't laugh who told her?
an angel when she was having one of her headaches
did your mother see angels often?
no
do you?
no
do you believe she really saw them?
i don't work for them either
no but i can never tell her that
why not?  mmm?
she'd get angry
yes
did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
i could never be a mother
why not?
well i don't think i'm old enough and besides i don't want to have a baby
why not?
because i don't want one
what?
if you did want one how'd you go about getting one?
from someone who didn't want to have a baby
like you?
a mistake
agnes how did your mother get you?
a mistake it was a mistake
is that what she said?
if you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true she was a good woman a saint 
agnes i don't believe you know nothing about sex
i can't help it if i'm stupid
then do it asshole
i got it after we talked to ronald torches want to fry the whole goddamn world but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much  the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls and he made his burns backdrafts 
 that you don't remember getting pregnant
not my fault
 and that you don't believe you carried a child
i was a mistake
what the child?
everything i don't have children
agnes
i'm not sick
but you're troubled aren't you?
that's because you keep reminding me if you go away then i'll forget
but he killed these guys
and you're unhappy
everyone's unhappy you're unhappy aren't you?
agnes
answer me  you never answer me
sometimes yes
only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me because i was bad not her
i'm always bad
what did you do?
i breathed
no
but he could have killed everybody there the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall the backdraft blew out the flame that's it that's the reason
you can tell me
i can't
she's dead isn't she?
yes
she can't hurt you any more
she can
how?

yes
i want you to remember if you can a night last january the night sister paul died do you remember

she'd seen him too
where?
from the belltower the day she before she died
so she sent you?
yes
yes
agnes agnes
did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report they did exactly one job  swayzak's manpower study it's not even really a company no employees no directors just a po box
agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of god he did a terrible thing to you do you understand?
no
he frightened you and he hurt you it's not your fault it's his fault tell us who he is so we can find him stop him from doing this to other women
not your fault
agnes who did you see?
i hate him
of course you do who was it?
i hate him for what he did to me
yes
for what he made me go through
then who wrote the report?
who?
i hate him
agnes who did this to you?
agnes you won't burn in hell it's alright to hate him
it was alive wasn't it?
i don't remember
yes
she took the baby in her arms?
yes
you saw it all didn't you?
it had to be someone who knows numbers some kind of fancy accountant but what's the connection?
yes
and then what did she do?  agnes what did she do?
she left me alone with that little thing and i looked at it and i thought this is a mistake but it's my mistake not mommy's god's mistake
i put her to sleep
h how?
i tied the cord around her neck wrapped her in the bloody sheets and stuffed her in the trash can
agnes?  who?  mother superior?
???
what?
look into the convent records
how ya feeling?
sister
martha all we're saying is noone wants this to come to trial not the church not the crown least of all me
eve she strangled a baby
nobody is interested in sending a nun to prison
no no excuse me eve as quickly as i see fit
the longer you take to make a decision the more difficult it will be for us
why?
the bishop is breathing down our necks
and the sooner she goes to prison the better off she'll be?
thanks
if you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck
yeah
marty what are you doing here?
larry there's got to be something missing
i gave you the pictures marty what else do you want?
something they that they overlooked
what?  you think that the girl is innocent?
i don't know
you got to be crazy
what's the matter with you you've seen the reports it's a cut and dried case
maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be
you're too involved marty  jesus look at you why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
did i say thanks?
if i find anything i'll call you
what about roger? he's free
look there are a lot of unanswered questions here
i don't believe this i don't bloody believe this
why?  you've done nothing to show any progress
yes that's because i'm getting to her
you're getting to all of us martha let's face it
i'll have a decision by next week
it's gone on long enough you're out
oh joe joe she didn't kill the baby
no
you have proof?
i'll have it
when?
next week
i can get you new evidence next week
no
tomorrow tomorrow i'll get it by tomorrow i will
shut up i'm trying to watch this
it's your favourite
who are you?
just wondering
it's martha mama  there you go
marie brings me icecream too you know chocolate my favourite
i thought cherryvanilla was your favourite
not any more now i like chocolate
did you have a good week mama are they treating you all right?
you know martha never comes to see me you watch it she's going straight to hell after all the things she said to me then she marries that son of a bitch of a frenchman has an abortion i knew that one wouldn't work out not like you marie you got married to god
marie's dead mama
i remember when you was a little girl marie you come back from the movies and you'd say  mama that ending was so sad and i'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in hollywood  and you believed me
mama that wasn't marie that was me
who are you?
i hate hospitals you're so so goddamn useless
i i'm martha mama
how do you survive?
oh we own the land around here but we rent it out we keep a few acres for ourselves  some wheat corn some vegetables
well that's a lot of land you must have help do you have field hands that help you?
no we work the land alone noone but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public
sister anne which was agnes' room?
the one up on the third floor?
yes
uh huh
well you're probably right about that it certainly can't help sister agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time
i've been lying here hours just thinking we're close  we're not looking in the right place brian this one knows us and we're not looking in the right place
why do you call it an investigation? i never have
your mother was a resident of saint catherines home before you moved her
what does this have to do with?
who told you this?
do you still go to church?
what business is it of yours?
oh we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case
look father ah just because i don't subscribe to the to the beliefs you subscribe to
but what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever doctor but it does make all the difference to agnes
i don't understand are you expecting me to?
yeah
well somone's got to suffer for this doctor you've got to be merciful and quick excuse me
yes i
you can call me sister
 thank you
you must have tons of questions you may smoke if you want to just don't tell any of the sisters
two packs a day
i can beat that
unfiltered
noone
how did she hide it from the other nuns?
another couple of good men get burned up for their city? is that how it's going to read?  you're the only one that knows
she undressed alone she bathed alone
is that normal?
yes
how did she hide it during the day?
she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to
didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
we're examined once a year her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits
who was the father?
i haven't a clue
what man had access to her?
like it never happened
none as far as i know
was there a priest?
yes but i
what's his name?
father martineau but i don't see him as a candidate
could there have been anyone else?
obviously there was
and you didn't try to find out who?
believe me i've done everything possible short of asking agnes
why haven't you asked her?
hi helen man you look great
look someone gave her the baby
yes but that was some ten months ago i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial
why do you think that?
don't ask me those questions dear i'm not the patient
well i'm the doctor i'm the one who's going to decide what is or is not important here
look doctor i don't know how to tell you this politely but i don't approve of you not you personally
the science of psychiatry
exactly i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible she won't hold up under any sort of cross examination
i am not with the inquisition
and i am not from the middle ages i know what you are  i don't want that mind cut open
smarter than americans  you're fed cry baby talk shows all day long  not only will americans believe me they'll cry for me  sodetective eddie flemming would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette? maybe you can propose to her now?
you look like brian
what's your opinion?
i believe agnes is different
from other nuns  yes i i've noticed
from other people  i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying
how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
because she's an innocent she's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by god
that's ridiculous
in her case it isn't she's had very little schooling her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us she's never been out there doctor she's never seen a movie or a television show she's never even read a book
if she's so innocent how come she murdered a child?
she didn't  this is manslaughter not murder she didn't consciously kill that baby she'd lost a lot of blood she was unconscious by the time we got to her
four months
so someone else could have done it
no not in the eyes of the police
and in your eyes?
i've already told you what i thought
that she was unconscious yes  so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the
you don't really believe something like that happened do you?
it's possible isn't it?
who?
one of the other nuns found out about the baby and and wanted to avoid a scandal
that possibility never occurred to you?
four months?
noone knew about agnes' pregnancy noone not even agnes
well it's been known to happen in the day too maybe agnes went to him
oh come on you've talked to her she doesn't even know how babies are born let alone made
when did you first learn about her innocence the way she thinks?
shortly after she came to us
and you weren't shocked?
i was appalled just as you are now
and what happened?
she stopped eating completely
about two years before
i know i know should'a called i've been really busy i joined the fire department
it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again
she had a a hole in the palm of her hand  she could have bled to death
but she didn't did she if anyone had seen what i'd seen she'd be public property newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule she doesn't deserve that
she has it now
i know what you're thinking she's a hysteric pure and simple
not simple no
i saw it clean through the palm of her hand do you think hysteria could do that?
it's being doing it for centuries she's not unique she's just another victim
god's victim that's her innocence she belongs to god
and i intend to take her away from him that's what you're afraid of isn't it?
yeah you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid
what?
nuns you hate nuns
i hate ignorance and stupidity
the catholic church
i haven't said anything against the the catholic church
catholicism is not on trial here i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else
how dare you tell me to run my affairs
how dare you think i'm in a position to be pressured
 or bullied or what ever you're doing who the hell do you think you are?  you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child
and she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in god   and aren't any worse off than you mother people who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody and people who fall in love and have babies and occas sionally are very happy she has a right to know that but you and your your order and your church have kept her ignorant
sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle?
???    virginity right mother?  poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by
i am not a virgin doctor i was married for twenty three years two daughters i even have grandchildren surprised? it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother my children won't even see me any more that's their revenge i think they tell their friends that i've passed on and don't tell me i'm making up for past mistakes doctor freud 
then help her
i am
no you're shielding her let her face the world
what good would it do no matter what you decide it's either the the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin
there's another choice
what?
aquittal
how?
stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident
innocence legal innocence i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court
answers
oh some time in january
do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
earthquakes?
visitors to the convent
nothing
do you have a a diary or a day book?
yes
take at look at it
stephen's not staying here now brian he moved out last april
was the child full term?
oh dear god
what is it?
the sheets
what sheets?
oh dear god i should have guessed
the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away
sister paul?
yes i don't remember where agnes was i was needed in the sick room
about what?
you guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile
your niece
i didn't tell you because i didn't think it was important
no it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent my sister ran away from home we lost touch with her and when my husband died and i came here she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened
and agnes' father?
yes
listening to angels?
she drank too much that's what killed her
do you know what she did to her?
i don't think i care to know
and i'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman brian
she molested her
oh dear god
there is more here than meets the eye isn't there?  lots of dirty little secrets
oh god if only i'd known
why didn't you?  you knew she was keeping her home from school you knew she was an alcoholic
i knew that after the fact
why didn't you do anything to stop her?
because i didn't know 
oh god
i'd like yours too
we don't know that yet  it's much too early  there's a lot to be done
uh i think there's been a mistake i didn't save that woman
don't deny it
i haven't decided yet
the woman's health is at stake
her spiritual health
i don't give a damn about her spiritual health
i know you don't
she's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone
then why did you call the police in the first place mother huh?
bullshit
bullshit yourself
no need to be modest brian
catholic church doesn't have a corner on morality
who said anything about the catholic church
you just said
what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you?
nothing
what have we done to hurt you?  and don't deny it i can smell an excatholic a mile away what did we do?  burn a few heretics sell some indulgences? that was in the days when the church was a ruling body we let governments do those things today so what did we do to you eh?  you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
stupid woman and that's all?
that's all?  that's enough  she was a beautiful little girl
and what has that to do with it?
i wasn't i wasn't she was the pretty one she died why not me?  i never said my morning prayers and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me polkadot livingston
no you don't understand i saved a mannequin
so you left the church because you had freckles?
no because i yeah yeah i left the church cause i had freckles
no it reminds me
would you like one?  huh?
i'd love one
all right?
fine thanks
do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
undoubtedly not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more
long thin and filtered
 that really was incredibly work you did you and your brother fighting fires together helluva image isn't it? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command
saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet  and of course 
hand rolled
even christ would partake socially
saint peter?
pipe
right
mary magdelen?
oh you've come a long way baby
and saint john would chew tobacco
there are no saints today good people yes but extraordinarily good people those i'm afraid we are sorely lacking
every little boy's fantasy
do you think they ever existed?
yes i do
do you want to become one?
become?  one is born a saint
well you can try can't you to be good?
yes but goodness has very little to do with it not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy but they were still attached to god agnes has that birth  no more we're born we live we die no room for miracles  oh my dear how i miss the miracles
listen to her singing
i'd like to begin
begin what?
the hypnotism do you still disapprove?
brian let me come to the point i'd like to offer you a job
would it stop you if i did?
no
of course
then let's begin
no no i said leave her alone
you're what?
if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes we'll find our own thank you 
one that will ask the questions you want asked
one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect
for the church?
i have a job
for agnes
you think she's a saint?
she's been touched by god yes
how?  how?  she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched give me a miracle
the father
who is he?
why must he be anybody?
my god you're as crazy as
stop laughing i don't say it's the truth i'm saying
how  ?
this one's still with the fire department one of our best investigators don rimgale is working on a very difficult visible case right now we think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us: an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan
don't be ridiculous
well give me a reasonable explanation
a miracle is an event without an explanation if she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
this is insane
there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out
you're saying god did it?
you'll never find the answer for everything god did
i thought you didn't believe in miracles today mother?
but i want the opportunity to believe i want the choice to believe
but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped or seduced or that she did the seducing
yeah we got all kinds of traditions  like dying young
she is an innocent
but she is not an enigma mother everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry one two three right down the line
that's what you believe she is?  the sum of her psychological parts?
that's what i have to believe
then why are you so obsessed with her? you're losing sleep over her?  you're thinking about her all the time you're bent on saving her why?
that's crazy how could she find out about it?
somebody told her
who?  that tun that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years
oh would you stop lying mother
why would i lie?
not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone brian this could be a great opportunity to move beyond a fire engine
because it's murder we're talking about aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room
i'm concerned about her health
who was that person mother?  was it you?
if you believe this is murder it is the crown attorney you have to talk to not me and definitely not agnes
where is she?
hasn't she had enough?
i have a few more questions to ask her
my god but you're determined
why do you insist upon pressing
was it you?
you did what?
how many victims are up there?
nice boat
is it because she's a nun?
did you know she was pregnant?
yes
and you didn't send her to a doctor
i didn't guess until it was too late
for what?  an abortion?
oh don't be ridiculous
too late for what?
i don't know too late to stop it
the baby?
it isn't mine  let's get a picture
the scandal
you went to the room to help with the birth
she didn't want any help
you wanted that child out of the way
that's a lie
you hid the wastepaper basket in her room
i didn't hide it i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets
and the baby
no
you tied the cord around its neck
yeah in fact i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office they loved it and you know what? you were right my family background in firefighting gave it weight
i wanted her to have it when noone else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked
before or after you killed the child?
i left it with her and i went for help
i doubt that's what she'd say
then she's a liar
agnes what happened to the baby?
she can't remember
what happened to the baby?
wasn't it
yes they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of liverpool scruffy young lads lacking even the price of a jam roll orphans every paddy's son of 'em i saw their potential at once although i had me doubts about the little fella a savage primitive that ringo but it was him what gave in first he picked up a brick and heaved it at me and i quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes "mister can you spare us a copper?" he said i was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler  so i took them under me managerial banner
what the hell are we waiting for?
the usual ten per cent?
oh not at all i let them have twentyfive; sure aren't there four of them?
how fascinating do go on    john
 oh i'm all heart ma'am all heart  well i let 
eh?

they'll be here
oh now they can't do that to me  it's all your fault  oh yes it is and if they don't turn up i wouldn't be in your shoes for all the
aren't you supposed to be in that box?
oh surely one can have a tiny touch
if you so much as breathe heavy on them i'm out on strike
aren't you being rather arbitrary?
ah man if you're gonna bribe your way into a station why not 17 with me and your brother?
that's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches i don't go round messing about with your earphones do i?
spoil sport
well
well that's the wrong line for a start

you've got an inferiority complex you have
yeah i know that's why i took up the drums it's me active compensatory factor
no she'll only reject me in the end and i'll be frustrated
you never know you might be lucky this time
no i know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins

i wouldn't be seen dead in them they're dead grotty
grotty?
yeah grotesque
make a note of that word and give it to susan i think it's rather touching really here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things of course they're grotty you wretched nit that's why they were designed but that's what you'll want
but i won't
you can be replaced you know chicky baby
i don't care
and that pose is out too sunny jim the new thing is to care passionately and be right wing anyway you won't meet susan if you don't cooperate
and who's this susan when she's at home?
"probationary fireman brian mccaffrey on his very first fire showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to doublecheck a burning floor alone emerging victoriously with anna rodriguez a seamstress for the north shore clothing company mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 pulitzer prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death"
only susan campey our resident teenager you'll have to love her she's your symbol
oh you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
i beg your pardon?
oh yes the lads frequently gather round the tv set to watch her for a giggle once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish
she's a trend setter it's her profession
she's a drag a wellknown drag we turn the sound down on her and say rude things
get him out of here
have i said something amiss?
get him out of here he's knocking the programme's image
it is y'know
there's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts if that's what you mean if someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed
but your grandfather lives in your house i've seen him
oh that's me other grandfather but this one's me grandfather and all
a butcher?
yeah she was fickle
no straight up
i suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it

swayzak's not my boss
ah well eh look

i'll look in here again

i'm warning you they'll be back in a minute
d'you know something "they" don't worry me at all anyroad i only fancy listening to you  that's all but if it worries you  well 
you're from liverpool aren't you?
how'd you guess?
oh it's the way you talk
is it  is it really?
are you pulling my leg?
something like that
management were pin heads
i see  do you like the play?
yeah  i mean sure well i took it at school but i only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines like sounds different on a girl  yeah it's gear on a girl
gear?
aye the big hammer smashing
thank you
don't mench  well why don't you give us a few more lines like?
i'm not 
oh you're the understudy sort of thing?
no  i'm a walkon in a fancy dress scene i just felt like doing those lines
oh i see you are an actress though aren't you?
can we go up to the crime scene?
"laguna jamming custom surfboards"?
yes
aye i knew you were
what's that mean?
well the way you were spouting like   "i don't believe you sir" and all that yeah it was gear
the big hammer?
oh aye a sledge
but the way you did it then sounded so phony
no  i wouldn't say that  just like an actress  you know
aye well actresses aren't like real people are they?
they ought to be
coffee sucked
oh i don't know anyroad up they never are are they?
what are you?
i'm in a group  well  there are four of us we play and sing
i bet you don't sound like real people
we do you know we sound like us having a ball it's fab
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
what of? look i wouldn't do it unless i was i'm dead lucky 'cos i get paid for doing something i love doing
i only enjoy acting for myself i hate it when other people are let in
why? i mean which are you scared or selfish?
why selfish?
and just this year "brian's sound spectrum" your own company even big step
well you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee
not really but i'm probably not a toffee maker how would you do those lines of mine?
well look at it this way i mean when you come right down to it that girl she's a bit of a scrubber isn't she?
is she?
of course  look if she was a liverpool scrubber   eh fella you want to try pulling the other one it's got a full set of bells hanging off it  y'what?  i know your sort two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway you're just after me body and y'can't have it  so there
and you honestly think that's what she meant?
oh definitely it sticks out a mile she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want  well  i don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married but girls are like that clever and cunning you've got to laugh
and cunning
and what do you do about it?
me? oh i don't have the time i'm always running about with the lads  no we don't have the time
i was ahead of my time
pity
aye it is but as long as you get by it's all right you know  bash on happy valley's when they let you stop anyroad i'd better get back
yes
see you
of course
quite right invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar disgusting
well  what's the matter with that?
have you no natural resources of your own? have they even robbed you of that?
you can learn from books
can you now? aah  sheeps' heads you learn more by getting out there and living
you know i've got a perfect little spot here for "brian mccaffrey fireman"
out where?
any old where  but not our little richard  oh no when you're not thumping them pagan skins you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish
books are good
parading's better
parading?
that's it parading the streets  trailing your coat  bowling along  living
well i <u>am</u> living aren't i?
you're living are you? when was the last time you gave a girl a pinkedged daisy? when did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
eh  you're a bit old for that sort of chat aren't you?
at least i've a backlog of memories but all you've got is that book
brian he's not doing it right dad he never does it right
aaah  stop picking on me you're as bad as the rest of them
so you <u>are</u> a man after all
what's that mean?
do you think i haven't noticed  do you think i wasn't aware of the drift? oh  you poor unfortunate scuff they've driven you into books by their cruel unnatural treatment exploiting your good nature
oh  i dunno
and that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you  and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat i'd like to know
yeah  that's right
and what's it all come to in the end?
yeah  what's in it for me?
a book
well let's have a look
yeah  a bloomin' book
yeah  funny really 'cos i'd never thought of it but being middleaged and old takes up most of your time doesn't it?
you're only right
i'm not wrong
i'm going parading before it's too late
well i'm not exactly a voluntary patient
shush have they roughed you up yet?
what?
keep your voice down this lot'll paste you just for the exercise oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you

oh anything you say paul
i've got a little list here wandering abroad malicious intent acting in a suspicious manner conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace you name it he's done it
oh a little savage is he?
a proper aborigine
yeah but he insisted on us bringing him to the station
well he can't stop here
is that you roby?
i feel like shit
yeah it's you all right
stephen you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this
cattle ranch
i'm not kidding  you can get one if you have the credit  look just like real cows too
hell we're equipped 
hell no  we don't know what's down there on that piece of rock  it might be dangerous  what we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities and let them deal with it
kill drive engines
nine hundred meters and dropping 800  700  hang on gentlemen
or something will be able to see us
not sitting on our butts in here that's for sure
not exactly just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years
 i don't know
i just wanted to i don't know not exactly apologize for the other night  especially since i don't remember much of it 
do you remember the pyramid?
no  just some horrible dreams about smothering  where are we?
sandy scan the whole sky
dell plot our location
where the hell are we?
just short of zeta ii reticuli  we haven't even reached the outer rim yet
that's what i'm going to do
yeah  two hours
gravity?
point eight six  we can walk on it
 you remember
there are no commercial lanes out here  face it we're out of range
i'll see what i can do
activated  vertical drop checked correcting course  on tangential course now orbiting  crossing the terminator  entering night side
what's the terrain down there?
well line of sight is impossible due to dust  radar gives me noise sonar gives me noise  infrared  noise  let's try ultraviolet  there flat  it's totally flat  a plain
is it solid?
it's basalt  rock
then take her down
drop begins now  fifteen kilometers and dropping twelve ten eight and slowing  five three  two  one kilometer and slowing  lock tractor beams
martin would you run me an atmospheric?
we don't know  when i have more i'll let you know
yeah i just thought i should say i don't know something
receiving
looks like a derelict
martin we're going in  i'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on
no you'll follow me
but functioning
chaz this is dell  can you come topside for a minute?
what's up?
well the sun just came up again and it seems the wind's died down it's as clear as a bell outside there's something i think you ought to see
i'm on my way
take a look
the great communicator
what is it i can't 
you want to try?
sure
no it's too small only room enough for one person
can you see anything in the hole?
no i want to go in
take care
yeah i'm okay  haven't hit bottom yet  definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust
what was that dell i lost you do you read me?
yeah but this is hard work  can't talk now
sorry i hit jackson
wretched  what happened to me?
don't you remember?
don't remember nothing  can't hardly remember my name
god i'm hungry
i think that's a pretty reasonable request
i don't know i'm getting these <u>cramps</u>
<u>oh god it hurts so bad</u>
i have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin
a transmission?
a voice transmission
he deserved it he was born deserving it
play it for us please
unknown
yes  there are two points of salient interest  number one: it is highly systematized indicating intelligent origin  number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate
what?  <u>why</u>?
i am programmed to do so if certain conditions arise
it is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man
i have a temporary sequence on the monitor 
hold it i can't hear a damn thing
the reaction has proceeded too far the core has begun to melt  engines will overload in 2 minutes 35 seconds
has the hull been breached?
he treats you okay?
hard to say
well get started
right  talk to you
yeah
how's it coming on the engines?
what?
not <u>they</u> <u>he</u>
yeah okay  go ahead
jay we've got a problem  i was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability
why what's wrong?
okay
the computer's translated the alien signal and it's kind of alarming
what do you mean?
it couldn't translate the whole thing only three phrases  i'll just read it to you the way i got it:  " hostile survival advise do not land "  and that's all it could translate
it grows on you
you know what they make this stuff out of?
yes i know what they make it out of so what?  it's food now  <u>you're</u> eating it
i didn't say it was bad for you it's just kind of sickening that's all
shit
we have to avoid injuring it  what we really need is some electric animal prods
machine's screwed up i can't tell needle's spinning all over the dial
i treated you better
that way
bulbs burned out nobody bothered to replace 'em
all over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure
dead
dead
it's monstrous  it grew like some horrible tapeworm  we were completely unprepared
it's still in the ship?
don't know  broussard got hurt somehow
hurt  how?
don't know  maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck  i knew we shouldn't of come down here
you treated me like shit
is it alive?
well we should at least be able to each buy our own planet
what was that?  what the christ was that?
the water will still recycle
 and the cooling unit on the other
right
damn it  how long to fix?
well i'm going to have to blow the engines out
and when will you be ready to do that?
oh  i'm not near ready yet
coffee? nah i gotta go
then why the hell are you sitting around here?
right
here let me try
what?
the engines are fixed
just hold us together till we're in space that's all
i kind of like it
we could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship  that would kill it
no we can't afford to lose that much oxygen  we're going to have to flush it out
i hope not
what's wrong stephen?  c'mon you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind  how's brian doing?
all right  roby and melkonis will go with faust  hunter and i will make up the second team
well we better do something
poison gas
meet us on the bridge  be careful  it's <u>huge</u> now
right
no i don't want us separated
you just sealed it off; it can't get to that section
right 
and be right back
yeah well maybe he should have  i mean you brought the goddamn thing in here  maybe <u>you</u> deserve to get slapped
i can't talk right now  we have some things to take care of
he's out
<u>he's</u> the only one that knows that
how does he breathe?
yeah but how?  his nose and mouth are blocked
well can't we kill it?  i mean we can't leave the damn thing on him
we don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it  at least right now it's keeping him alive
how about cutting it off?  we can't pull it loose but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer where it's stuck to his face
it's eating a hole in the floor
but this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>
hell of a defense mechanism  you don't dare kill it
isn't there some way we can get it off him?
i know he's out but how's he doing?
you can't tell  that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits
we'd be sitting ducks in the freezers
boy that's terrific
well how does it feel to be rich men?
it wouldn't come
ask him
careful don't get under it
i'll come with you
what do you mean?
well those things out there aren't the same you know  the spaceship and the pyramid  they're from different cultures and different races  that ship just landed here  crashed like we did  the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous
y'know i treated him better than any other probie i ever had he probably hates my guts but i did the best thing for him i made him finally look in the mirror
how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  it's dead
maybe it wasn't always dead
the door was closed  it must still be in here
well what the hell good can we do in here?  we can't grab it  it might jump on us 
maybe we can catch it
how's broussard?
he's running a fever
still unconscious?
yes
can you do anything for him?
ah stephen that's what this is really about isn't it? you always have to be right
the machine will bring his temperature down  his vital functions are strong
good
good  get on it  but first i'm issuing a standing order: from this moment forth every one of us will wear protective garments including helmets  let's get down to the locker and change
how do we locate the creature?
don't be an idiot
the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out
sounds like a rough one
got a better idea?
at least it can't get up here now
that's right  we can't kill it on the ship but we can at least keep it at bay  and maybe drive it into the air lock
hey i'm the first one to admit when i'm wrong
thing is i'm about out of fuel
oh my god
does anybody know what happened?
i don't buy that  there's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers
<u>how</u>?
it's time for drastic remedies
good  that's good
we can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely once the lifeboat is in space
the flamethrower needs more fuel
right  we've got a lot to accomplish  let's get moving
yeah? when was the last time?
should we go outside and bring him in?
no the risk is too great  perhaps after we've destroyed the thing
what we really need is some red meat in here for bait
whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full  i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside and to serve as as 
let me go first; you stay behind me
i can't the acid will pour out
i've completely lost their signal
can you get them back?
i'm trying
the computer just translated the goddamn message  it's not an sos it was a warning
in a fire? never  look i'm his brother i care about him y'know? he was going to get himself killed maybe not today maybe not in a year but it would've happened and i couldn't  i just couldn't
no
what do you mean no?
we're not going anywhere
but they don't know about the translation  they could be in danger right now
we can't spare the personnel  we've got minimum takeoff capability right now  that's why chaz left us on board
why you chickenshit bastard 
just can that crap  i'm in command here till chaz returns  and nobody's leaving this ship
how many?
three blips  they're coming this way
jay this is cleave  meet me at the main air lock
you can't keep being his father
i guess i had it coming  let's call it settled
what is it  i can't tell anything 
it's some kind of organ  it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat
oh god
it doesn't make any sense  it paralyzes him puts him into a coma then keeps him alive
i think it's fizzled out
hey  what about the film?
the same thing must've happened to the creatures on the other ship except they took one of those jars on board and opened it there
listen hadn't somebody better check on broussard?
it was horrible  horrible  like a chicken
what's wrong?
we sure need this flamethrower
in symbolic form very stylized but if you stare at it you can see some of the different creatures we've been dealing with
well i suppose that starshaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard  is that what you mean?
and right next to it that oval design with the markings  it's a dead ringer for the spore casings
you will notice though that there are no more phases  only four forms are shown  after that the pattern repeats
i've got an idea but you're not going to like it
and the creature with it  we can make it back to irth in the lifeboat
our lives are more important anyway we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat
we can use the flamethrower
it's not going to work
i  it used to be when i was a kid what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs life and death right and wrong when someone called the fire department we came those guys don't know how much i love them you don't leave people hanging cause that's what it's all about it's loyalty it's 'till death do us part isn't that what you heard? it's you go we go cause without that it's the end of families it's the end of the fire department and when the fire department stops coming that's the end of the fucking world  i'm sorry i came helen it's just it's just there's nobody i can talk to  i miss you
i should hope so  and we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it
hey look somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat
is it armed?
if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off
thanks for the thought 
feast your eyes
sandy can you home in on that beam?
what's the frequency?
computer what's the frequency of the transmission?
dell  show me that on a screen
i really can't give out any information right now at this point
stephen i can i talk to you a second
well this rock rotates every two hours  the sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes
sorry  nothing but that same damn transmission every 32 seconds  i've tried every frequency on the spectrum
all right  now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless i say otherwise  martin do you read me?
you lead
my signal's fading
how far?
we should be almost on top of it  i just can't quite
who knows?
that creature sure must have considered it important using his last strength to draw it
can't tell  these weather conditions could erode anything fast
 no that's okay it's just sean
i couldn't make it out  too much interference
sun will be down in a minute
it'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it  the line could get tangled in something
but what can we do?  he's out of radio contact
maybe we should just wait a few more minutes
is it still coming up or is it hooked on something?
no it's coming
can you see anything?
<u>don't touch him watch it</u>
help me  i'm going to try to get it off
 he's gettin' good on those eggs and y'know he told me he actually likes the piano
what is it?
how the hell should i know?  come on give me a hand let's get him out of there
let's let the machine work on him
yes thank heaven
we're just plain lucky  that could have gone right through the hull  taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it
reminded me of when i was a kid and the roof leaked  everybody running for the pots and pans
is it still dripping?
it appears to have healed itself
primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment and this can be used as a starting point for translation
they're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb  god knows how long they've been here
i don't want to confuse him stephen
we're going into the freezers now
the commander normally has first publication rights
maybe we could write it together
well i kind of hate to point it out but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation and as you know we used up most of that time in harvesting
we've got about a week left right?
room by room corridor by corridor
we'll have to trap it somehow  if we had a really strong piece of net we could bag it
i was thinking of a line from an old poem: "water water everywhere but not a drop to drink"  all that space out there and we're trapped in this ship
that's the one about the albatross right?
we can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust  we are utterly absolutely alone  can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  halfway across creation
putty? on both doors?
we came out there we'll go back  a long time by the clock but a short time to us
time and space have no meaning out here  we're living in einsteinian equation
i can see you're putting your spare time to good use  let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough they'll be peeling you off a wall  i've seen it happen
we're the new pioneers chaz  we even have our own special diseases
come on  let's go above and see how they're coming with the gear
are they close?
they're on the next level up
let's get moving with this net
all right then  when it gets to the other side of the door you sing out then drop the door  okay?
okay
there's something else kinda interesting
and you and i will bag it and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock got it?
look 
just a second  those aren't water vapor clouds; they have no moisture content
close
that tube must be depositing it in him
could be some kind of venom or poison
about four hours
yeah?
they never made it off the planet the parasites won
couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
mccaffrey hold this for us
what's the matter you don't like this stuff?
tastes like something you'd feed a chicken to make it lay more eggs
right  fire up all systems
sandy contact traffic control
chaz i've got something here on my security alert  a high priority from the computer
let's hear it
computer you have signalled a priority three message  what is the message?
well it's finally happened
no  that's atmosphere  cloud layer
turn on navigation lights
trychticholorate? alright it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents it's pretty rare they stopped making it a couple'a years ago
engine room what happened?
sandy how far are we from the source of the transmission?
nontoxic but unbreathable pressure?
ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter
good  moisture content?
zero  dry as a bone
any microorganisms?
not a one  it's dead
anything else?
yeah rock particles  dust
probably got in cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire
well we won't need pressure suits but breathing masks are called for sandy  can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
good  i'm getting you clear too let's just keep the line open
found what?
it appears to be some sort of spacecraft  we're going to approach it
i agree  this is the single most important discovery in history
but?
what killed it?
i don't even know what i'm looking for
still worried?
oh well you know me
what the hell was it doing in the fire?
i've always respected your opinion martin  if something worries you it worries me
well it's obviously intentional some kind of attempt at communication maybe it's a symbol that means something to them
but why draw it on the wall?
tell you what martin  as soon as the engine's fixed 
yeah we hear you  we're coming back
thank christ  we lost you  listen there's been a new development 
can't talk now; broussard's injured we'll need some help getting him into the ship
we're coming up now open the outer lock door
chaz  what happened to broussard?
it's some kind of organism it's attached itself to him  let us in
okay  but i do understand that your partner leon jackson's been injured is that correct?
that's your job
chaz if it's an organism and we let it in the ship will be infected
we can't leave him out here open the door
chaz listen to me  we've broken every rule of quarantine  if we bring an organism on board we won't have a single layer of defense left
martin this is an order  open the door
good
he went into the pyramid alone  we lost radio contact with him  when we pulled him out it was on his face it won't come off not without injuring him
broussard had film in his datastick didn't he?  we can see what happened to him
is that its mouth?
look i'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything  the important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible
i can't lean on faust any harder  he's been working nonstop on the engines
how ya doin' ronald staying comfortable?
if we knew exactly what happened to the beings on the other ship 
they seem native to the planet  it's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity  it's dead now but once it must have been fertile
up one kilometer jay
let's take her into an escape orbit
you bet we made it  martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive
with great pleasure
quit complaining; we're in space
we'll have to go into quarantine maybe for quite a while
that's okay he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him
all right so that's what we've got a week  it's plenty of time
didn't think you'd make it
but if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week then we have to go into the freezers anyway
even simple
we've got it up here  it's trapped get up here fast
where are you?
foodstorage room
we're coming
it started crashing around right after we locked it in
now what?
i guess we open the door and net it
once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more  we can go straight into hypersleep  also it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all
wouldn't miss this for the world pal
you win
go ahead jay
what do you think?  now we go in
the man would need protection obviously  as well as some way to drive the thing before him
let's be democratic
right now let's keep it closed
by eating our food supplies
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing
well yes there's a pattern but it's meaningless to me
who's this?
i know it looks like a senseless jumble but if you look closely there are recognizable forms
so the next step should be 
then that tomb must have been some kind of fertility temple where they stored their eggs and maybe held mating rituals
 more spores coming
can we get to him?
no i had to seal off a whole section  we'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door
at least we're rid of the damn monster  it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship
no such luck  i saw it running down one of the corridors
that kind of remark is pointless now come on  i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with no matter how wild
okay  first we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines
he works for me
that'll blow the ship up
right but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core  in the meantime we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship
doesn't matter  we're already at light speed  and when we get back to the colonies they'll pick us up in the network
yeah i forgot
but the idea's good if we could just turn it around somehow
here carry these
it's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it
now  if we can get it into the boat we won't have to blow it up  we can just eject it into space
who gets the privilege?
and you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way
is he a fireman?  i like firemen
and you stand aside while we drive it in then shut the hatch launch the boat and 
kablooey
what did it do to you?
look
i'll get you out of there
no don't
but i can save you  get you to the autodoc
no good it's eaten too much of me
what can i do?
kill me
you like everybody ronald
the head's okay but i could sink a sixpack
forget that  i want you off alcohol for at least seventytwo hours i've got some toxin buildup tests still to run
sure
it's nothing doc  just a touch of indigestion something
do you want a tablet?
yeah
do you wanna head back and call it in?
well just keep looking  it's gotta be whoa jesus
is it dead?
no it's still breathing  kinda clammy though  are you sure your stick's not broken
i know you
god i hope that thing didn't bring down a virus
i told you we what's that?
bloody big if it is  top's open
wait a minute
thanks
good argument for guncontrol  what are you going after rhino?
nah  i just wanna squeeze off a few rounds  'sides they tagged the rhinos for the migration project so they're protected  they'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it
oh man
yep
better tell the boss
tell him about me shadow?
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a backtrace just to make sure
yeah  turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace
okay give me the numbers
a threesecond burn to port on my mark
it's on the board
what's happening?
cassie thank christ  we're under attack
we're what?
too many
we're not gonna make it are we?
he was hurt but not seriously  he'll be fine
ronald here likes telephones used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton came up with a whole little thing there didn't you ronald? when you got bored what did you do? you just started making calls mostly day care centers and retirement homes wasn't it?
what?  what's wrong?  what is it?
comin' up the central reservoir
quick  run a trace on the culvert leading off the autoshop maintenance pit
and?
drains right into the central reservoir
get her online  now
keep trying
shit  when?
yesterday  we got the network feed from gateway; it was the top story on 'sixty seconds'  biggest market crash since twentyfour
you win some you loose some
did he tell you how we finally met?
i lose 'em all that's why i'm still out here on this rock  anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
no but i got something that might interest you
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles
we ran a trajectory simulation  if they carry on along that path it's possible they'll make intraorbital insertion
seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour  those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort
can we move it to a different orbit in time?
match it
the door's sealed from inside  doc revna's in there and it sounds like ackland's going nuts
force the door
nooooo
nobody cares ronald
what's our weapons situation?
has anybody talked to them?
not yet
do it
alright let's keep calm  we've got to have an option of some sort there's got to be a way out of this
about thirty minutes  those are slimmeddown tanks so no stopping to admire the scenery
deal
we've dumped the whole database from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet it'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go
but
one more sweep one more sweep  i'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep we're been lookin' for this thing for three days now and found zip
oh but it's a good story shadow you're depriving our famous young friend here
ah quit griping  keeps you in shape doesn't it?
hey  i was in shape before we started doing this
that's what i mean  this is the quietest i've ever heard it  it's unnatural
yeah?
next time you have a thought like that? keep it to yourself
i dunno
what?
take a look at this
that's impossible man  this fence is hightensile  the breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino easy i know i put it up
goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies
absolutely
that's a fact
what?
just got a reading
i've seen this mother de vries  we can bag it no problem
forget it man
c'mon de vries  think of the bonus
fuck the bonus  i hate heights  you wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night
hey fair enough  if you won't come i'll handle it myself
what?
i'll come with you
and old ladies?
anything you say mammacitta
yeah i got it
it's moving slow  about eleven metres on the left
what's wrong?
i'm picking up another signal
just behind us over to the right
yeah i
how?
i dunno  might be a glitch
it's alright it's cool
 burn them
is it still moving?
no he's stopped; he's totally still just take it nice and easy babe nice and easy
couple more seconds
thanks
york just turned up outside  we're trying to get him into infirmary
where does that lead to?
okay
one final point  killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself  however just to add a little incentive i'm authorizing a hefty bonus in the next paypacket for whoever does
autoshop?
nah  it's got programmable facilities but it was never rigged for remote operation  someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running
and the world  the whole world
which mean physically going outside
uhhuh
sounds great
how tight are these shafts?
what's the problem?
she was running a little sluggish on the way back  think the turbines might be playing up
give me twenty minutes and i'll do it myself
appreciate that
and nothing  they checked out just fine
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to crossreff them through?
 burn it all
done it already  nothing matches
just give them the facts  they can leap to their own conclusions
get off an allbands emergency distress and put it on a repeater
compensate
punch me in a solution for their deltavee
what is that?
you've checked that end?
how many how many people are missing?
looks like it
well try the headset
are the glory boys actually showing interest in investigation's work? i may have a stroke
what?  why?
forget it  i wouldn't ask somebody to do something i wouldn't do myself  where's the disk?
let's just run through it one more time so i know you've got it straight
okay i pull the access panel off of the console  insert the disk and press the green enabling button
right  when you've done that don't waste any time getting out of there  once that crane starts movingwell it's bound to provoke some kind of response
right  autoshop you all set?
blow those suckers driscoll
we haven't used big bertha since we relocated the generator module that was four months ago  i can't ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle it's already costing too much as it is
i just wanted to be put on my own for a while  clear my head
didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars huh?
just once  afterwards i told him i didn't want to anymore  i wasn't ready he got pissed  then he broke up with me
do you have the suspect in custody?
the glory boys just want to finish their report so they can go home
not too much of the socializing type then?
no not really  more sort of the  'claustrophobic' type
is that a fact
uhhuh  used to get it pretty bad  i'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch
how long you been out here for now anyway?  three months?
four
and before that?
six month stint on datus
only six?
what is this?  'twenty questions'?
i deal with this stuff every day but a fireman you never get used to it  what happened up there? he was a candidate did he pay attention? was he listening?
just curious  there's a lot of talk goes around
real man' drink
want some?
nothing  with the satellite down we can't transmit over the mountain range he's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us
first light we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back
'we'?  you wanna fly out there with me?
sure  do me good to stretch my legs
do you think ackland'll sit tight?
there'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to
check out the tent
he wasn't listening to the right thing
hold on
agreed
when we get the link back and i send this in icc'll throw a fit
ah don't worry about icc  they're the least of your problems right now
what do you mean?
again?  how long before we start noticing the difference?
ackland?  i don't know him well enough to say  if we were back on earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure there's not much we can do out here
alright  pull some trackers and headsets out of stores and i'll sign a release for the weapons  cassie organise a team roster and put it on the board
what do i think?  i think if those marines from powell don't shift their butts getting here we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't
i'm out of ammo  get inside get inside
what do you listen to stephen?
detour  other way's blocked
don't wait for me
what can i do?
i can feel it moving around inside me you've got to kill me
i i can't
you have to
no
camped out by the navibeacon out on linson's range  they're making their own way back tomorrow
yeah exactly  those're preprogrammed course adjustments you're looking at
tactical nukes maybe?
you don't know nobody knows
yeah 'good evening' to you too
you should hit the sack too
nah i'll stick it out for another hour or so
what time's sundown?
'bout five minutes
give me a yell is something happens
you got it cowboy
miss harrington's resting mr dewitt she asked me to see who it is
we won't disturb her rest it seems she left her award in the taxicab will you give it to her?
it's a very famous name mr dewitt
i might
and what is your name?
phoebe
phoebe?
i call myself phoebe
why not? tell me phoebe do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
certainly mr dewitt
i expected to find this little room overcrowded with a theater full of people at your feet
i consider myself lucky they didn't throw things
you're more than kind but it's still miss channing's performance i'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original
you're more than modest
i need that report lt
it's not modesty i just don't try to kid myself
a revolutionary approach to the theater however if i may a suggestion
please do
i think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility it is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly
i don't think i've done anything to sound off about
we all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns if we don't blow them  who will?
even so one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy it'll be forgotten tomorrow
it needn't be
even if i wanted to  as you say  be less humble blow my own horn how would i do it? i'm less than nobody
i am somebody
investigator rimgale
i'd love to or should i pretend i'm busy?
let's have a minimum of pretending i'll want to do a column about you
i'm not enough for a paragraph
 perhaps more than one there's so much i want to know i've heard your story in bits and pieces your home in wisconsin your tragic marriage your financial attachment to margo  it started in san francisco didn't it?  i say  your idolatry of margo started in san francisco didn't it?
that's right
san francisco an oasis of civilization in the california desert tell me do you share my high opinion of san francisco?
yes i do
and that memorable night when margo first dazzled you from the stage  which theater was it in san francisco? was it  the shubert?
yes the shubert
a fine old theater the shubert full of tradition untouched by the earthquake  so sorry  fire by the way what was your husband's name?
i need to get in the trunk
eddie
eddie what?
i can wait where would you like to go? we'll make this a special night
you take charge
i believe i will
just some coffee
i'm not surprised after all that humble pie
nothing of the kind karen and i had a nice talk
heart to heart? woman to woman? including a casual reference to the part of "cora"  and your hopes of playing it
i discussed it very openly i told her that i had spoken to lloyd  and that he was interested
alderman
she mentioned of course that margo expects to play the part?
oddly enough  she didn't say a word about margo just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that i play the part
just like that
do you know eve  sometimes i think you keep things from me
it wasn't meant to be
i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone i've ever known to say a thing like that now  without any reason  when i need you more than ever
i hope you mean what you say eve i intend to hold you to it
dday
just like it
and tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of immortality
umnow is not a good time okay detective jackson's hurt  he's fine i've got a fire marshall shot detective jackson is hurt but not seriously
"don?"
stop rehearsing your column isn't it strange addison? i thought i'd be panicstricken want to run away or something instead i can't wait for tonight to come to come and go
are you that sure of tomorrow?
aren't you?
frankly  yes
all paved with diamonds and gold?
you know me better than that
paved with what then?
stars
almost four
plenty of time for a nice long nap  we rehearsed most of last night
don't you have any leads at all?
you could sleep too couldn't you?
why not?
why'd call me a killer?
did i say killer? i meant champion i get my boxing terms mixed
max is paying for it he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted well can i fix you a drink?
lloyd i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish  so he sent it up
some plain soda  lloyd must be expecting a record run in new haven
that's for tonight you're invited we're having everyone up after the performance
we're?
lloyd and i
no marty i don't
she's always been so fantastically devoted to lloyd i would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her
addison just a few minutes ago when i told you this would be a night to remember  that it would bring me everything i wanted
 something about an old road ending and a new one starting  paved with stars
i didn't mean just the theater
what else?
it's nothing of the kind lloyd loves me i love him
i know nothing about lloyd and his loves  i leave those to louisa may alcott but i do know you
i'm in love with lloyd
lloyd richards is commercially the most successful playwright in america
you have no right to say such things
jesus open your eyes seagrave cosgrove and now holcomb  fried in a goddamn highrise
 and artistically the most promising eve dear this is addison
 and karen
she doesn't know
we decided the night before last before we came up here
was the setting properly romantic  the lights on dimmers gypsy violins off stage?
the setting wasn't romantic but lloyd was he woke me up at three in the morning banging on my door  he couldn't sleep he told me  he's left karen he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until i promised to marry him we sat and talked until it was light he never went home
you sat and talked until it was light
we sat and talked addison i want a run of the play contract
there never was there'll never be another like you
well say something  anything congratulations skol  good work eve
holcomb? i didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet
i don't know what i take you for anything
it is possible  even conceivable  that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on  that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
i'm sure you mean something by that addison but i don't know what
look closely eve it's time you did i am addison dewitt i'm nobody's fool least of all  yours
i never intended you to be
yes you did you still do
 it's important right now that we talk killer to killer
champion to champion
not with me you're no champion you're stepping way up in class
addison will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly  and then get out so i can take my nap
just catch the son of a bitch
very well plainly and distinctly although i consider it unnecessary  because you know as well as i what i am about to say  lloyd may leave karen but he will not leave karen for you
what do you mean by that?
more plainly and more distinctly? i have not come to new haven to see the play discuss your dreams or to pull the ivy from the walls of yale i have come to tell you that you will not marry lloyd  or anyone else  because i will not permit it
what have you got to do with it?
everything because after tonight you will belong to me
i can't believe my ears
a dull cliche
belong  to you? that sound medieval  something out of an old melodrama
so does the history of the world for the past twenty years i don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this frankly i had hoped that you would somehow have known  have taken it for granted that you and i
 taken it for granted? that you and i
investigator
then if you won't get out i'll have you thrown out
what of it?
it is true that your parents were poor they still are and they would like to know how you are  and where they haven't heard from you for three years
what of it?
she never proved anything not a thing
but the $500 you got to get out of town brought you straight to new york  didn't it?
answer my question weren't you paid to get out of town?
she did like you she helped and trusted you you paid her back by trying to take bill away
that's not true
i was there i saw you and heard you through the dressing room door
this'll only take a minute there's two cops outside that want to ask you about this 
nonono
i had lunch with karen not three hours ago as always with women who want to find out things she told more than she learned   do you want to change your story about lloyd beating at your door the other night?
yes addison
and you realize  you agree how completely you belong to me?
yes addison
take your nap now and good luck for tonight
couldn't go on? you'll give the performance of your life
you can have one at max's
i don't think i'm going
why not?
didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3500 a month is crazy man
because i don't want to
max has gone to a great deal of trouble it's going to be an elaborate party and it's for you
no it's not  it's for this
it's the same thing isn't it?
exactly  here take it to the party instead of me
you're being childish
very well i shall drop you and go on to the party i have no intention of missing it
now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for
well i can't yell "oh butler" can i? maybe somebody's name is butler
you have a point an idiotic one but a point
it's nothing this is new york man  oh  i forgot bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers it's a good investment man she could make serious money
i don't want to make trouble all i want is a drink
you have me confused with dan dailey you go sit by the piano  and you come sit by me  good night
miss caswell is an actress a graduate of copacabana school of dramatic arts  ah eve
that's how you met me in passing
why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
because that is what they are go make him happy
like i just swam the english channel now what?
you next move it seems to me should be toward television
that's all television is my dear nothing but auditions
gable why a feller like that don't come east to do a play
alright cut cut cut
who said anything about the fucking street i've got more connects than you have lieutenant
what makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
this answer satisfies me a hundred percent
we all have abnormality in common we are a breed apart from the rest of the humanity we theater folk we are the original displaced personalities
and too many of them are produced
as soon as the peasants stop pawing her
hear hear
then you've heard too
i was there an eyewitness
you were there? at the play  last night?
a happy coincidence
they're alive aren't they? come on man everyone's making such a fucking fuss just because she's a nun just because she wears a penguin suit the church puts up 50 g for the guys who dared to rape her do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? of course not or even for your little sister? the virgin? like shit they would
margo
margo? lunching in public?
it's new margo but she's just as late as the old one
she may be later than you think
dear margo you were an unforgettable peter pan  you must play it again soon you remember miss caswell?
i do not how do you do?
it could only have been your natural timidity that kept you from mentioning it
you've heard of her great interest in the theater
we have that in common
then you two must have a long talk
susie's not a virgin anymore
amen
miss caswell at the moment is where i can lend no support  moral or otherwise
the ladies'  shall we say  lounge?
being violently ill to her tummy
it's good luck before an audition she'll be all right once it starts
over? it can't be i've come to read with her i promised max
the audition was called for 2:30 it is now nearly four
is it really? i must start wearing a watch i never do you know who read with miss caswell? bill?  lloyd?  well it couldn't have been max who?
naturally enough your understudy
i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy
she's fucking nine years old jesus christ
i refer to your new and unpregnant understudy eve harrington
eve my understudy
didn't you know?
of course i knew
it just slipped your mind
frankly i don't remember
just slipped your mind
completely nor i am sure could anyone else present tell you how miss caswell read or whether miss caswell read or rode a pogo stick
was she that bad?
i take it she read well
yeah? at least she's alive i see people get killed every day worse yet tortured first and then killed the nuns got off easy jeez cigarette burns everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns i'll show you cigarette burns
it wasn't reading it was a performance brilliant vivid something made of music and fire
how nice
in time she'll be what you are
a mass of music and fire that's me an old kazoo and some sparkles tell me  was bill swept away too or were you too full of revelation to notice?
bill didn't say  but lloyd was beside himself he listened to his play as if someone else had written it he said it sounded so fresh so new so full of meaning
how nice for lloyd and how nice for eve how nice for everybody
the implication being that i have not been reading them as written
to the best of my recollection neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation
the air lines have clocks even if you haven't i start shooting a week from monday  zanuck is impatient he wants me he needs me
bill
i'm not talking about the fucking church fuck the church but tell me do you believe in god?
huh?
this is eve harrington
where?
right here a minute ago
that's nice
geniuses don't need good luck  i do
we know you we've seen you before like this is it over  or just beginning?
maybe just a little around the edges
tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten   and you're going to be on time
everything everything's so funny
what's to believe?
thank you so much
is it sabotage does my career mean nothing to you? have you no human consideration?
show me a human and i might have
i'm a junk yard
heaven help me i love a psychotic
real diamonds in a wig the world we live in
where's my coat?
like a nylon lemon peel
byron couldn't have said it more graciously here we go
eve i'd forgotten they grew that way
that jesus christ was the son of god and he came to die for your sins
the lack of pretense that sort of strange directness and understanding
did she tell you about the theater and what it meant?
i told her i sounded off
all the religions in the world rolled into one and we're gods and goddesses isn't it silly suddenly i've developed a big protective feeling for her  a lamb loose in our big stone jungle
i understand they've got the indians pretty well in hand
bill
huh?
don't get stuck on some glamour puss
i'll try
you're not such a bargain you know conceited and thoughtless and messy
you believe that man is the beall and endall?
everybody can't be gregory peck
 you're a setup for some gorgeous wideeyed young babe
how childish are you going to get before you quit it?
i don't want to be childish i'd settle for just a few years
and cut that out right now
am i going to lose you bill? am i?
as of this moment you're six years old
call me when you get in
bill? have i gone crazy bill?
you're my girl aren't you?
yeah
that i am
then you're crazy
when  when are you coming back?
i leave in a week  the picture's all wrapped up we previewed last night those previews like opening out of town but terrifying there's nothing you can do you're trapped you're in a tin can
 in a tin can cellophane or wrapped in a navajo blanket i want you home
you in a hurry?
a big hurry be quick about it  so good night darling and sleep tight
wait a minute you can't hang up you haven't even said it
bill you know how much i do  but over the phone now really that's kid stuff
kid stuff or not it doesn't happen every day i want to heat it  and if you won't say it you can sing it
yeah  now's not a good time
ok ok fine but  do you believe in god?
sing it?
sure like the western union boys used to do
and who remembered it? who was there on the dot at twelve midnight?
the reading could have been better but you said it  now "many happy returns of the day"
many happy returns of the day
i get a party don't i?
of course birthday and welcome home who'll i ask?
it's no secret i know all about the party  eve wrote me
she did?
she hasn't missed a week since i left  but you know all that you probably tell her what to write anyway i sent her a list of people to ask  check with her
why?
yeah i will
how is eve? okay?
okay
i love you
i'll check with eve
what?
i love you too good night darling
see you
you're in a beehive pal didn't you know? we're all busy little bees full of stings making honey day and night   aren't we honey?
it won't play
who?
cut it out
this is my house not a theater in my house you're a guest not a director
to put me to bed? take my clothes off hold my head tuck me in turn off the lights tiptoe out? eve would wouldn't you eve?
you've heard it about when i looked through the wrong end of a camera finder
remind me to tell you about when i looked into the heart of an artichoke
i thought you were going to be late
when i'm guest of honor?
i had no idea you were even here
i ran into eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing
that never stopped you before
those fucking mob assholes
well we started talking she wanted to know all about hollywood she seemed so interested
she's a girl of so many interests
it's a pretty rare quality these days
she's a girl of so many rare qualities
so she seems
so you've pointed out so often so many qualities so often her loyalty efficiency devotion warmth affection  and so young so young and so fair
clyde fitch thought you may not think so was well before my time
i've always denied the legend that you were in 'our american cousin' the night lincoln was shot
i don't think that's funny
of course it's funny  this is all too laughable to be anything else you know what i think about this  this age obsession of yours  and now this ridiculous attempt to whip yourself up into a jealous froth because i spent ten minutes with a stagestruck kid
yeah
twenty minutes
thirty minutes forty minutes what of it?
stagestruck kid she's a young lady  of qualities and i'll have you know i'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities studying me as if  as if i were a play or a set of blueprints how i walk talk think eat sleep
now how can you take offense at a kid trying in every way to be as much like her ideal as possible
stop calling her a kid it so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which i would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges
for instance what?
for instance  you
this is my cue to take you in my arms and reassure you  but i'm not going to i'm too mad
 guilty
mad darling there are certain characteristics for which you are famous  on stage and off i love you for some of them  and in spite of others i haven't let those become too important to me they're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment  you've got to keep your teeth sharp all right but you will not sharpen them on me  or on eve
then c'mere i got something for you
what about her teeth? what about her fangs?
she hasn't cut them yet and you know it so when you start judging an idealistic dreamyeyed kid by the barroom benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society  i won't have it eve harrington has never by word look thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love and to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me  it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of
cut print it what happens in the next reel? do i get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
nothing really
the kid  junior that is  will be right down unless you'd like to take her drink up to her
i can always get a fresh one karen  you're a gibson girl
it hasn't been laid out we haven't finished with the embalming as a matter of fact you're looking at it the remains of margo channing sitting up it is my last wish to be buried sitting up
wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
you know nothing about feelings natural or unnatural
then without feeling your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the  shall we say happier side?
nah
if my guests do not like it here i suggest they accompany you to the nursery where i'm sure you will all feel more at home
everybody has a heart  except some people  of course i've got bicarb there's a box in the pantry we'll put your name on it max fabian it'll say there always just for you
what's all over?
the audition
eve?  how enchanting  wherever did you get the idea of having eve read with miss caswell?
you wouldn't understand  how was miss caswell?
so full of meaning fire and music
who?
the kid junior
gone
sure it is you're a virgin just like that nun and i'm gonna rape you
i must have frightened her away
i wouldn't be surprised sometimes you frighten me
poor little flower just dropped her petals and folded her tent
don't mix your metaphors
i mix what i like
okay mix
i'm nothing but a body with a voice no mind
what a body what a voice
the exship news' reporter no body no voice all mind
the gong rang the fight's over calm down
who?
i will not calm down
don't calm down
you're being terribly tolerant aren't you?
i'm trying terribly hard
well you needn't i will not be tolerated and i will not be plotted against
here we go
such nonsense what do you all take me for  little nell from the country? been my understudy for over a week without my knowing carefully hidden no doubt
now don't get carried away
 shows up for an audition when everyone knew i'd be here and gives a performance out of nowhere  gives a performance
you've been all through that with lloyd
a wiseguy paying 100 grand for the rapists if i turn then over direct to him
the playwright doesn't make the performance  and it doesn't just happen and this one didn't  full of fire and music and whatnot it was carefully rehearsed i have no doubt over and over full of those bill sampson touches
i am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts
paranoiac
i didn't know eve harrington was your understudy until half past two this afternoon
tell that to dr freud along with the rest of it
that word again i don't even know what it means
it's time you found out i love you  i love you you're a beautiful and intelligent woman   a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress   at the peak of her career you have every reason for happiness   every reason but due to some strange uncontrollable unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid   kid like eve to turn you into a hysterical screaming harpy now once and for all stop it
i've been aware of that for some time
well i am
i'll say
alright
you mean you could use it
don't be condescending
come on get up i'll buy you a drink
i admit i may have seen better days but i am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail  like a salted peanut
margo let's make peace
the terms are too high unconditional surrender
just being happy? just stopping all this nonsense about eve  and eve and me?
it's not nonsense
but if i tell you it is  as i just did were you listening to me?  isn't that enough?
i wish it were
then what would be enough?  if we were married?
"the strawberries"?
i wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something
you've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me margo tell me what's behind all this
i  i don't know bill just a feeling i don't know
i think you do know but you won't or can't tell me  i said before it was going to be my last try and i meant it i can't think of anything else to do i wish i could  we usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down then it comes up again and everything's fine but not this time  you know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people goodbye margo
that suddenly makes the whole thing believable
hear hear
but you may quote me as follows quote tonight miss margo channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play the like of which i have never seen before and expect rarely to see again unquote
he does not exaggerate i was good
you were great
glory hallelujah
the mets so anyway chalk up another 180 g for the game jesus christ that's almost half a million dollars ariane wait that's not good enough i'll ask the shithead for 280 g for the kids then it'll be a perfect 500 thousand yeah perfect 280 g for the kids yeah it's good i prepared or i wouldn't have thought to 
i'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all
the point is  in the cathedral a ball park or a penny arcade  we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends
i understand she is now the understudy in there
pass me the empty bottle i may find her why look there's rasputin
what would you like? texas?
i want everybody to shut up about eve just shut up about eve that's all i want give karen more wine   never have i been so happy isn't this a lovely room? the cub room what a lovely clever name where the elite meet never have i seen so much elite  and all with their eyes on me waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle but not tonight even eve i forgive eve there they go
you've got it backwards even for wilkesbarre
you know why i forgive eve? because she's left good behind  the four of us together like this it's eve's fault  i forgive her
groom
yes dear
i'm a catholic
you know what i'm going to be?
a cowboy
a married lady
with the paper to prove it
i'm going to have a home not just a house i'm afraid to stay in and a man to go with it i'll look up at six o'clock  and there he'll be remember karen?
a foursquare upright downright forthright married lady that's for me and no more make believe off stage or on remember lloyd  i mean it now grownup women only i might even play a mother  only one child of course not over eight  lloyd will you promise not to be angry with me?
eve eve harrington
i told you a lie we'll make it easily margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut
i just wondered
just wondered what?
yes
why
why what?
why you have to go out there
i don't have to i want to
is it the money?
eighty percent of it will go for taxes
then why? why if you're the best and most successful young director in the theater
the theatuh the theatuh   what book of rules says the theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of new york city? or london paris or vienna?  listen junior and learn want to know what the theater is? a flea circus also opera also rodeos carnivals ballets indian tribal dances punch and judy a oneman band  all theater wherever there's magic and makebelieve and an audience  there's theater donald duck ibsen and the lone ranger sarah bernhardt poodles hanneford lunt and fontanne betty grable rex and wild and eleanora duse you don't understand them all you don't like them all why should you? the theater's for everybody  you included but not exclusively  so don't approve or disapprove it may not be your theater but it's theater of somebody somewhere
i just asked a simple question
and i shot my mouth off nothing personal junior no offense   it's just that there's so much bushwah in this ivory green room they call the theatuh  sometimes it gets up around my chin
you brought it back to the church and then it made it's way back to me again
it's only one picture deal
so few come back
yeah they keep you under drugs out there with armed guards
also addison dewitt
every day
you didn't have to tell me
i have a suggestion  there's really not much time left  i mean you haven't had a minute alone yet and  well i could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket if you'd like
i think we'd like very much sure you won't mind?
of course not
goodbye mr sampson
yes
it means concentration of ambition desire and sacrifice such as no other profession demands and i'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary can't be  just someone to give so much for almost always so little
are you proud of me bill?
i'll admit i was worried when max called i had my doubts
you shouldn't have had any doubts
 after all the other day was one scene the woods are full of one scene sensations but you did it with work and patience you'll be a fine actress if that's what you want to be
is that what you want me to be?
i'm talking about you and what you want
so am i
what have i got to do with it?
everything
i was gonna bring it back myself
the names i've been called but never svengali  good luck
from what would i be running?
you're always after truth  on the stage what about off?
i'm for it
then face it i have since that first night  here  in the dressing room
when i told you what every young actress should know
when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you
your makeup's a little heavy
 and for you
you're quite a girl
he wants to know who brought in the chalice
you think?
i'm in love with margo hadn't you heard?
you hear all kinds of things
i'm only human rumors to the contrary and i'm as curious as the next man
find out
only thing what i go after i want to go after i don't want it to come after me
no thanks birdie
i know she just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo
but she just got here
she's on her way with half the men in the joint  it's only a fur coat
that's no mystery julio and paolo brought it in  you don't want to hurt those boys do you? i mean they sure as hell have got something coming but it ain't what the law wants to give them you understand?  no how could you understand
what did you expect  live sables?
a diamond collar gold sleeves  you know picture people
they can always grab oranges off trees this you can't do in times square
i never played fort sumter
buy some
the same size?
of course
well i guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic
oh brother
oh brother
alright?
what the fuck are you? a drug counselor or a drug dealer? and you don't even do your own product what kind of businessman are you?
miss coonan
if i haven't i'll find something till you're normal
you don't have to apologize for me  i'm sorry if i hurt your feelings it's just my way of talkin'
imagine all this admiration in just one room
see you home
something maybe grew a size bigger
when we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours
i couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours
just because you can't even work a zipper it was very thoughtful eve and i appreciate it
behind in your dues? how much?
the rich kind  jeez man the way you smoke that shit is suicide
i haven't got a union i'm slave labor
well?
but the wardrobe women have got one and next to a tenor a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business
ohoh
she's got two things to do  carry clothes an' press 'em wrong  an' just let anybody else muscle in
hmm?
you don't like eve do you?
do you want an argument or an answer?
an answer
no
fuck you  just give me back a little something for the road
why not?
now you want an argument
she works hard
night an' day
she's loyal and efficient
like an agent with one client
she thinks only for me   doesn't she?
well let's say she thinks only about you anyway
how do you mean that?
i'm sure that's very flattering birdie and i'm sure there's nothing wrong with that
very good very good the mets are gonna win tomorrow
my back's open  did the extra help get here?
there's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers who'd you call  the william morris agency?
you're not being funny i could get actors for less what about the food?
the caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres  voila
that french ventriloquist taught you a lot didn't he?
there was nothing he didn't know  there's a message from the bartender does miss channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
the only thing i ordered by mistake is the guests  they're domestic too and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns where's bill? he's late
late for what?
don't be dense the party
i ain't dense and he's been here twenty minutes
uh  right sure the mets are gonna win tomorrow
well i certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up
miss harrington
what are you doing here?
i  i guess i fell asleep
how did you get in here?
i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed she must've forgot something and when she went to get it she left the door open i sneaked in and hid till she finished then i just looked around  and pretty soon i was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so i turned them off  and then i guess i fell asleep
you were just looking around
that's all
what for?
you probably won't believe me
i know  take care of yourself man ok? be cool
probably not
it was for my report
what report? to whom?
about how you live what kind of clothes you wear  what kind of perfume and books  things like that you know the eve harrington clubs  that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
i've heard of them
ours was one of the first erasmus hall i'm the president
erasmus hall that's in brooklyn isn't it?
lots of actresses come from brooklyn barbara stanwyck susan hayward  of course they're just movie stars
i might
that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper
me?
i'll just pick up the broken glass
don't bother
subway
how long does it take?
with changing and everything a little over an hour
i don't care if i never get home
you rest i'll get it
why should you think i wouldn't be?
why should you be? after all six nights a week  for weeks  of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater
i hope you don't mind my speaking to you
i forgive you
not at all
i've seen you so often  it took every bit of courage i could raise
to speak to just a playwright's wife? i'm the lowest form of celebrity
you're margo channing's best friend you and your husband are always with her  and mr sampson what's he like?
bill sampson? he's  he's a director
he's the best
he'll agree with you tell me what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out? just huddle in that doorway and wait?
oh no i see the play
you see the play? you've seen the play every performance?  but don't you find it  i mean apart from everything else  don't you find it expensive?
standing room doesn't cost much i manage
you can't forgive me after what i've done  i've fucked up bigtime i've been bad real bad
oh no
she's got to meet you
no i'd be imposing on her i'd be just another tonguetied gushing fan
but if i'd known maybe some other time i mean looking like this
you look just fine   by the way what's your name?
eve eve harrington
not at all  margo this is eve harrington
my husband
try
well
i forgive you
it couldn't possibly interest you
i think i'd better it's been  well i can hardly find the words to say how it's been
i'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinee
not just that way as a friend
i'd like that
some hollywood movie star her plane got in late
discouraging isn't it? women with furs like that where it never gets cold
hollywood
tell me eve  how are things with you? happy?
lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality   next to that sable my new mink seems like an old bedjacket   you've done your share eve you've worked wonders with margo
alright
please please don't forgive me i've always hated you for that
karen
karen   isn't it awful i'm about to ask you for another favor  after all you've already done
nobody's done so much eve you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases what is it?
well miss channing's affairs are in such good shape there isn't enough to keep me as busy as i should be really  not that i've ever considered anything that would take me away from her but the other day  when i heard mr fabian tell miss channing that her understudy was going to have a baby and they'd have to replace her
i don't let myself think about it even   but i do know the part so well and every bit of the staging there'd be no need to break in a new girl   but suppose i had to go on one night? to an audience that came to see margo channing no i couldn't possibly
don't worry too much about that margo just doesn't miss performances if she can walk crawl or roll  she plays
the show must go on
no dear margo must go on  as a matter of fact i see no reason why you shouldn't be margo's understudy
do you think miss channing would approve?
i think she would cheer
why? why can't you hate me? hate me please help me  hate me help me hate me
but mr richards and mr sampson
they'll do as they're told
of course
you won't forget it?
i won't forget
i seem to be forever thanking you for something don't i?
but there must be some reason something i've done without knowing
the reason is margo and don't try to figure it out einstein couldn't
if i thought i'd offended her of all people
eve i'm fond of margo too but i know margo and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants
i forgive you
well  if she's got to pick on someone i'd just as soon it was me
no eve i won't forget
don't bother i can take it up myself
please
mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all
they certainly don't waste much time
nothing definite yet  it's just to have lunch
don't get up  and don't act as if i were the queen mother
i don't expect you to be pleasant
i don't intend to be
why? jesus why me? why can't i wash the ashes from my forehead year after year after year? and why am i still drunk on your blood the taste of your flesh on my tongue? worst of all why can't i feel the nails in my palms the spear in my side the crown of thorns round my head? why do i have to know over and over that it was you you who died; died for my sins and that i will die for nothing why?
can't we sit down? just for a minute
there can't be very much
oh but there is
 and easy or not i won't believe a word
why shouldn't you?  please sit down
 and you felt just like that talking to addison
in a way you find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change  and they become his words  and suddenly you're not saying what you mean but what he means
do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things  that they were all addison?
no i don't expect you to believe anything except that the responsibility is mine and the disgrace
let's not get overdramatic
why do i dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? and why have i never forgotten that if she then i 
you've really got a low opinion of me haven't you? we'll i'll give you some pleasant news i've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town miss channing should be happy to hear that to know how loyal her friends are  how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be
i'm not crying
tell me how did your lunch turn out  with the man from hollywood?
some vague promises of a test that's all  if a particular part should come along one of those things
but the raves about your performance
 an understudy's performance
well i think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is really if nothing else  and don't underestimate him  you have a powerful friend in addison
he's not my friend you were my friends
he can help you
i wish i'd never met him i'd like him to be dead i want my friends back
i forgive you
i'll never get over it
yes you will you theater people always do nothing is forever in the theater love or hate success or failure  whatever it is it's here it flares up and burns hot  and then it's gone
i wish i could believe that
give yourself time don't worry too much about what people think you're very young and very talented   and believe it or not if there's anything i can do
something most important you can do
you want to play "cora" you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it
if you told him so he'd give me the part he said he would
after all you've said don't you know the part was written for margo?
it could have been  fifteen years ago it's my part now
you talk just as addison said you did
all right cop i want my money
"cora" is my part you've got to tell lloyd it's for me
i don't think anything in the world could make me say that
over my dead body
that won't be necessary addison knows how margo happen to miss that performance  how i happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town   it's quite a story addison could make quite a thing of it  imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth i had a time persuading him   you'd better sit down you look a bit wobbly  if i play "cora" addison will never tell what happened  in or out of print a simple exchange of favors and i'm so happy i can do something for you  at long last  your friendship with margo  your deep close friendship  what would happen to it do you think if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her  for my benefit? and you and lloyd  how long even in the theater before people forgot what happened  and trusted you again?  no it would be so much easier on everyone concerned if i were to play "cora" and so much better theater too
i'd do much more  for a part that good
but not all of it  not that lloyd and i are going to be married
thank you karen
how do you do mr richards
every performance? then  am i safe in assuming you like it?
i'd like anything miss channing played
it's still my money if you want to have a chance at any part of it shithead you will take my $120000 and bet on tomorrow's game
there was an item in the times i like the title 'footsteps on the ceiling'
let's get back to this one have you really seen every performance?  why? i'm curious
'remembrance'
not at all
farmers were poor in those days that's what dad was  a farmer i had to help out so i quit school and i went to milwaukee i became a secretary in a brewery  when you're a secretary in a brewery  it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else everything is beer it wasn't much fun but it helped at home   and there was a little theater group like a drop of rain in the desert that's where i met eddie he was a radio technician we played 'liliom' for three performances i was awful  then the war came and we got married eddie was in the air force  and they sent him to the south pacific you were with the owi weren't you mr richards?  that's what 'who's who' says well with eddie gone my life went back to beer except for a letter a week one week eddie wrote he had a leave coming up i'd saved my money and vacation time i went to san francisco to meet him  eddie wasn't there they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee  the one that came from washington to say that eddie wasn't coming at all that eddie was dead   so i figured i'd stay in san francisco i was alone but couldn't go back without eddie i found a job and his insurance helped and there were theaters in san francisco and one night margo channing came to play in 'remembrance' and i went to see it and  well  here i am
i hope so mr richards good night
i was dreadful miss channing believe me  i have no right to be anyone's understudy much less yours
of course it is
there are other plays
not with you in them not by mr richards
what about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
san francisco it was the last week i went one night the most important night in my life  until this one anyway i found myself going the next night  and the next and the next every performance then when the show went east  i went east
the four of you must have so much to say to each other  with mr sampson leaving
well  if i'm not in the way
i won't be a minute
i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time
performance number one thousand of this one  if i play it that long  will take place in a wellpadded booby hatch
you certainly can especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning
i mean the performance except for you you'd think he'd never even directed it  it's disgraceful the way they change everything around
well teacher's away and actors will be actors
during your second act scene with your father roger ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch he's been coming closer down every night
fuck yesterday's game the world series is seven games not six put in my bet
when he gets too close i'll spit in his eye
well you've done so much what's new?
the curtains i made them myself
they are lovely aren't they lovely birdie?
don't bother mrs brown'll be along for it in a minute
no trouble at all
very becoming it looks better on you than it did on me
i can imagine you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there  are you sure you won't want it yourself?
quite sure i find it just a bit too  too "seventeenish" for me
oh come now as though you were an old lady i'm on my way is there anything more you've thought of?
alright
let me think about it
there's the script to go back to the guild
i've got it
 and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man
right here
it seems i can't think of a thing you haven't thought of
that's my job  see you at tea time
eve   by any chance did you place a call from me to bill for midnight california time?
oh golly and i forgot to tell you
yes dear you forgot all about it
well i was sure you'd want to of course being his birthday and you've been so busy these past few days and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards  and i guess i was asleep when you got home
there's nothing to think about either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing
yes i guess you were it  it was very thoughtful of you eve
mr sampson's birthday i certainly wouldn't forget that you'd never forgive me  as a matter of fact i sent him a telegram myself
i'm sorry i didn't mean to
i wouldn't like
some snowy night in front of the fire in the meantime while we're on the subject will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? the caterer forgot them the varnish wasn't dry or something
of course
thank you eve i'd like a martini  very dry
i had no idea you knew each other
hello miss channing
how are you making out in mr fabian's office?  i don't want you working the child too hard max  just because you promised as you see i kept my promise too
yeah really i'm no fucking asshole man i'm a fucking cop
really eve? why?
well if you'd been here to begin with i wouldn't have dared to read at all
why not?
 and if you'd come in the middle i'd have stopped i couldn't have gone on
what a pity all that fire and music being turned off
hi  "well now mis' channin' ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah we was mo' stahved out you might say  an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about lovestahved suth'n women  love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the south"
i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny 'aged in wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play
it's just that you get me so mad sometimes of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about
ain't it the truth?
yes it is you're talented famous wealthy  people waiting around night after night just to see you even in the wind and rain
ok cop i want you to give yourself and your friends on the force a message tell them i've got my own reasons to be very interested in whomever did the job on the nuns i'll double the church reward if you bring those punks direct to me 100 g cash get it?
autograph fiends they're not people  those little beast who run in packs like coyotes
they're your fans your audience
they're nobody's fans they're juvenile delinquents mental detectives they're nobody's audience they never see a play or a movie even  they're never indoors long enough
you've what?
she's just outside the door
the heaveho
harrington
i'm so sorry harrington won't you sit down?
i was telling margo and lloyd about how often you'd seen the play
please don't play governess karen i haven't your unyielding good taste i wish i'd gone to radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it  he needed help at the notions counter  i'm being rude now aren't i? or should i say "ain't i"?
yeah sucker you better be there
i'm so happy you're happy
of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet
peace and quit is for libraries
roughly ten minutes
how far to the station?
three or four miles
any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
none in sight there aren't many along this back road
not many car either not much chance of a lift
it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous
all right what are you gonna do?
i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down
be brave he'll come back  with or without gas
it doesn't matter
i detest cheap sentiment
we've all seemed a little tense lately
come to think of it i haven't been very pleasant for weeks for that i'm truly sorry more than any two people i know i don't want you and lloyd to be angry with me
we're never deeply angry we just get sore the way you do we know you too well
so many people  know me i wish i did i wish someone would tell be about me
you're margo just  margo
and what is that? besides something spelled out in light bulbs i mean besides something called temperament which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice infants behave the way i do you know they carry on and misbehave  they'd get drunk if they knew how  when they can't have what they want when they feel unwanted and insecure  or unloved
i want 15 on the mets
what about bill?
he's in love with you
more than anything in this world i love bill and i want bill i want him to want me but me not margo channing and if i can't tell they apart  how can he?
why should he  and why should you?
bill's in love with margo channing he's fought with her worked with her loved her but ten years from now  margo channing will have ceased to exist and what's left will be what?
margo bill is all of eight years younger than you
those years stretch as the years go on i've seen it happen too often
not to you not to bill
isn't that what they always say?
silly isn't it? you'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm
how about 7 1/2?
well
let's not fumble for excuses not here and now with my hair down at best let's say i've been oversensitive to well to the fact that she's so young  so feminine and helpless to so many things i want to be for bill funny business a woman's career the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster you forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman that's one career all females have in common  whether we like it or not  being a woman sooner or later we've all got to work at it no matter what other careers we've had or wanted and in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed  and there he is without that you're not woman you're something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings  but you're not a woman   slow curtain the end
about what?
this i can't tell you how sorry i am
don't give it another thought one of destiny's many pranks after all you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank
i just can't believe it
it get better " about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage shall we say  younger  actresses; about miss harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity"
i can't believe eve said those things
lloyd says it's a publicity release
the little witch must have had indians runners out snatching critics out of bars steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up well she won't get away with it nor will addison dewitt and his poison pen if equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it i will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down mr dewitt's ugly throat
are you sure?
well all right
with tears
but not right away? first the business of fighting them off chin up stout fella
check
very classy stuff lots of technique
you'll be there won't you
loud
the critics thought so the audiences certainly think so  packed houses tickets for months in advance  i can't see that either of lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any
easy now
that book is out of print karen those days are gone fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets  they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches
yeah i'm sure
if you'd only see her you're her whole life  you must have spotted her by now she's always there
it's about time we did it's about time margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off
in a minute
up to here that's where i've got it  up to here of all the star ridden presumptuous hysterical
margo again
and again and again two hours late for the audition to begin with
that's on time for margo
then a childish heavyhanded routine about not knowing eve was her understudy
it's just possible she didn't
of course she knew for one thing addison told her how superbly eve had read the part  karen let me tell you about eve she's got everything  a born actress sensitive understanding young exciting vibrant
okay
i wanna go double or nothing on the next game
 don't run out of adjectives dear
 everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about until his play becomes a vehicle for miss channing
margo hasn't done badly by it
margo margo's great she knows it that's the trouble she can play peck's bad boy all she wants and who's to stop her? who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
what is?
we're driving out to the country tomorrow night just the four of us bill margo you and i
well we've spent weekends before with nobody talking   just be sure to lock up all blunt instruments and throwable objects
when you asked a minute ago it was fivefortytwo it is now five fortythree when you ask a minute from no it will be
i just don't want margo to miss her train as it is she'll barely make the theater
fivefiftyfive we'll be at the station in plenty of time
double or nothing? are you fucking out of your mind?
just a little skid that's all this road's like glass
i guess i didn't look you know i don't pay attention to those things
incredible
what a way to die  trying to get an actress to the theater in time tell max i want to be buried with royalties
don't joke about such things
where'd you get all that information?
eve
eve?
she's been to see me as a matter of fact she left just before you came in  you just missed her
that was a pity
i'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
she wanted to explain about her interview wanted to apologize to someone  and didn't dare face margo
i wonder why
that's quite a change of subject
what with taxes coming up  and since i'm a playwright and not an oil well operator  well i've been thinking
i'm trying hard to follow you
if  instead of waiting until next season to do 'footsteps on the ceiling' which is in pretty good shape  and if margo can be talked into going on tour with 'aged in wood'  we could put 'footsteps' into production right away
i'm beginning to catch up
if we could cast it properly that is
maybe get some younger actress for the part? someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
you've got to admit it would be a novelty
take your money? this guy will blow up your house and everyone in it
now you're quoting addison or eve
eve would ask abbott to give her costello
no i got the idea myself  while she was talking to me
with gestures of course
for once to write something and have it realized completely for once not to compromise
now just a minute
margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise
now just a minute
it strikes me that eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious
on her knees i have no doubt very touching very academyofdramatic arts
there's just no way the mets will lose this game gooden is pitching and strawberry is ready to break out
that bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left radcliffe
the cynicism you refer to i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys
margo in the cub room i couldn't be more surprised if she'd said grant's tomb
i'm glad bill's back
they'd die without each other
such as?
you  for one i told her you were set on margo playing the part  and i certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval
margo
what are you going to wear?
i have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say
that's my problem just put in my bet
nothing much she apologized
not much
nothing
did miss harrington tell you to call mr richards?
i'm a human being i've got some
 and for my feelings in particular for my play my career  and now for a frightened hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the theater
old wives' tales born of envy and jealousy and a phobia against truth
then tell me this isn't true that your concern for your play and career is one thing  and that poor frightened hysterical girl another  and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career
that was way back
within your time buster lloyd honey be a playwright with guts write me one about a nice normal woman who shoots her husband
what money?
i doubt very much that you'd like her in 'the hairy ape'
and you pose as a playwright a situation pregnant with possibilities  and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep
 among so many quiet qualities
what is he talking about?
where is she?
up in the room
too many and you've got a new guest a movie star from hollywood
shucks and my autograph book is at the cleaners
not exactly sometimes though i wish i understood you better
when you do let me in on it
don't bullshit me
i will
the play? all right i guess
"cora" she's  still a girl of twenty?
twentyish it isn't important
don't you think it's about time it became important?
how do you mean?
don't be evasive
margo you haven't got any age
miss channing is ageless spoken like a press agent
i know what i'm talking about after all they're my plays
this psycho can
spoken like an author  lloyd i'm not twentyish i am not thirtyish three months ago i was forty years old forty four oh  that slipped out i hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it now i feel as if i'd suddenly taken all my clothes off
week after week to thousands of people you're as young as you want
 as young as they want you mean and i'm not interested in whether thousands of people think i'm six or six hundred
just one person isn't that so?  you know what this is all about don't you? it has very little to do with whether you should play "cora"  it has everything to do with the fact that you've had another fight with bill
eve? eve my understudy? but i had no idea
i thought you knew she was put on over a week ago
it seems almost inconceivable that i haven't seen her backstage but with so many people loitering around well well so eve is not working for max after all   max you sly puss
you'd have been proud of her
i'm sure
she was a revelation
oooo big fucking scary guy just put $120000 on tomorrow's game
to you too?
what do you mean?
i mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twentyfouryearold character played by twentyfouryearold actress
that's beside the point
it's right to the point also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you  so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them
 in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac
you knew when you came in that the audition was over that eve was your understudy playing that childish game of cat and mouse
not mouse never mouse if anything  rat
you have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most
perfectly innocent man have been hanged for less i'm lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately  as if it were holy gospel
hey
you're a fucking joke you know that?  he's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended and i've been waiting here since  forget it listen up you're gonna get us both fucking killed you know that
i never said it was
then you listened as if someone else had written you play  whom did you have in mind? sherwood? arthur miller? beaumont and fletcher?
usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater
it's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto
i have no intention of having an accident
it's not important whether you do we are wearing long underwear
the audience will want its money refunded believe me
thank you lloyd godspeed
too bad
city hall that's for prize fighters and reporters  i see a cathedral a bishop banks of flowers
uhuh i'm gonna win just make sure the bet gets in
lloyd i want you to be big about this the world is full of love tonight no woman is safe
you know she probably means well after all
she is a louse
i mean really deeply angry
i don't think i could be
well i don't want to play "cora"
what's your being married got to do with it?
it means i've finally got a life to live i don't have to play parts i'm too old for  just because i've got nothing to do with my nights  i know you've made plans i'll make it up to you believe me i'll tour a year with this one anything  only you do understand  don't you lloyd?
we are ready with your call to beverly hills
call what call?
good i'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble i hate that motherfucking house and 
it this templeton 89970? miss margo channing?
that's right but i don't understand
we are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight california time to mr william sampson in beverly hills
i placed?
go ahead please
i just played it
play it again
but that was the fourth straight time
then this will be five i suppose you think i'm too drunk to count
no you're just crazy about "liebestraum"
he's gonna kill you man do you hear me motherfucker? you dead get it?
"liebestraum"
look miss channing it's kind of depressing if you don't mind my saying so everybody's kind of dying on the vine
my dear horowitz in the first place i'm paying you union scale second it's my piano third if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine they can get off the vine and go home "liebestraum"
how about me what?
i ain't gonna die not with a hit
poor max heartburn?  it's that miss caswell i don't know why she doesn't give addison heartburn
i love you max i really mean it i love you come to the pantry
the situation i'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out i made a promise
miss caswell?  what?
an audition for the part we're replacing what'shername your sister
i've been dodging bullets since i was fourteen no one can kill me i'm fucking blessed i'm fucking catholic
i feel right now like there's one burning in me
when's the audition?
a couple of weeks
i tell you what why don't i read with her?
would you?
anything to help you out max
this is real cooperation i appreciate it
not at all and you could do me a big favor if you would
all you got to do is name it
give eve harrington job in you office
what case?
margo i wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you
you said yourself my inventory was in good shape  all of my merchandise put away to keep her here with nothing to do  i'd be standing in her way and you need her max
but what could she do?
she'd be a great help  read scripts interview people you have to see get rid of the ones you don't have to you'd be a man of leisure
well
think of your health max  more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track
i don't know if this would be a wise move
promise
i promise
that's my max
the fucking rapists man the punks who raped that nun the $50000 reward from the church remember?
are you threatening me with legal action mr fabian?
are you breaking the contract?
answer my question
who am i to threaten? i'm a dying man
i didn't hear you
i said i'm a dying man
not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill
i sure couldn't hurt it could i?
it was fine the way it was
it was bullshit the way it was
yeah sure yeah we're on it bigtime lots of leads you bet
i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia?
what have you been here nine months?i been in this business since i was sixteen
and you've had some fucking meteoric rise that's for sureby the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau
you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale
bradlee went to harvard
they're all the same all those ivy league placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart
i'm smart enough to know my story was solid
mine's better
no way
read 'em both and you'll see
that 50 g could help you 
mainly it has to do with your choice of words
yeah?
fuck you carl
it's ok; i'm sorry i called you a failure
forget it the main thing  did you call me a failure?
i was sure trying
let me lay a little theory on you
i'm not interested in theory what do we know? for example hunt's disappeared
well barker tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the airconditioning system
and mccord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the democratic convention  the times has got to be full of it it can't be crazy cubans
you've really got a problem
what though?  it can't be the republicanshe'd never allow something as stupid as this not when he's gonna slaughter mcgovern anyway
right nixon didn't get where he got by being dumb  listen that was a watergate question
hmm
what do you think he meant this particular incident? were there others? how would we find out? you know anyone important?
i lived here all my life i got a million contacts but they're all bus boys and bellhops
hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant
maybe a political operative of some sort
a spy you mean?
it makes sense; hunt worked for the cia and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy
we need a sympathetic face
after that i swore i'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it  and i haven't since except for bogey's party and my stunning gastrointestinal display 
i can'ti can't answer you just because you want me to answer you
here look i'll give you the psyho's number you call him yourself and tell him wnat you want
about the past year
i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion
and you haven't called him?
the fucking new york times
see?
i'm trying
fifteen phone calls
fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep
why didn't we get that?
christ and i even know somebody at the phone company
sister we all know what happened to you yesterday morning i expected that you would want to speak to me about it but you could have come to my office your being here in the confessional implies that you sister have done something wrong you haven't i assure you i feared you might have misplaced feelings of guilt if you condemn yourself because you experienced feelings of curiosity or even pleasure you mustn't 
you do?with access to records?
for the paper no; for us plenty  i waited a long time and finally this big guyi guess a bodyguard he left and i knocked and she remembered me we talked awhile
and?and?
she was panicked carlevery time i mentioned watergate you could tell
were you eyebrow reading?
it was there i just don't get it; a creep secretary being scared that's one thing but what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in america have to be afraid of?
alphabetically on the creep phone list miss helen abbott of south george street
you're not a kid anymore
my first day as a copy boy i was sixteen and wearing my only grownup suitit was cream colored at 2:30 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says "my god haven't you washed the carbon paper yet? if it's not washed by three it'll never by dry for tomorrow"  and i said "am i supposed to do that?" and he said "absolutely it's crucial" so i run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the men's room i'm standing there washing it and it's splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak and he says "what the fuck do you think you're doing?" and i said "it's 2:30 i'm washing the carbon paper"  just wanted you to know i've done dumber things than get us lost that's all
i never scared anyone before
it's funny you knew but the first thing i think of is kneading the bread that i help bake for the soup kitchen maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt
it's not us they were scared before we got there  what do we know?
facts or theory?
anything you've got
we know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked
and that something's got to be more than just hunt liddy and the five burglarsthose indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down what else do we know?
i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us that's all
it's safe try it you'll see
you believe in the president you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal
we appreciate your positionreally
and i'm a republican
i also thought of that bread father and of that night six days ago when the mother superior died and i kept the cool damp cloth on her forehead freshly moist father what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your legs to serve god?
sure
who'd you vote for?
when?
'68
nixon
you voted for him
go on go on
we've got to find out who the five guys arethe five with access to the slush fundthey were aware of the breakin
then tomorrow's grand jury indictments will just be bullshit
it goes very highwe've got to find out where
i think of running for help and falling to my knees in prayer
we will
she was really paranoid the bookkeeper
that happens to people  ok go on
you mean who's going to play the mean mp and who's going to be the nice one?  whichever
he's another ivy leaguer so he'll probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if you're not
you want me to be the bastard
and i'll just shitkick in my usual way
nothingi just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am  i never like it when the other guy's human
colson
we'd like to wait til we have all five before we print it
as i have prayed day and night since the desecration of this church yesterday morning  and my sin you see father 
the lookout in the motor inn?  he say anything we don't know?
just that a lot of reports were sent to creep but he doesn't name who not here anyway
shit
we gotta top the times
i know i know
if we could name the guys got the reports we'd be ahead again
shit who do we know?
i know a lawyer at justice
has he got an ax?
almost every source we've used has been republican this guy's a card carrying democrat
yes sister?
then he's got an ax  call him anyway
i haven't said anything
for the first time i'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter woodward i got a tip a guy called me up with a tip  someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats dirty tricks shit like that the fbi knows about segretti howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to himthey interrogated him but on account of segretti wasn't involved with the breakin they didn't follow through but segretti did a lot of travelinghe called these lawyers from different places and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing
how high up which republicans?
that's what we've got to find out but segretti went to southern cal and so did a bunch of nixon men
haldeman i know who else?
dwight chapin nixon's appointments chiefhe knew segretti in school maybe i'm crazy but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense what were the three theories?
the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans
now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasn't any reason they were so far ahead but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in
so maybe watergate wasn't really about watergatemaybe that was just a piece
yesterday morning god gave me but one chance to use something else to serve him not my arms or my legs but something i used for the first time for the last time and will never use again my vagina
because a year before the republicans weren't ahead not in the polls muskie was running ahead of nixon then before he self destructed
if he selfdestructed
segovia begged me for me secret but i said "no andres you'll have to try and make it without me"
'cause i only know four chords
you asking would i have been one of the president's men?  i would have been
it makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the white house? each new member of the president's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon
you think this was clawsen's initiation?
could have won him a fraternity paddle with a white house seal  god knows it worked
we're inside the white house now
mitchell stans magruder kalmbach
you knew them?  who were they sister? who are these boys? what are the names of these  good boys you knew?
we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the waythat fifth man was haldeman
who?
haldeman
what if i went up and introduced myselfthink he'd slug me?
well we are trying to ruin his life
it's nothing personal though 
what's the matter?
same as magruder i don't like it when they turn out to be human
i wish we were investigating attila the hun
maybe we are
how 'bout
he said john haldeman not bob haldeman
and the fbi confirmswhat more do you need?
deep throat won't confirmi never thought he was scared of anyone but he's scared of haldeman
i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury 
we got twenty minutes to deadline
hmm?
what was the mistake? do you think it's been rigged all along the way leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? they couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone you know what that means?
only everything
goddamnit
so i guess you could say that we screwed up but we weren't wrong
you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues  you could give me something
blak it is
john n mitchell while serving as us attorney general personally controlled a secret cash fund that
jeeeeeeesus
fund that was used to gather information against the democrats
jeeeeeeesus
according to sources involved in the watergate investigation beginning in the spring of 1971
jeeeeeeesus
almost a year before he left the justice department
jeeeeeeeeesus
to become president nixon's campaign manager on march 1 mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund
all that crap you're putting it in the paper? it's all been denied you tell your publishertell katie graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published good christ that's the most sickening thing i ever heard
i'm on it
sir i'd like to ask you a few
what time is it?
11:30
morning or night?
night
oh
listen i've got a dinnercan't we do this tomorrow?
i'm on deadline
whatever
the telephone calls we know about that
that simpleton is holding back the race  they got rid of us and keep those two buffoons mantan and sleep 'n eat y'knowwhati'msayin'?
the rest is barker's bank records it's mostly the eightynine thousand in mexican cashier's checks
yeah that was in the times this morning
this?  naw
howard hunt?
sure him i liked he was a very nice person secretive too traveled all over but a decent man
any idea what he did?
oh the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating kennedy
teddy kennedy?
sure i remember seeing a book about chappaquiddick on his desk and he was always getting material out of the white house library and the library of congress and
i'm so glad
we know  we know  yo check it my black brothers we can't let this slide  not this injustice nah no way  dem' two real coons iz ill
i'd really like to see mr dardis
and you will  but not now
i called him from washington he's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning
i told you he had to go out on a case
he is not in the car  sorry
well of course
good just tell him i was here that i'm sorry i missed him
that's right
you can't
mind if i try?
1/16 tru' 'dat  true 'dat
i've got a lot of energy
listenwe know you're involved in thiswe're going to get the story why not help?
they never told me anything except my own rolei had to find out the rest in the papers
by "they" you mean?
i know where dwight works
when did he hire you?
i didn't do anything wrong
tell that to muskie
oh maybe nickel and dime stuff
during the florida primary you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls
did he gots to be
sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe  off the record
you wrote the canuck letterthe one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians
i didn't
but you know who did
when you guys print it in the paper then i'll know  i'm a lawyer and i'll probably go to jail and be disbarred and what did i do that was so awful?
chapin did contact you then?
sureoff the record
on the orders of haldeman?
i don't know anything about haldeman except dwight's frightened of him everybody's frightened of himchrist i wish i'd never gotten messed around with thisall i wanna do is sit in the sun; sit swim see some girls
it gets interesting if it was haldeman because our word is that when chapin says something he's gotten the ok from haldeman and when haldeman says something he's gotten the ok from the president
yo black you looking for trouble
can't help you
at usc you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking  ever wonder if nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
so?
i think it might be helpful if you'd send me to miami
that was awhile ago
"i think it might be helpful if you'd send me to toronto" that was your spiel then "the lifestyles of deserters"  i'm still waiting for it
you're the fella who forgot he rented a hertz car do i have to tell you they didn't forget to send us the bill?
yes
we've just been talking to young
and?
ho
goddamnit when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story
deep throat?
if they ever start calling us goddamn liars  it's time to start circling the wagons
what?
there's nothing new in it
it makes the breakin realit's a major goddamn story  i'm not going to kick ass over this but i'd like you to know i hate getting beat i just hate it don't forget that i hate it
i could care less about where it happened; what happened is what counts  put him on  ken i'm sorry it was goddamn beirut and they were having a crisis what's up kid?  slow down ken you sound frazzled  a wife and a family and a cat and a dog right ken  ken i would never print that you were in marilyn's apartment at night unless of course you force me to
absolutely
what about you?
where are your bills carl?
that'swhati'mtalkin'bout that'swhati'mtalkin'bout  i want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of mantan  the new millennium minstrel show
oh they're here  i'm keeping much better records now hannah  see? 
carl it's a jungle  i suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles  you'd give a stranger the shirt off your backexcept it wouldn't be paid for
lot of pressure at the star  carl when we got married you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split you were solvent that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life and now look at this  how much did the damn bike cost?
five hundred; six maybe
you're two months behindyou got enough to cover?
i think
give me your checkbook then
it's right under that pile
there's always a later plane
you're a sex junkie you know that carl?
yeah
nobody's perfect  i'm glad you're out of it hannah you're a terrific reporter and i turned you into a bookkeeper
anyplace really public they'd know about itthey know everything at the committee carl
you don't really think you're being followed?
this girlfriend of mine at the committee the other day she went back to the da to tell the things the fbi didn't ask her that night her boss he knew what she'd done they control everything; that's how they know it all
fbi too?
you don't believe me? well i was working the weekend of the breakin and my god all the executives were running around like crazyyou had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machineand when the fbi came to investigate they never even asked me about it
if you don't like it down there why don't you quit?
i don't know what they'd do to me
hey easy
we're a long way from high school carl  and i'm scared
oh i'm sorry  did i embarrass you sweetheart?  oh
i'm gonna start a chant and i want y'all to follow me  let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show
just let me get a match
all those articles you people write where do you find that stuff?
we don't tell anyone that which is why you can talk to us and if we can't verify what you say someplace else we don't print it that's another reason you can relax
i'm relaxedlight your cigarette
i never worked for sloan or stans
right right i've got to go  why did you lie just then?
no never in so many words
it's obvious you want to talk to someonewell i'm someone
it was all in hundreds wasn't it?
a lot of it was i just thought it was sort of an allpurpose political fundyou know for taking fat cats to dinner things like that
yeah
could buy a lot of steaks 350000 dollars
i can't be positive that it was used for the breakin but people sure are worried
which people?
the ones who could disburse the money
who were they?
there were a group of themi think five i don't know their names
sloan knew which five didn't he? 
omigod there was so much of it six million came in one twoday period six million cash we couldn't find enough places to put it i thought it was all legal i guess i did til after the breakin when i remembered gordon got so much of it
gordon liddy you mean?
it was all so crazythe day after the breakin he gave us a speech bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of hisgordon told us not to let jim mccord ruin everythingdon't let one bad apple spoil the barrel he said you just know that when gordon liddy's calling someone a bad apple something's wrong somewhere  it's all so rotten and getting worse and all i care about is hugh sloan his wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right and he quit he quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it
alright  here we go  let's go niggers  let's go niggers
think sloan's being set up as a fall guy for john mitchell? sometimes it looks that way
'cause i'm not calling out from the phone company anymore  i think the place is bugged
so tell me about the times article
what do you want to know?
no games irwin; give
my big civil rights buddy  boy if john mitchell was after your phone records would you be screaming  what're you onto?
something maybe big
and that makes anything you do ok is that it?
just tell me about the goddamn article
it was accurate but i can't get a fuller listing for youall barker's phone records have been subpoenaed
let's go niggers
who by?
a miami da the guy doing the investigating is named martin dardis 
irwin? i really feel bad doing something like thisyou know that don't you?
they're worse that's why i quit
do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
that's another of the things i'm not so sure of
because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
we were never told flat out "don't talk" but the message was clear
to cover up?
well they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth
louder  they can't hear you
i will not talk about the other two
kalmbachnixon's personal lawyer
then barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to liddy who gave it back to me and i put it in the office safe which was crammed
routinei'd just call john mitchell over at the justice department and he'd say "go ahead give out the money"
we're moving  i've been looking for a job but it's been hard my name's been in the papers too much sometimes i wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence i'm not thinking of myself but my wife my parents it's been very rough on them
this'll only take one second
my wife just had the baby my in laws are arriving i'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape
it's gotta be haldemansomeone from the white house had to be involved
i'm not your source on that
let me put it this way: i'd have no problem if you did
i didn't mean to scare you like that
and we'll all have to go to work for a living
all nondenial denialswe're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate
christ i wish i knew if we should print this
you doublechecked both sources?
my nondenial denial
go on
it's not that we're using unnamed sources that bothers me or that everything we print the white house denies or that almost no other papers are reprinting our stuff
ben jesus there are over two thousand reporters in this town are there five on watergate? where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
you saying the democrats bugged themselves?
the fbi thinks it's possiblethe democrats need a campaign issue corruption's always a good one  get off the story benor put some people on mcgovern's finances; fair is fair even in our business
well you did
how senior?
you asking me to disclose my source?
i don't know titles
is he on the level of assistant to the president or not?
he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general
ok  you're about to write a story that says that the former attorney general the man who represented law in america is a crook  just be right huh?
his dialing finger must be falling off
what do you think?
he went to her apartment and he told her
i'm not sure it still feels thin 
give me some?
electronic surveillance
mitchell started the coverup early everyone is involved in the cover up all the way to the top the whole us intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities the extent of it is incredible  and people's lives are in danger maybe including ours
i'm not here
ok
clearly i am here but only as an individual i'm not the attorney of record  mr rafferty has that position whatever you want you'll have to get from him i have nothing more to say
look i told you inside
you have nothing more to say i understand that
i assure you there's nothing mysterious involved
probably you're right but a little while ago i was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars
so?
i'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street  you must be crazy julius
well they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel and that could only mean the burglars didn't arrange for their own counselthey never even made a phone call  so if they didn't ask for you to be here how did you know to come?
there is no reason to assume other people were involved
your clients were arrested with a walkietalkie; they didn't need that to talk among themselves
you're a lawyer and you're here
i met one of the defendants mr barker at a social occasion once  i have nothing more to say
a miami social occasion?  mr rafferty told me the cubans were from miami
barker's wife called me at three this morning; her husband apparently had told her to call if he hadn't called her by then
it was really nice of you to come since you'd only met him once
are you implying you don't believe me?
i have nothing more to say
whoa hold up li'l sis'  i done told you 'bout that  julius ain't my name you better recognize hopkins was our slave name  my true name is
you don't mind getting on people's nerves do you?
absolutelymarilyn's gotten it totally wrong
she's an awfully good reporteri can't remember her getting too much wrong before can you?
that's a bullshit question that's a question straight out of wichita kansas
sorry ken; listen one last thing: where did your talk with berger happen?
where?  what do you mean where?
well was it in a bar her apartment some restaurant
i've completely forgotten where it was except i know it wasn't her apartment
check?
the twentyfive thousand dollar one  the one with your name on it  in bernard barker's florida account  bernard barker the watergate burglar
stop it
i'm not callin you big black africa mommy and daddy named you julius
you're definitely doing a story?
yes sir
i'm a proper citizen i'm a decent man i don't do anything that isn't decent or proper  i know i shouldn't tell you this
i see and how do you think it reached miami?
i don't know; i really don't the last time i saw it was when i was in washington i gave it to the finance department of the committee to re elect the president how it got to that burglar your guess is as good as mine
that checks out with our finding thank you mr dahlberg
nothing that's the problemthe story's gone underground
you thought i'd help out on specifics?  i'll confirm what you get try to keep you on the right track but that's all  are you guys really working?  how much?
i don't know maybe sixteen eighteen hours a daywe've got sources at justice the fbi but it's still drying up
then there must be something mustn't there look forget the myths the media's created about the white house the truth is these are not very bright guys and things got out of hand
big black is the first name and africa is the last
if you don't like them why won't you be more concrete with me?
because the press stinks toohistory on the run that's all you're interested in  you come up with anything?
john mitchell resigned as head of creep to spend more time with his family that doesn't exactly have the ring of truth  howard hunt's been foundthere was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag
follow the money always follow the money
to where?
go on
this man gordon liddyhe's going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglarswe know he knows a lot we just don't know what
you changed cabs? you're sure no one followed you?
i did everything you said but it all seemed
melodramatic?  things are past thatremember these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city
i order out mostly  so what do i owe this visit to?
what's the whole thing aboutdo you know?
what i know you'll have to find out on your own
liddyyou think there's a chance he'll talk?
talk? once at a gathering he put his hand over a candle and he kept it there he kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared a woman who was watching asked "what's the trick?" and he replied "the trick is not minding"
ratfucking
in my day it was simply called the double cross i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck in our context it simply means infiltration of the democrats
i know what it meanssegretti wouldn't go on the record but if he would we know he'd implicate chapin and that would put us inside the white house
yes the little ratfuckers are now running our government
who?be specific how high up?
you'll have to find that out won't you
hook you up?  the maumau's?  you must be smoking  why in the world would i want to hook up a bunch of red black and green flagwaving pseudo revolutionairies?
the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking we've almost got that nailed down so
did you change cabs?  it didn't work something moved there
do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
they know but they focused on the burglaryif it didn't deal with the breakin they didn't pursue it
why didn't they?who told them not to?
someone with authority i'd imagine wouldn't you?  don't you know what you're onto? come on
mitchell knew then
of coursemy god you think something this big just happens? the breakin and the cover up of course mitchell knew but no more than ehrlichman
haldeman too?
you get nothing from me about haldeman?
so now i see where you're coming from  just because we ain't rapping about gucci timberland rolex benz cristal ho's and bitches we're pseudo
total manipulation i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution but they don't think along philosophical lines
talk about segretti
don't concentrate on segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too
there were more then
follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere
the canuck letterwas that a white house operation
don't you miss the grand scheme too
how grand?
nationwidemy god they were frightened of muskie and look who got destroyedthey wanted to run against mcgovern and look who they're running against they bugged they followed people false press leaks fake letters they canceled democratic campaign rallies they investigated democratic private lives they planted spies stole documents on and on don't tell me you think this was all the work of little don segretti
and justice and fbi know all this?
who are you revolting against?
yes yes everything there were over fifty people employed by the white house and creep to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief
fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats?
i was being cautious  you can safely say more then fifty
you've done worse than let haldeman slip away you've got people feeling sorry for himi didn't think that was possible a conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck you build from the outer edges and you go step by step if you shoot too high and miss then everybody feels more secure you've put the investigation back months
we know thatand if we were wrong we're resigningwere we wrong?
you'll have to find that out won't you?
howard hunt here
hi i'm bob woodward of the post and
yes yes what is it?
i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate?
we're revolting against the powers that be that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color  and we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the us of a
good god
james mccord
will you step forward sir 
security consultant
where?
government recently retired
where in government?
central intelligence agency
where?
the cia
please
i'm woodward
i think so
are you sure?
no
when will you be do you think? when are we going to know it all?
it may never come out
never? please don't tell me never  ben says you've found some wonderful sources
some justice department lawyers and an fbi man and some people from the committee to reelect yes ma'am
and the underground garage one  would i know him?
i couldn't say
if you were really down you would get us together with that boss of yours  what's his name again?
but it's possible
it is
you've never told anyone who he is?  but you'd have to tell me if i asked you  tell me
i would if you really ever wanted to know
i really want to know
nobody ever had too much
nobody gives a shit about the dahlberg repercussions
quit equivocating say what you mean  our story got government accounting to start an audit on creep's finances
this white house guy a good one a pro came up and asked what is this watergate compulsion with you guys and i said well we think it's important and he said if it's so goddamn important who the hell are woodward and bernstein?
ask him what he's really sayinghe means take the story away from woodstein and give it to his people at the national desk
delacroix
well i've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around wouldn't you say so?
absolutelyand that's all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting
well what if your boys get it wrong
you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarterstell me harry why should i be smiling?
as usual that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly  except  it wasn't local democratic headquarters it was national democratic headquarters  and  these weren't just any idiots these were special idiots seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying  a walkietalkie forty rolls of film cameras lock picks pensized tear gas guns plus various bugging devices  not to mention over two thousand dollars mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills
preliminary hearing at superior courthouse?
two o'clock work the phones 'til you go
that's everything bachinski had i think it's worth following up
don't know; who the hell's howard hunt?  it's probably nothing but check it out just go easy it could be crazy cubans
i did all right on mccord
maybe i should just ya knowturn to the cameras and say do you mind if we just work something out?
yeah him
then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr mccord is security coordinator for the committee to reelect the president otherwise known as creep?
the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats? what the hell does that mean?
mr john mitchell the head of creep says it means nothing  "this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity and we will not forget it or condone it"
you can't believe that
as a rough rule of thumb as far as i can throw bronco nagurski that's how much i trust john mitchell
lotsa hints
i can't sell hints to simons  you called everyone you know?  call someone you don't know
i would liken your query to being in russia half a century ago and asking someone "i understand who lenin is and trotsky i got too but who's this yokel stalin?"
who's colson harry?
the most powerful man in america is president nixon probably you've heard his name
what makes you think he would write a show about the maumau's
thanks harry  know anything about colson?
just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading "when you've got them by the balls their hearts and minds will follow"
hunt is colson's man  that's charles colson nixon's special counsel  they both went to brown university  hunt worked for the cia till '70 and this is on deep background the fbi thinks he's involved with the breakin
i never asked them about watergate i only said what were hunt's duties at the white house they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty
i think we got a white house consultant linked to the bugging
well sloan
woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the breakin thingabsolute page one stuff
in other words you got nothing you're thumbsucking
could develop
let me see what you get but don't jumpthe new york times thinks it's crazy cubans
c'mon why not?  the monkees had a show  look at all that other junk that's on tv  we got underground cult following
anyone but bernstein
howard
remember toronto harry
that was awhile ago
i don't get ityou were the one who wanted to fire him
i know i did but damnit howard  for the first time since i've known him i think he's really humping
political personal sexual anything at all against mitchell?
go over your sources again
harry weren't you just arguing the opposite way?
maybe i'm tense
so are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to delacroix or set up a meeting?  i'm talking 'bout me your only brother ya own flesh and blood hook a brother up youknowwhati'msayin'
one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes
according to white house personnel hunt definitely works there as a consultant for colson but when i called the white house press office they said he hadn't worked there for three months then the pr guy said the weirdest thing to me  "i am convinced that neither mr colson nor anyone else at the white house had any knowledge of or participation in this deplorable incident at the democratic national committee"
absolutely
can we use their names?
maybe to fire yousince you two started on this story the post stock has dropped what 50 percent?  and the word is some nixon people are challenging her tv licenses i'm not saying she's going on relief but i don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you
you think she wants us to ease up on the story?
i don't know but i don't think that's unreasonable either do you?
larry young a california lawyer
well and good but when will he say it on the record
he just did
that'swhati'msayin'  i'm not blowin' my young career brother or no brother for you or anybody else
my wife told me to expect you  as you know i haven't talked to the press
you handed out the money maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done
as opposed to the committee? the committee's not an independent operation everything is cleared with the white house i don't think that the fbi or the prosecutors understand that
the report on the cash in maurice stans' safe the three hundred fifty thousand that's true?
no it was closer to seven hundred thousand
and as treasurer you could release those funds?
when so ordered
we're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you but we know there were five 
haldeman  right?
i won't talk about the other two
there is a name a term for your kind the likes of you  back in slavery days you would be classified as a house nigga
one thing i'm not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to liddy how did that work?
badly  you don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscoveredi gave liddy the dahlberg check and he gave it to barker who took it to miami and deposited it
well when liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the breakin funds i went to the safe and gave himout of this whole fortunei happened to give him the same hundreds he gave mebanks have to keep track of hundreds if the money had been in fifties or if i'd grabbed a different stack there probably wouldn't have been any watergate story
a girl melissa
no none of those
of courseeverything they asked
i already get the post i don't need another subscription
no i'm a reporter i wanted to talk to you about the committee to re elect
the what to what?
you work there miss abbott
if you think i'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative  you got your ways to affect change i have mine  and i would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house
i'm not miss abbott

you know i've never got that shit what exactly constitutes third base?
but 
sorry i thought you were dead
no a <u>pact</u>  no money involved  this is more important than any bet  now here's the deal: we all get laid before we graduate
pontificated
separately we are flawed and vulnerable  but together we are the masters of our sexual destiny
their tigerstyle kungfu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it
certified ladies' man huh?
right  that gives us
exactly three weeks to the day
no  it's true  he isreally big

you were merciless  you didn't give a shit if you got me or not
that can be done
"stop beyond this passage lie the catacombs of paris: the exclusive domain of the dead"
after the revolution the paris cemeteries overflowed they dug up all the old bodies and brought them here seven million people mostly very poor
pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers
well they are french
right
let's go from both ends we'll cut him off
you too
andy
for god's sakes let me out
"fuck"? you think i don't know this word "fuck"? is that how you talk to policemen in america?
my world famous famous world arroz con pollo will be ready very soon
it bit me my leg jesus it's down there shoot it shoot it for christ's sakes
you on drugs? huh?
no i
shit
shhh be quiet man we're not alone 
shut up save your stories the only thing i want to hear is you begging for your life i want to see you suffer like they did  haha you're scared now eh? come on where's the scary monster now huh? ha ha we'll see who 
man i don't know what the fuck you're talking about
bullshit your uncle told you
my uncle's in a coma you moron
before the coma
hurry up i wanna watch hbo
he didn't tell me anything all he said was saint severin
or else what? you'll kill me?
no but i'll kill your fucking girlfriend
you'll never get the chance
bullshit you're bluffing
what you think claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
and you call me a moron
yeah okay just gimme a minute to freshen up
if you know about the church why ask such stupid questions?
hey i'm new here what do you want?
did we get our bill yet?
sure don't you?
go ahead serafine blow him away
cure? hahaha
why isn't it doing anything?
looks like he lied to you too
what?
oh shit no
that's not all  marcel  officer boulard was following you
oh no no
this is it's like a sick joke i 
yo check it  this is good and all that but one day soon i want to have much benjamins so i can have a nice crib and pay all my bills you hear me
but i don't remember anything i swear
i leave these open maybe something comes back to you
what about me?
my men think you died and floated away in the seine if i wanted to i could let them believe that  but that would be illegal
i know i'm andy mcdermott terrence's nephew
yeah well why did he hang out here? the cops said it's dangerous 
the cops it's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception exploring new states of psychic awareness
you think it's silly but do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
what?
he's on a new drug called zbh or "daydream" it allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming he is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time
chill i'm the brains behind this outfit
yeah well that's like really groovy and everything but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
yeah?
terrence and i came down here to do serious work for centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate
yeah well if i claw my face off just pack it in ice okay? jesus the cops were probably right my uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him
my god serafine's right it's time to go we'll talk soon
why the fuck would i do that?
yeah well what if it's the weekly world news
what? oh right you can see these guys too jesus 
it's chemistry andy nothing more mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine like chain reaction in the infectee there were not many biochemists working in the twelfth century but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to
uncle terrence
and i'm the feet
yes i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications it took a lot of trial and error but finally he got it: adenine dimethyloxide adm i call it adam but just before he was attacked he hid it
because gaston was after it
yes that sociopath he's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy to him adam is just a threat to the terror he holds over others to us it's salvation
that's what serafine is searching for without much luck i'm afraid if only we could speak with him but alas he's off in another realm close to death
i told him it wasn't ready
you sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
andy? andy is that you?
yeah look uncle terrence 
sort of
great but listen i need to know where you hid the adm?
yo you gotta show some patience you want me to snap my fingers and presto chango  you're an overnight sensation  son there is no such thing
the adm be careful andy it's very powerful how do you know about it?
i went to st severin church  now look 
the adm quickly where is it?
ahhh the wine cellar in a bottle of chateau margaux a metal cylinder don't don't  aaaah
yeah i finally "checked out" thank god but there's a bit of unfinished business
claude
i never thought i'd ask this of anyone andy but do me a favor and kill the evil sonofabitch will you?
that's mcdermott but yeah
right listen my uncle it's not serious is it? did he eat some bad snails? slip on the bidet? what?
how well did er do you know him?
i'm tired of waiting
not too well he taught at the sorbonne right? dad always calls him his "hippie brother" did some work with timothy leary i think and  is he is he going to die?
no the doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time but basically he is how you say a legume
legume? you mean a vegetable?
vegetable right my mistake it seems he was attacked by a maniac maybe two or three maniacs just after midnight yesterday they fled into the tunnels beneath paris that's all we know
what do you mean maniacs?
well here's what i think happened a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night why? perhaps he's making a few francs on the side the psychedelic drug market is big these days he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and like they say if you lie with dogs you get fleas
yeah well these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws
i can't believe this why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn animals that attacked my uncle?
andy it's not so easy there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris it's a whole other city crawling with drug addicts lunatics skinheads it's no man's land
just the name of this hospital st severin he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness
are you crazy?  the joint is crawling with cops now  you wanna go to rikers?  go to the hoosegow?
why would he pick this one?
i don't know there were others much closer he was religious?
not that i know
well when you're about to pop off what have you got to lose? thanks for your help
aaaaa get the fuck away from me
what are you so damn angry about? did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? huh?
no we can't that's the problem god knows it would beat hanging around with you
good man now can i have my arms back?
but this is class kid all the way what a way to go
don't worry in a few seconds you won't feel a thing
well who was it that taught me how to do that?  huh?
we was coming to see you
puking on yourself in midair is not a good death
yeah i know back to the eiffel tower  and what about you?
i'm telling you it's not drugs it's something more someth 
don't give me your black magic bullshit seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny american boy? do you have a motive?  do you have a weapon? or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
i told you these murders are not normal
i can't at midnight tonight he will kill again it's crazy
are you crazy? we have nothing let him go then watch him if you're right you can pick him up at midnight or maybe he'll lead you to the others just let him go
allo?
serafine? is that you? what's going on?
claude it's andy he's acting really weird i think something happened last night
if it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
god well don't let him go catch him
you fucking liar
oh did i hurt the little girl's feelings? well excusez moi i confess my desire for adm is quite "intense" so i deceived you and our poor friend terry  a competent technician but let's face it a bit naive "the great cure for lycanthropy" hmph he didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of adam until it was too late and even then he came rushing down to tell me as if i would be just as shocked ha
just a crazy call from a girl probably fucked up on drugs i wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual
what did she say?
something about a monster underground in the catacombs under place denfert
i need two tactical assault squads at place denfert immediately you can tell the commissioner it's a code red
but inspector this girl i wouldn't call her reliable
now
yes sir
we're starving
he says 
your uncle was carrying this the keys to his apartment are in there i talked to his assistant madame flocquet you'll be staying there a while?
okay so maybe you were right
hmmph at least now there's one person around here who doesn't think i'm crazy
merde
double merde
right little twerp thinks he's colombo
you never heard the story of saint severin driving the werewolves from paris?
you think that's what mcdermott was raving about in the ambulance?
what you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
dela i don't know 'bout this
i was showing sonya something   
what were you showing her?
how to read
i thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore
i know but i had to because   
it's where i've made my home but i do have something for you   
when you're older   
get on anastasia get on
no  i'm running <u>to</u>
i'm not sure but look  
well do something about it
but what if we can't ever find where we came from?
then you'll have to make your own home lots of people do
then come find me
i heard it from everyone who said i didn't hear it from them   do you know dmitri?
well i don't have any money   
good day
look i came here to get papers to travel to paris and  
she's quite right dmitri a man of my stature should not have to
i'm fine
who's sophie?
eureka
ah  the lady sophie the ravishing first cousin once removed from the empress we must convince sophie that you are the princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the empress  your grandmother i mean
i don't have a memory and i'm not a princess  even if i were  no one's ever going to believe it i'm not exactly
you must have
come out i can do alterations
you'll laugh
i shant
not you him
yes your highness
poor meetoo
yes your highness
some tap dancing some singing
cut it out vlad i'm not angry with you anymore  i know how much you needed the money
vlad stop acting this way you're my friend
no from now on i am your loyal subject  your highness by your leave?
i'm sorry    i'm  
that's quite a hard head you've got there boy
who are you?
what happened to your parents?
i don't know  i don't remember anything that happened before the revolution  
you know it's strange  anastasia's grandmother the dowager empress tatiana has been looking for anastasia since the revolution  why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
i don't know  i don't see what this has to do with me
where do i sign?
perhaps it's because she has amnesia too  can't remember  
i have my reasons
anastasia's grandmother is in paris  we're going to bring anastasia to her  in paris 
look  there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but come on    look at me
sorry  it's a reflex living in an orphanage if someone bothers you  you automatically come up swinging
i wasn't bothering you i was trying to wake you up
i was all out of dynamite
that's a good idea  a great idea  stretch your legs   stretch then that way
why?
trying to breathe
trust me  of course i still have to pitch it to my boss but we'll have an answer one way or the other
now just get off the train
huh?
no
you shouldn't have pushed us
you are the princess
natasha natasha feastavich but we called her nashie fooshie
it's the best fork of all
the dessert fork
it used to be a private yacht before the government took it over
it's not you  it's the dress
dela i'm aboard  as long as i get to hoof and get paid too
sad?
lost it feels lost this was hers?
yeah  well yours you still don't believe that you're the princess do you?
i know i must have had something to do with the palace  i've had little flashes of things  but being the princess? it doesn't matter as long as i find my home
well the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it you're lucky you don't remember the revolution  i never had much but what i did have  i lost
i'm sorry
hey it doesn't matter you gotta make your own way in the world don't be sorry for me i'm going to get what i want don't you worry
it's okay didn't hurt
yes  if i can't convince sophie i'll never be able to see tatiana
you'll convince her you have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong and beautiful  even if you forget a couple dates of family names  she'll know
you're ruthless
that's right  money turns the wheel
don't be
tell me it isn't true? tell me you didn't do this for the money
no well yes but
no i thought you believed in me it was all a lie
i'm glad you	did too
anya where are we?
i'll never let go
i don't know i don't want to hurt you
i remember something lost  i'm so confused oh please just tell me if you recognize me do you think i could have belonged to you 
things my hear used to know things it years to remember
to what?
don't worry about that now child it will all come back to you now that you're home
no it wasn't a bat i saw this horrible man  i remember him i think
no no child shush it's all right 
oh yes grandmama  i wait until i hear
no not about the ceremony anastasia  do you understand the choice you must make
no he just wanted to know you were happy
you'll have to become used to it child if you accept the crown
"if" i accept? of course i'm going to accept it's what i always wanted
is it? is this what you want?
you can't go back to find your home your home is in your heart in the future that you make for yourself
you're now mantan
and this is my future this is who i am
this is who you were exactly who you are is up to you
i don't know who i am i still don't know
yes you do you do
and we have found each other nothing will ever change that i am your family dear child but i may not be your home
oh my god  don't do that  feel my heart go ahead i'm dying here 
and what do you want my little ratwithwings?

mantan?  i don't even care as long as i'm dancing  which reminds me i need some new kicks
okay you're not gonna like this but well it looks like anastasia is  still alive
how do you know?
rodent's intuition how do i know? she looks exactly like her except she's taller which	is natural  of course my second cousin treplev  he never	grew looks like a little pepper shaker he was so cute 
i cursed then all
my aunt bella sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world  she used to hang right side up anyway she always said "curses were made to be broken" course she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks so it wasn't quite so profound
you'd lose your security deposit?
evil powerful beings  i have their power only if i contain them control them if they should all be released at once well 
oy not a road trip i get wagon sick you know that
bartok a question
i'm getting pneumonia i have a fever feel my forehead

what do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
she leads a charmed life that little one  someone is always there to save her in the palace as a child on the train and now  it's him
me? no rich food  it kills me ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
shut up
we will  we <u>have</u> to  come on vlad  she's out there
that was your dinner  i do hope there is no cabbage in paris
he's her?
look
ew    the honest type
would you have leaned over rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
you have to start getting into your character
"wake up your highness"  we should start getting used to saying it
what a world  a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'your highness"
royalty do not help people with their luggage
yes and i hate that in a woman
pray he's colorblind
ah let us begin
if i used the word "bleak" i would be optimistic
it worked in odessa
but it's not	the money vlad
are you feeling all right?
mantan
what do you mean?
dmitri  you must understand that once you take her to tatiana well it's over nothing can happen between you she's a princess and you're a commoner
watch me
she found her home maybe it's time i found one too
rasputin
i know i know  you thought i was dead that's how the history books will remember me  not as the ruler of all of russia which i should have been  but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be

is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
yeah but that's notthat's no good i want the whole thing
well i need grass and so do you
it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air  in fact i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial
well it ruins it for me if you have grass  because you know i'm like a comedian
m'hm

yeahwell i didn't start out spying ii thought i'd surprise yuh pick you up after school
yeahwell you wanted to keep the relationship flexible remember? it's your phrase
oh stop it but you were having an affair with your college professor that jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "contemporary crisis in western man"

do we have characters?  how about honeycutt snowflake rastus nigger jim sambo jungle bunny and how could we forget aunt jemima
i mean i tried everything you know iii put on soft music and my my red light bulb and
but the thing isi mean since our discussions here i feel i have a right to my own feelings i think you woulda been happy because uh uh i really asserted myself
the incredible thing about it is i'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and i'm getting screwed
i don't know though i feel so guilty because alvy is paying for it so you know so i do feel guilty if i don't go to bed with him but if i do go to bed with him it's like i'm going against my own feelings i don't know ii can't win
you know it's getting expensive my analyst for her analyst she she's making progress and i'm not making any progress her progress is defeating my progress
sometimes i thinksometimes i think i should just live with a woman
how can you say that? i mean  who said iiii said that you i and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome
that's sick
yeah i know it's sick but it's new you know you didn't say it couldn't be sick

yeah and gradually you get old and die you know it's important to make a little effort once in a while
don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
yeah she's got a greatlookin' fa a pat on the androgynous side but it's
tsch i know a relationship i think isis like a shark you know? it has to constantly move forward or it dies  and i think what we got on our hands  is a dead shark
well let's see now if it has my name on it then i guess it's mine
oh it sure has you know you wrote your name in all my books 'cause you knew this day was gonna come
well uh alvy you wanted to break up just as much as i do

you should be ashamed of yourself
sixyearold boys don't have girls on their minds
i want a hot young white director maybe the kid that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video
i did
tell the folks where you are today donald
why are you so hostile?
'cause i wanna watch the knicks on television
is that paul goodman? no and be nice to the host because he's publishing my book hi doug douglas wyatt "a foulragandbone shopof theheart"
commentary
oh really i heard that commentary and dissent had merged and formed dysentery
no jokesthese are friends okay?
hey you wouldn't believe this two minutes ago the knicks are ahead fourteen points and now  they're ahead two points
alvy what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
you're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?
what's fascinating is that it's physical you know it's one thing about intellectuals they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on but on the other hand  the body doesn't lie asas we now know
"whywhy do you always rreduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?  he said as he removed her brassiere"
there are people out there from the new yorker magazine my god what would they think?
don't get upset
dammit i was so close
i'm too tense i need a valium my analyst says i should live in the country and not in new york
well i can't li we can't have this discussion all the time the country makes me nervous there's you got crickets and itit's quiet there's no place to walk after dinner and uh there's the screens with the dead moths behind them and uh yuh got thethe manson family possibly yuh got dick and terry
okay okay my analyst just thinks i'm too tense where's the goddamn valium?
i can't
what
i just want you to meet him  keep an open mind
my head is throbbing
oh you got a headache
i have a headache
bad?
oswald and ghosts
jesus
well i'mi'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers
you catch dylan?
me? no no ii couldn't make it that ni mymy raccoon had hepatitis
you have a raccoon?
besides what does he know about negroes?
tsch a few
the only word for this is trans plendid it's transplendid
i can think of another word
he's god i mean this man is god he's got millions of followers who would crawl all the way across the world just to touch the hem of his garment
really? it must be a tremendous hem
i'm a rosicrucian myself
are you?
yeah
i can't get with any religion that advertises in popular mechanics look  there's god coming outta the men's room
it's unbelievably transplendid i was at the stones concert in altamount when they killed that guy remember?
probably nuthin' but that's why it's such a sexy way to go sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective  a black director y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  with this kid the possibilities are endless
yeah were yuh? i wasi was at an alice cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes
oh no no don't be tsch don't be silly you know  i'm startin' iti'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now
oh sex with you is really a kafkaesque experience
oh tsch thank you h'm
i mean that as a compliment
i thinki think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm you know to make up for empty areas in life
who said that?
uh oh i don't know it might have been leopold and loeb  hello oh hi uh no whatwhat's the matter? whatwhatwhat? you sound terrible no what sure i whatta yuh what kind of an emergency? no well stay there stay there i'll come over right now i'll come over right now  just stay there i'll come right over
he's screaming his opinions in my ear
like all that juliet of the spirits or satyricon i found it incredibly indulgent you know he really is he's one of the most indulgent film makers he really is
what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video?
key word here is "indulgent"
without getting well let's put it this way
what are you depressed about?
i'd like to hit this guy on a gut level
it's a narrow view
probably met by answering an ad in the new york review of books "thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in mozart james joyce and sodomy"  whatta you mean our sexual problem?
it's the influence of television yeah now marshall mcluhan deals with it in terms of it being aa high uh high intensity you understand?  a hot medium as opposed to a
what i wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure
as opposed to a print
i mean d he can give you do you hafta give it so loud? i mean aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? and and the funny part of it is m marshall mcluhan you don't know anything about marshall mcluhan's work
if spielburg can direct "the color purple" and "amistad" our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot
wait a minute really? really? i happen to teach a class at columbia called "tv media and culture" so i think that my insights into mr mcluhan well have a great deal of validity
oh do yuh?
yes
well that's funny because i happen to have mr mcluhan right here so so here just let me i mean all right come over here a second
tell him
this is uh shawn and uh bob and petronia
trigger
hey
right before his unamerican thing
yeah i love it there
i wanted to let you make up your own mind about him
that's good
that's exactly my point  has he even directed actors before in anything?
i'm not myself since i stopped smoking
oh when'd you quit smoking?
whatta you mean?
mean?
you stopped smoking sixteen years ago is that what you said? oh ii don't understand are you joking or what?
may i see your license please?
sure  just don'tdon't get angry you know what i mean? 'cause ii have  i have mymy license here you know it's a rented car and i've
pick up the license you have to ask nicely 'cause i've had an extremely rough day you know my girl friend
just give me the license please
since you put it that way  it's hard for me to refuse  have a i have a terrific problem with authority you know i'm it's not your fault don't take it personal
no  just meet the guy  that's all i'm asking  look i'll even let you choose your own musical director  you can have that
you're crazy
no i'm not we were walking off the tennis court and you know he was there and me and his wife and he looked at her and then they both looked at me and under his breath he said "jew"
alvy you're a total paranoid
wh how am i a paran? well i pick up on those kind o' things you know i was having lunch with some guys from nbc so i said uh "did you eat yet or what?" and tom christie said "no didchoo?" not did you didchoo eat? jew? no not did you eat but jew eat? jew you get it? jew eat?

no no no max that's a very convenient out every time some group disagrees with you it's because of antisemitism
dunwitty don't leave

a long time
so you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
oh yes
did you know the contractor?

i hate the sight of blood  you guys don't take prisoners

anouk isn't like a dog really  more like a small person  so is there anyone here for me?  no one looks new  who's that?
you don't want that  it's married and it's the neighbor
oh i think he's cute  how's the marriage part working out?
you're fucking desperate
like you didn't know  who invited the bimbo?
one guess
it's me peerless
absolutely
had a little help?
absolutely not
it has your ring
i'm not that good
the neighbors from hell  the kind that lay in wait  i'd rather move actually wouldn't i?  wouldn't i?
why last?
and how's the diva doing?
she's got great tits
she's a constant surprise
it's been a long time

the camera loves her  a great actress
with great tits  i'm going to ask her if i can touch them
no what?
the movie
oh she's really enjoying it  i think is mac okay?
i don't know what's going on  i don't care to guess  mac's really unhappy she isn't there that's all  she's no idea what she's playing not a clue
pull up a chair  oh excuse me this is my lady dot
who sally?
and you know it isn't rocket science this script  she can barely get the lines out  there was a scene last week  she sobbed through every take  i know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy joe  something's gone  you know that thing that was sally  that always surprised you  it's gone  i think she's scared  and that's death
i still think she sails above the rest i mean not like her early films  but those were all such great directors
mac's a pretty great director joe  he's a woman's director  and nothing's happening  course he won't fire her because of the friendship but it was discussed  he had to battle his studio to get her in the first place
what?
hey listen i love her  she's sophia's best friend  i never said any of this alright  i'll deny it on the stand  you guys are gonna have kids  that is so great  maybe that's what this is all about  maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore  you know adults don't do this for a living  you guys are gonna have your kids you'll be directing  one asshole in the family is enough  sophia knew that intuitively  look at clair clair's a mess  make sure she gets the epidural  forget that natural childbirth shit everything's going to be what it's supposed to be  "life is but a walking shadow  a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more" and speaking of me the role of leo in your film?

no no of course not  how old is she? twentyfuckingtwo?
skye  i'm so glad you're able to make itit's our sixth actually  you read the book again?  well no the ending to chapter sixit's just that it's not filmic we tried it in an earlier draft but it just wasn't filmic well sure we can absolutely look at that again  if you're coming from laurel you want to take sunset west we're just past will rogers state park  three blocks west of that you want to hang right  it's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left
no  go ahead  you're gonna be great
not that often  he was excited to see you
i'm going to throw up
i can't imagine anyone else playing genna
really?
i'll say as little as possible
you can never be too early or too thin
and joe's huge in europe  he's like a rock star in london  his novels sell millions
who'd like to go and find otis?
okay  last one to find otis is a smelly old bum
it's taken care of
it's alright  be our guests
so he drank himself into a stuper?
panes is not on your team anymore
you've got cal  you've got gina  you've got skye?  we're the leftovers
okay knock it off
truce?
truce
dinner  don't be angry
i'm not fucking angry for god's sake
whatever  you know how he gets  well he went absolutely bonkers  lucy and i were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and i didn't fit any more it was almost fatal  and that my dear friends is the day
it's ecstasy sal
i'm worried about my spine  i'm very worried about my brain and my spine
the drinking is for the pain  it doesn't kill it just dulls it
oh for fuck's sake  nobody uses that gate
listen to yourself  don't worry it's alright  we'll find him  what's wrong with you?
she left the fucking gate open
well he can't have gone far
can't have gone far?  he's like a greyhound  he could be miles away
he'll find his way back
there are fucking coyotes out there
sally calm down  we're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical
or shitty  otis
otis
so what's up with you?
otis good boy come here  oh my god oh my god oh my god
this is a nightmare  we should have kept him upstairs
it was done  when sophia put the kids to bed america brought otis in the room and closed the door  it was done
well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate
oh fuck you and fuck monica while you're at it  but i guess that's what i interrupted
jesus sally  you are a medical miracle the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier
yeah let's talk about that  you seem to be rather an expert  i don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties
rave parties?  that's so typical  you would think it was called rage  perfect
what else don't i know about joe?  let's get really clear here
sally so i took a few pills  i went out dancing  i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you  i haven't lied to you  i told you about the people i've slept with  i just didn't mention the few occasions i took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental i knew i'd never hear the end of it and you have so little faith and so little trust in me  sally we're back i love you  trust that  please let's not do this
i was a hostess at this club your daddy was performing and i had never laughed so hard in my life he asked me to come with him  i quit my job and we've been together ever since
otis  come  good boy  come
otis
i'm not sure we understand that word in the same way
love?
you walked out on a five year marriage
that hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love  it's whether we can live together like this  all the time
it's not like this all the time
do i want anyone else?  no  do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  i'm trying
and how hard it hit?
just stop right there sally  we've been through this
your father is proud of you
you've been through it  that's how you love people  when it's easy for you when it's convenient for you
sally first of all you're talking bullshit  and second
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week  she's a fucking mess joe  your sister is a fucking mess  she needs you  i talk to her more than you do
that is not true
it is true  you know how you love joe? you dedicate a book to someone
every novel i've had published in every language i've dedicated to lucy
right  and when was the last time you spoke to her?
it's a novel
about me
who the fuck do you think you are?  the part of genna is not just about you it's about every woman i've ever loved in my entire life  including my mother the character is also clearly in her early twenties sally
he did the best way he knew how junebug is stubborn just like you
what are you saying?
hello?  last birthday was?
i don't look my age joe
sally i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it  and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently
it's a shit novel anyway
well there you go  i let you off the hook  you're one goddamn lucky actress
not really  i mean your books have always been pop but this is the shallowest of the bunch  that's what all our friends think anyway
okay  if we could've by some miracle stripped ten years off your face still couldn't have got the thing made because i don't mean anything as a director and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore  and the people that can hire you are afraid to because they think you're phoning it in  that you don't have oh christ sally
who?  who?  who thinks that?
your director and your costar of your current movie  don't dish if you can't take it sally
why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting?
mac?  mac says it?  cal?
sally for christ's sake
anyone else?
this is insanity  sally
don't
don't push me away
i had an abortion two weeks ago
don't do this
i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me
don't do this
nobody told me anything
i told you when we met i never wanted children  i don't want kids in my life we talked about it  you weren't listening
you changed your mind
i wanted you back
what?  you aborted our child?
i'm a monster  exactly
you're not ready
don't make allowances  i'll never be ready  some people just shouldn't have children  i'd be a terrible fucking mother joe  i did want it for us  but i couldn't do it  i don't really think i can do it
i wasn't part of that picture at all was i?  i wasn't part of that decision  did i occur to you at all?  it's a fucking farce  it's a fucking farce  how long did you think you could keep it going you're amazing  do you have any idea what you've done to us?
yes
i'll never forgive you
what good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
i know
i have no idea who you are
everybody hates the messenger
i'll be with you
i don't want to go tonight
you don't have to
okay
pretty much a disaster tonight wasn't it?
i guess
life gets messy  ugly messy  but i don't understand you  and i don't think i ever understood lucy  i don't understand throwing it away  how do you throw all that away?  any of it  i want it all  you guys want guarantees?  i want the possibilities  and all kinds of crap comes with that  a lot of bad shit and i think that's okay with me because because of the rest of the stuff  all the good shit  all the surprises  it's a fucking miracle when you come down to it  we'd have had amazing children you and me  we'd have had a ride  you'd have surprised yourself  i'll never love anybody else you know
no  no listen to me here  i want to know what you're talking about  you know the shoe thing and the marriages and
it wasn't my fault  if i would have known i would have known
me too
that's under lock and key
me too
it's a calder
i know
he's my favorite
i know  it's for the baby's crib
ah
oh sally mae
will you make love with me?
manray
sure
oh you know i am
has she called?
she'll never call again  she called last week to tell me she'll never call again where's sally?
come on panes
sure
i'll do it
thanks i'll take that  champagne?
lovely
nothing that can't be exchanged
it hit me like a ton of bricks
oh  well  good
congratulations on the deal  how exciting  is sally doing sally?  i mean it's sally  the character that's based on sally  the character that's based on sally in the book
the novel  no skye davidson is playing the lead
oh my god i'm a huge skye davidson fan she's very beautiful
yes she is
but i am right yes?  she's based on sally
it's a novel
still  well  let's drop it
yes
i'm not much of a reader but i do love autobiographies even biographies sometimes  mostly nonfiction  did you read the new styron?
how can this be?  you and me at the same time the exact same thought it's scary
no
it's very good  i understand you won the booker prize
yes i did
is your script much like the novel? jerry says it's very good  but you know you read the novel and then you see the movie  and most of the time you say "what's this?" you know?  i sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all  because we come with expectations and of course we know where we're going  don't you find?
don't i find what?
i don't know why joe we've known each other how long
not long
don't be silly
joking
yes i know  i started to say i started to say joe that 
the idea was out there in the universe  now what?
do i put you off?
you manage to throw me off balance  i adore you
and i you
but i'm always afraid i'll say something stupid
ah
and so i always manage to do you see? like the book/script thing do you see?
mmm hmmm
he's the best dog in the world  they're both coming tonight  not my idea
ours
it's jerry's worst idea
do you know how you will use him?
ah there's our snookums now
what?  oh yeah the camera man?  they gave me a list
and you got skye davidson  pretty big leagues for a first timer  do you even like movies?
not particularly  weird isn't it?  god i'm rally up  do you feel anything yet mac?
kind of  hey look  john seale oliver stapelton darius khonji  they're friends  and great dp's i could give them a call for you
thanks mac  and thanks for being so supportive about all this  i really love you you know
hey i'm happy for you buddy  anything i can do
god i really need to jump about a bit  how's your film going?
i meant sally
i meant sally
not yet but this thing will never get made
oh  you're serious
no  no  let me tell you something  directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood  the sleep depravation alone
oh don't  everyone says that
no he's absolutely right  you're absolutely right ryan  dog talk must be banned  canine conversations are completely discouraged it's really good of you to join us  can i get you a drink?
right away  are you sure you wouldn't like something soft ryan?
you're an interior decorator right?
sally did all this herself?
in fits and starts  and then later of course she had to accommodate me  so things shifted a little bit then became more eclectic  and it keeps changing
mmm  it says something about the two of you maybe
yeah we're in a constant state of flux  i see you've moved up from the soft stuff
dunwitty wants a coon show  and that's what i'm going to give him it's going to be so racist so negative he won't have the balls to put it on the air  hence i'll prove my point
oh yes  you know ryan's been sober eight years  and it's difficult if i you know  it's better if i don't
uhhuh
i'm a little nervous so
oh
a little out of my element
no you're not
well yes  yes in fact  a little on the outside yes  and there's been all this friction
hm
i don't know why but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating
very well put
what point is that?
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort
what?
but you're very private people  you know there's a kind of elitism
elitism?
the wrong word maybe  delete that and you know the dog barks incessantly
and you know he really does not
and ryan works at home
and your phone calls are nasty and abusive  and i've come this close to suing you for harassment  and you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you
well that's what ryan thought  i was more generous actually
oh shit  i'm sorry  i'm a total fucking maniac  delete all that okay?  i spoke for myself this needn't rub off on my wife  oh shit  i get pissy sometimes much worse than otis  otis doesn't bite it's just i really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot we live in a canyon  we hear dogs barking at night too  and it's not otis
the point being that him the networks don't want black people on television unless they are buffoons
alright  please don't tell ryan i'm drinking
scout's honor
i'll be your best friend
we're way past inappropriate
i will treasure this
sally
i don't think so  i feel  i feel a bit funny
let's go for a walk
oh?  it's easy  you just put one foot in front of the other that's a good girl
i'm a little in the puke zone
i'll tell you tonight  let's do it tonight  as soon as you get back we'll talk  we'll talk
sounds risky to me
here drink this  drink lots of water  hold on to this  take deep breaths nice and slow  would you like a lolly?
what am i five?
you're never too old for a lolly  i'm having one
okay
lemon
lemon it is
i think he's really angry with me too
it's really not the same thing  he was really nicer when he drank
i'm sorry
eight years though  that's quite an accomplishment
you getting cold feet?
that's a lot of those
medallions
a lot of cakes
yes
and he doesn't smoke?
he has to find nonsmoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible you know? it's gotten much better
how long have you been married?
ninenine yes?  nine years just about
you must have been a baby
oh yes  nineteenjust  i'm cold
i'm in till the end
come here
i like you
i'm so glad  you know i recognize that passage in your book  the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre
sorry?
i know you changed it to a bookstore and the color of my hair  but the moment was exactly the same  the same you know dynamic  and almost verbatim wasn't it?
yeah it was  for a writer nothing's sacred  no nothing at all
i think it's great that i made an impression at all you know
i'm so sorry
it was a mistake  this isn't a plot to do in otis
oh i love that  i'm just great  i'm so happy to be here and i apologize for invading you  and i'm so happy you asked me to  i'm so touched  i know how private you and sally are
good  i'm going to need your support
yeah well it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends
when i read your work i felt that you knew me  women must tell you that  and this one in particular speaks to me do you know?  i am genna  how many women must tell you that  and the script is wonderful  wonderful and lean and visual
i'm so happy you like it  i'm so relieved you said yes and i'm really um what thrilled yes actually to finally meet you
you're going to be a remarkable director a brilliant director
this is an amazing present  what a sweetheart you are
clair is a hovering mother
trust him
time
no it's not fuck fuck fuck fuck
wellwow
can't you just quit?  walk away?
not good
i'm sure you understand
he always has two or three going
you know what sally therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  she didn't pull that out of thin air  it causes brain damage  you'd better drink a lot of water
do you want to go home ryan?
yes
i think you should then  you should look in on sheila
i'm not going to leave you alone
they're really nice people ryan they're like us
they're nothing like us
and lose out on my money?  the only way i get paid is if i get fired and that's what i intend to do
i think you need to speak for yourself ryan  but i think you're really nice people
there's only you ryan  you know what ryan?  you're beautiful  i love you so much you need
i don't need a drug
you need a good review and you'll be fine  the whole color of the world will change mark my words
i'm going to go get my swimsuit  i do know ryan this is non addictive so you mustn't worry  ryan you're a great man
you're not serious
i left the gate open and otis got out he could get hit by a car
god willing
we have to find the dog ryan
why?
manray better not be bleeding to death  i need him  after we're done he can do whatever he wants to do until then he's ours
because we're nice people and because what goes around comes around  because god help you if something happens to that dog?
excuse me?
all the ugly phone calls?  we're not the only people with a tape recorder ryan  they've gone to the canyon we should go towards the pch
don't go in ryan
what?
let's just go home okay?
sally?
yes  and you've met joe
oh?
are you working on a new book?
this is cheeba
yes great  it's a beautiful house
thank you  i understand you're an interior decorator
yes
i so wish i'd known
well whoever did this is amazing
i did it
there's a goddamn sign on the gate
i'm so sorry
you fucking cow can't you read?
i
i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer
how long ago was it?
i'm in the same room with sally nash  oh my god  you're my icon  i've been watching your films since i was a little girl  like four years ago i followed you all around the beverly center  at least half a day working up the courage to introduce myself
not at all
oh my god  i've been so rude  i'm skye davidson  has anyone ever told you you look like peter sellers?
no never
yes
do you need anything else?
no no thanks
oh?
the charades
my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show
thank you
that was my clue
oh?
the shostakovich
really??
oh yes indeed  that was my clue you see
not to mention andrew zhdanov otis come
andre zhdanov?  how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov?
who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music  shostakovich prokofieve and myaskovsky
i'll tell you who doesn't know cute girls don't know
promise?
why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
do peter sellers again
otis you crazy dog  otis are you in this god forsaken canyon?  my people are very hungry
i just did a movie about bob yar i played gittle the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head and they used shostakovich's 13th symphony
set to the poem of yetveshenko
exactly  so i dug it and i did a lot of research
do you really you really like shostakovich?
yeah
would you like marry him?
if he were still alive maybe
how about someone who really really liked shostakovich?
it was the principle  dunwitty had to be enlightened  i was making a point  i take pride in my work plus i already told you i wasn't gonna walk away from my money
are you asking me to marry you?
no i'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are
very
oh good i'm worse are you really twentytwo?
who told you that?  no  i'm twenty  five
it's a machine gun  i thought i'd kill myself
are you lovesick?
suicidal  it's much less codependent
will champagne help?
not enough
fuck da money  why do through all this effort?  why?  are you looking for love from dunwitty?  for respect?  dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you  so now what are you gonna do?
oh great
really?  i need a drink  come hide with me
you don't know she's a bitch
she's all over him are you blind?
it could be worse
how?
she could be playing the role in joe's movie that should be yours
fuck you panes
you see that's worse
i just wanted tonight to be with the people we love
what's the chances of mantan being picked up?
like your business managers?
they're not just our business managers panes
oh okay forgive me  your neighbors are here for fuck's sake
exactly what i mean  it's all ruined
it's not ruined for fuck's sake  it's one of your parties
i don't want it to be just one of our parties
"how are you really doing panes?" "lousy thank you i'm falling apart"
like the last time
no  no not like the last time  she was the rest of my life
like the last time
i wouldn't bet against it  my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place
i wasn't finished
okay
"we can't stand seeing you like this panes  i hate you being alone  why don't you stay with us for a while?" "i'd love to thanks"
it's our anniversary panes
i didn't hear me say tonight
we're just feeling our way back
"otherwise we'd insist on your being here"
you know it's true
i'm levi panes  will you excuse us skye?  it's time for sally's meds
i'd cut off her red wine if i were you
like i said all this for some twisted distorted sense of principal  dunwitty he just tolerates your negroidal ass he doesn't respect it
shit  it's my galiano
what does that mean?
about five thousand dollars  with my discount
why don't you go fuck yourself?
no  really  for real  really
i'm worried about your galiano
you're a shit
no really five thousand with your discount
yes  fine
that's it?  yes  fine?
hello
i don't want to talk about it
why not?
i never like to talk about my work
alright  well that's something new
no  not something new
well something's wrong
nothing's wrong  it's great okay? having the time of my life  mac's a fantastic director  and what can anyone say about cal that hasn't been said  and it's great working with friends blah blah blah

cal knows who he is  did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
you weren't exactly horrified
i don't have a drug problem
neither does joe
his sister does  big time  and the new york times says addiction is genetic  i'll email you the article
we're fine  we're great  we're having a baby and we're moving to london

not nice  not kind
ha  not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel
what do you want me to say?
why are you doing this?
his image of you is a possessive fragile neurotic
but i am a possessive fragile neurotic
no you are not  you're sally nash listen to me you're sally nash  you're my best friend and i love you more than anyone and you're not going to move to london to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent manchild  "oh now i'm a novelist oh now i'm a director" english prick bastard joe therrian who's probably going to leave you for skye davidson anyway
z old pal  shut up  it's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day
the squeaky wheel gets the oil
no z  the squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u> alright?  you're a good ant z even though you are a pain in my rear segment  i don't wanna see anything happen to you  so quit mouthing off before you get in trouble
thank goodness  breaktime
this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground  why are we even digging this thing?
who cares z  all i know is we gotta dig  we're not the ones in charge
just don't lie to me
i'm newi was born yesterday
tell me about it
nobody told me digging was so much fun  you pick up the dirt you move it you pick it up again you move it again  lots of repetitions you exercise the forceps and the pincers 
mmm yes i see what you mean
sorry i got you in trouble  but listen you can share my rations
are you asking me out to dinner?
no  i mean yes  i mean  if you don't have other plans
i'll make myself availablelisten better watch out with the backtalk  i don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me  i'm afraid he got <u>downsized</u>
z?  <u>our</u> z?  the little guy made it
that's right  he slaughtered hundreds of termites singlehandedly
the pleasure is mine
invisible
no  an <u>individual</u>
rightbecause every ant's important
very well  carpenter is there a convenient time to talk visavis: relationship?
well  i declared war
ohand i was afraid we had nothing in common
it's a shame he died prematurelyi was hoping to kill him myself
well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now  i miss him already
you miss him?  <u>why</u>?
becausebecause he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are  i could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you  i'm  i'm an <u>individual</u> and when i get married it'll be to someone <u>i</u> choose
c'mon  you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family  you gave your brother a shot  that's all anybody can ask for an opportunity a chance a shot  he got his
wanna dance?
i work in the palace i don't get out much
the palace hunh?  i bet those royals really live it up  of course they're all a little you know from inbreeding 
<u>what</u>?
well actually uh  i'm sort of making it up 
really?
why should everyone dance the same way?  it's as exciting as watching fungus grow
you're right
you  you think i'm right?
why can't i just do whatever i want to do?  why can't i just go wild? yahoo
i'm sorry i can't help it  it's too funny
oh that's okay i'll let him off this time  are you crazy?  this guy's built like a pebble  you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays 
aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
wait  when can i see you again?
let me think  hmmnn  never  bye
well if singlehandedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero yes i am
i'm princess bala
ah yes  well charmed i'm sure  so princess have you ever danced with a hero?
yes
ohoh well then one more won't matter
uh sorry general ii've always had this animal magnetism it 
everybody shut up

no weirdlyyou remind me of someone
noas a matter of fact
oh my god it's you  you're a worker  a filthy stupid disgusting worker
i can't dance with a worker
that's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> 
quiet  sshhh
 at the <u>worker bar</u>  you were pretty hot to trot then
sshh  sshh
how should <u>i know</u>?
yeah  i'll do that  as long as you're not patronizing me
a small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing
i order you to find out where we are
alright alright i'll try to get directions from one of the locals
climb up that tree and get a better view
who's the bigger idiot  the idiot who gets kidnapped or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
how dare you speak to me like that? i'm the princess
of course  it defines society  to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself
but can there be a society composed of just two ants?
no  there's no such thing as "just two ants"  you never see just two ants  you see a million ants
look around sweetheart
well i guess that makes us even
a gift
ha  don't make me laugh  you're crazy about me  that's why you lied and cheated to get near me
oh come on <u>you're</u> the one who came after me  the swarthy earthy sensual worker
i was <u>slumming it</u>  i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place
is that the same standard you used to choose general formica?
i <u>didn't</u> choose him  what kind  of <u>idiot</u> would  <u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
well that's an appealing offer butconsidering the options  you go back  me i'm going to insectopia
<u>insectopia</u>?  you stupid worker that's just a fairy tale
yeah well i have it on a reliable source  that it exists  now you follow the yellow egg  <u>that</u> direction
worker  come back here now
i've got a <u>name</u>  it's <u>z</u>
for what?
that's not a name  that's just a letter
waterwater  oh you already said that
my skin's dry my exoskeleton is crackingi wish i'd never met you you ruined my life
<u>i</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  look i was perfectly happy until i met you  alright i was miserable but i was <u>happily miserable</u>
come on  it's gone  what are the chances of that happening again?
want a list?
wait i hear something
cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap
listen "princess" you can't order me around  out here you're not the boss anymore  out here you're just 
hlllllllp
no matter what you think you did come up with something unique open it
stop fooling around in there
general formica won't let me die out here  i'm his fiancee
look  how many other princesses are there?
five thousand three hundred and ninety  no  about five thousand four hundred by now
and only you can become a queen?
wellno but 
so what makes you so special?
welli <u>am</u> the oldest
come ontell me there wasn't just a littlesomething between us that first night at the bar  the night we danced
what difference does it makewe're both going to starve to death or get squished or set on fire
this is authentic not a repro circa turn of the century
you were rightyou were right  z it's <u>beautiful</u>
let's dig in
yes?
<u>this is all your fault</u>
forget it  you go ahead i give up ii don't know what i was thinking "insectopia"
just looking for fun adventure trouble i guess
well "trouble" is my middle name actually my  middle name is 985 but i don't tell people  hey bala ii actually have something of yoursyou left it at the bar that night
you held onto this all that time?
well ii know it's a little strange buti thought it might come in handy if ineeded a scarf someday  well to be honest i just liked having it
there's something going on z 
thanks
oh no
i know it's crazy but  i can't just leave  don't argue with me  if i've learned anything it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world  or beans  something like that  anyway i've <u>got to warn the others</u>
a <u>few</u>?
there isn't anyplace else   except the worker bar
the worker bar  yes  that's where i want to go
i'm the princess aren't i?
of course 
and do princesses do improper things?
of course not 
then if i go to the worker bar it isn't improper  anyway don't worry no one will recognize us in our disguises
i thought it was appropiate
it's just that  well i'm honored that you selected me and everything i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if  we had a conversation?
you did?
yes  but i did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings  the wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged  even marriage  you're lucky  general formica is a paragon of anthood
yeshe's wonderful
darling you must encourage the troops  wave
mom
i just joined up  but i'm quitting i got a trial membership
trial membership?  kid when you join this ant's army you're in for the full hitch
yeah  well  no  she's kind of playing hard to get  as a matter of fact she's playing completely unattainable  so what's on the schedule?  a brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
no  we're going to attack the termites
is that good or bad?
attack?  but  i hate attacking it's so hostile
our platoon has the best assignment of all  we're the first into battle
superior numbers kid
maybe they went out for the evening let's leave them a message and head home
don't get all sappy about it
barbatus?
be honest kid  am i hurt bad?
no no you'relookin' good you've got good color in your cheeks
no  i can see it in your eyes  i'm a goner  it's alright z  in this ant's army a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus  i can't feel my legs
hang in there buddy  you can make it  just  take deep breaths i'll try and find your body  it's gotta be around here somewhere
it's all good  you got a hit show you're gonna need a bank  plus i love these old black collectibles
i wonderwhatwas it allfor
barbatus hang on  barbatus
don't make my mistake kid don'tbe a gruntyour whole life
princess  you look  outstanding is there anything i can do for you?
outstanding  princess?
duty calls
i've never seen anything like it general they're they'rewell look
well uh who notices workers sir?
no one should have to  have him brought to me
scattered reports sir  rumors nothing reliable
how so?
desperate times call for desperate measures  get me ant team six
ant team six
uh actually we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir
yeahi meanwelli don't know really sir
well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality have you?
oh no sir
good  you're a good soldier
thank you sir
ii have no idea sir
okay son
no you didn't  if you really thought i could make my own decisions you would've let me go out with him instead of helping daddy hold me hostage
patronizing you nay i love you
to me it shows part of our history in this country a time when we were considered inferior subhuman
that's correct sir
not that one  or that one
no sir
now i've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>  well you boys are gonna be taken care of  but in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u> we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u> and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>
geez and i forgot my toothbrush
dammit i'm proud to be an ant  and i know each and every one of you boys will do your duty  dismissed
damn i'm proud of you boy  i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber the world would tremble  now time for some r and r  you're invited to the royal victory party
royal victory party?  willwill princess bala be there?
of course  the entire royal family will be there to honor you
one to nothing
i don't want to hear it
well i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back  so tell me fellow warmongerdo you think princess bala likes men in uniform?
well she better  she's engaged to one  <u>me</u>
engaged?  as in you're getting married?
affirmative
soyou two are in love?
in love?  i'm just a plain old soldier at heart  i'll tell you what i love  the field  blood  death  ordersand the company of other warriors
yes and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
not enough food?
negatory  <u>too many ants</u>  and while we soldiers go out there and fight and bleed and die for the colony the nambypamby workers live it up back home
i tell you son sometimes at night i see myself in battle fighting a horrible faceless enemy with the future of our whole species at stake and always the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart
how long have you and hambone been hangin' out?
oh hey that's great i think i see an old war buddy over there it's been fun chatting  good luck with the hallucinations
oh of course 
well it wasn't a masquerade really it was more what i'd call a clever ruse 
arrest him
can't we all settle this like adults  we're not larvae anymore 
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory
yes what else?
please don't worry your majesty leave the worrying to me  as you know i'm not an ant of half measures  i don't pussyfoot around this crisis is my number one priority and i promise you it's being dealt with swiftly and decisively
i do not recollect your majesty will that be all?
yes general formica  carry on my good man  i don't know what we would do without you
you're the one that put us together we're friends
look general  a darling baby soldier  don't try to be a hero  just make sure you come back in one piece  next
i'll take your suggestion under advisement princess  in the meanwhile 
they should be  but there's something funny about that soldier
but general  this tunnel is your baby  you're sure you can't stay ?
'fraid not your majesty  goodbye your majesty
very well general  i know you  all work and no play
alright let's move out
terrific  you <u>should</u> feel insignificant
yes  you know people ask me "doctor why are you always happy?" and i tell them it's mind over matter  i don't <u>mind</u> that i don't <u>matter</u>  do you get it?  do you get it?
why are we so successful?
that crazy brother of yours doesn't think so
i'm glad you asked me that question
ants
right  ants  millions of creatures each with his assigned task all pulling together
but  but i've always felt life was about finding meaningand then sharing it with someone special someone you love
i'll be back
i don't know what you're talking about z
come on  everybody dumps on us workers  you soldiers get all the glory  plus you get to go out into the world meet interesting insects and kill them
yeah but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes
who said there was a girl for you? i was talking about a girl for me  don't you want your aphid beer?
i can't help it  i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature  call me crazy
he's just playing big brother
z we've known each other a long time right?
of course  you were born two seconds after me
and all the time i've known you you've been grumping and groaning you should quit making waves  go with the flow
weaver i'm an insect not a liquid
poor guy's had one too many scouting missions
i'm not in the mood  even when they're off work they follow orders
well you just sit here and be a partypooper
are you kidding?  there were sparks between us  this scarf is a sign
it's a sign that you're crazy  do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
what's gonna go wrong?  i take your place for the royal inspection  bala comes strolling down the line she sees me  <u>bingo</u>  love is rekindled and she takes me up to the palace for a little  tea and crumpets and you take your place again and go march around to your heart's content
oh is he?  you getting jiggy with mantan?
i can't think of any
well i'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you
will you introduce me to some worker girls?
you bet  they'll really go for a sensitive guy like you
maybe i'll get lucky  you know z i wouldn't do this for anyone but you
you're a real buddy
yeah i know
what do i do?
don't tell anyone you're a worker follow that column over there  and come right back after the inspection
you heard the ant  dig
please don't go there
my mother
that's sweet  that's real sweet
yeah  how much?
i mean  barging in on your mother  in the middle of the night?
don't worry about the old lady one squawk from her and she's out of a job
under the mat? 
that's right  maria ouspenskaya blonde  hiya ouspenskaya
something the matter?
i seem to have dropped my key  oh  here it is
oh you don't have to worry about that  nothing in there that anybody would want to steal  good night mrs dreyfuss
dunwitty and i feel you've been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up
eggs he asks me for oranges what you need is a good horsewhipping
ma'am?
from me the doctor has no secrets poor girl  how could you do a thing like that?
i didn't really do anything  honest  i mean you take a girl out a couple of times a week  just for laughs  and right away she thinks you're serious  marriagewise
big shot for you i wouldn't lift a finger  but for her i'll fix a little something to eat
well i have some paper towels 
beatnik go to my kitchen  third drawer under the good silver there is napkins
yes mrs dreyfuss he starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two fran is just sitting there the spoon in her hand not touching the soup
so what are you waiting for  a singing commercial?
one napkin coming up  i wish we had some champagne to wrap it around
i can't lie to him  if he asks me something i tell him what i think
what did i tell you?
look mrs dreyfuss you don't have to wait around i'll wash the dishes and 
you wash 'em you break 'em i'll come back for them later  if he makes trouble give me a yell
sheldrake?
she's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes they want you up stairs
oh
care to make a small wager?
i've been here twice as long as you have 
shall we say  a dollar?
it's a bet
i love you
do you have to be so damn forthright?
morning miss kubelik
it was making me nervous so i chopped it off  big mistake huh?
i sort of like it
yeah  i better not get too close
oh i never catch colds
really?  i was looking at some figures from the sickness and accident claims division  do you know that the average new yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
that makes me feel just terrible
why?
well to make the figures come out even  since i have no colds a year  some poor slob must have five colds a year
that's me 
light?
i should have stayed in bed last night
you may not realize it miss kubelik but i'm in the top ten  efficiencywise and this may be the day  promotionwise
you're beginning to sound like mr kirkeby already
why not? now that they're kicking me upstairs 
couldn't happen to a nicer guy  you know you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator
really?
the characters you meet something happens to men in elevators must be the change of altitude  the blood rushes to their head or something  boy i could tell you stories 
i'd love to hear them maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime  or some evening after work 
i hope so  wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this  with my cold and everything   how do i look?
fine  wait
that which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light  this bucket of blood
good night
i almost didn't recognize you  this is the first time i've ever seen you in civilian clothes
how'd you make out on the twenty seventh floor?
great look  have you seen the music man?
no
would you like to?
sure
i thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first  and then 
you mean tonight?
yeah
you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody  i know where i made my big mistake  i have a general rule never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you
i'm sorry but i can't tonight i'm meeting somebody
oh  you mean  like a girlfriend?
no like a man
just tell 'em  now and then
this date  is it just a date  or is it something serious?
it used to be serious  at least i was  but he wasn't  so the whole thing is more or less kaputt
well in that case couldn't you  ?
i'm afraid not i promised to have a drink with him  he's been calling me all week 
oh i understand
what time does the show go on?
that's why it will be so much fun
eightthirty
well  i could meet you at the theatre  if that's all right
all right? that's wonderful it's the majestic  44th street
meet you in the lobby okay?
how is your cold?
what cold? and after the show we could go out on the town   i've been taking from arthur murray
so i see
they got a great little band at el chico in the village  it's practically around the corner from where you live
sounds good  how do you know where i live?
oh i even know who you live with  your sister and brotherin law  i know when you were born  and where  i know all sorts of things about you
the first and only time  a big mistake  i'm gonna have to ask you not to see mantan anymore
how come?
a couple of months ago i looked up your card in the group insurance file
oh
i know your height your weight and your social security number  you had mumps you had measles and you had your appendix out
eightthirty
thank you  i thought you were avoiding me
what gave you that idea?
in the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once  and then you didn't take your hat off
well as a matter of fact i was rather hurt when you stood me up that night 
i don't blame you it was unforgivable
work related or otherwise?
i forgive you
you shouldn't
you couldn't help yourself i mean when you're having a drink with one man you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man you did the only decent thing
don't be too sure just because i wear a uniform  that doesn't make me a girl scout
miss kubelik one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character  and as far as i'm concerned you're tops i mean decencywise  and otherwisewise  cheers
cheers
i shouldn't drink when i'm driving
you're so right
why not?  they seem friendly enough
don't you believe it later on there will be human sacrifices  white collar workers tossed into the computing machines and punched full of those little square holes
dela kiss my big black ass
how many of those drinks did you have?
three
i thought so
nothing  there are just too many people here
why don't we step into any office? there's something i want your advice about anyway  i have my own office now naturally and you may be interested to know i'm the second youngest executive in the company  the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board
no  i like it
really? you mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
of course not
maybe if i wore it a little more to the side   is that better?
much better
and that's how you got me in the first place
well as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me  how about the three of us going out this evening  you and me and the bowler  stroll down fifth avenue  sort of break it in 
this is a bad day for me
i understand christmas  family and all that 
i'd better get back to my elevator i don't want to be fired
oh you don't have to worry about that i have quite a bit of influence in personnel you know mr sheldrake?
why?
he and i are like this  sent me a christmas card see?
i'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me
no problem why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays  i could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling    you sure this is the right way to wear it?
i think so
i didn't think this was in your studies at nyu
you don't think it's tilted a little too much 
after all this is a conservative firm  i don't want people to think i'm an entertainer 
the mirror  it's broken
i know i like it this way  makes me look the way i feel
oh  yes?  just a minute  if you don't mind  this is sort of personal
all right have a nice christmas
oh yes  office party  miss olsen 
that's right  i told you we had a fight  that's what it was about  miss olsen  you know that other girl you saw 
i don't understand 
it's not important fran  the main thing is that i got here in time  and you're going to be all right    isn't she doc?
tonight
give me the gun
i'm so tired  dr dreyfuss here  drink this
miss kubelik    you shouldn't be out of bed
i didn't know  i had no idea this was your apartment 
let me help you
what kind of talk is that?  so you got a little over emotional  but you're fine now
my head  it feels like a big wad of chewing gum what time is it?
two o'clock
where's my dress? i have to go home
you don't want me here 
sure i do it's always nice to have company for christmas
he i'm mona
i just want to go brush my teeth 
oh  of course i think there's a new toothbrush somewhere
no  i don't want anything
i'll fix you some coffee
my sister  she'll want to know what happened to me
wait a minute  let's talk this over first  just what are you going to tell her?
well i haven't figured it out exactly
you better figure it out  exactly suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
i'll tell her i spent the night with a friend
who?
hi mona
someone from the office
and where are you now?
in his apartment
his apartment?
i mean  her apartment
what's your friend's name?
baxter
what's her first name?
miss 
as soon as i can walk
i perfectly understand where you're coming from  as a minority i can relate to your struggle also  but i think you should give us all a chance  we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness
something wrong with your legs?
no  it's my stomach
your stomach?
they had to pump it out
miss kubelik i don't think you ought to call anybody  not till that chewing gum is out of your head 
that's why we have to be careful  we don't want to involve anybody  after all mr sheldrake is a married man 
thanks for reminding me
he doesn't give a damn about me
oh you're wrong he told me 
he's a liar but that's not the worst part of it  the worst part is  i still love him
oh is that what i'm doing?
oh i don't mind as a matter of fact i'm sort of flattered  that anybody should think a girl like you  would do a thing like this  over a guy like me
oh did you find something here  an envelope  ?
yes i've got it  don't you think we'd better destroy it? so it won't fall into the wrong hands  ?
open it
that's right will you see that mr sheldrake gets it?
sure
i'm not very good at it
i am let me get the cards
you don't have to entertain me
give what up?
david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas?  everybody just talk out loud
why do people have to love people anyway?
yeah  i know what you mean  queen
i don't want it
pick a card
a bad insurance risk?
that's me with men i've been jinxed from the word go  first time i was ever kissed was in a cemetery
a cemetery?
i was fifteen  we used to go there to smoke his name was george  he threw me over for a drum majorette
gin
three the last one was manager of a finance company back home in pittsburgh  they found a little shortage in his accounts but he asked me to wait for him  he'll be out in 1965
i've always liked the format of rowan and martin's "laughin"
cut
so i came to new york and moved in with my sister and her husband  he drives a cab they sent me to secretarial school and i applied for a job with consolidated  but i flunked the typing test 
too slow?
oh i can type up a storm but i can't spell so they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator  that's how i met jeff   oh god i'm so fouled up what am i going to do now?
you better win a hand  you're on a blitz
was he really upset when you told him?
mr sheldrake? oh yes very
maybe he does love me  only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife
i'm sure that's the explanation
you really think so?
pressure?  dela you don't know what the hell real pressure is sheeett  this is lightstuff now when you scramblin' out on the street in da january winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with no money and no prospects of money anytime soon now that there is some pressure
no doubt about it
can i have that pad and the pencil?
what for?
i'm going to write a letter to mrs sheldrake
you are?
as one woman to another  i'm sure she'll understand 
miss kubelik i don't think that's such a good idea
well for one thing you can't spell and secondly  if you did something like that  you'd hate yourself
i don't like myself very much anyway
pick up your cards and let's go
i didn't mean it to sound like that
do i have to?
you bet i got a terrific hand
sure
gin
just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne like some?
would you mind opening the window?
i just want some fresh air
it's only one story down  the best you can do is break a leg
so they'll shoot me  like a horse
please miss kubelik you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish
now i'm privileged?  why?  because i didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  because i didn't call home a cardboard box?  no i never ever went to bed hungry and i'm proud of it too  whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you
who'd care?
i would
why can't i ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
yeah well  that's the way it crumbles cookiewise go to sleep
for me?
 mr sheldrake
i don't want to talk to him
i think you should i have to run down to the grocery anyway  all that's left around here is one frozen pizza   i'll be right back  okay?
sure  what's that funny smell?
gas  didn't you turn it on?
you promise?
the point i'm trying to make is that this is a blessing  it's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way
yes i was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress
you turned it on  but you didn't light it
are you supposed to?
in this house you're supposed to
oh
i was washing my stockings so i decided i might as well do your socks
thank you
it's very curious  i could only find three and a half pair
well things are a little disorganized around here
as a matter of fact i'm a pretty good cook  but i'm a lousy housekeeper
naw  i'll take the zero
yes you are  when i was straightening up the couch you know what i found? six hairpins a lipstick a pair of false eyelashes and a swizzle stick from the stork club
it's just that i'm the kind of guy who can't say no  i don't mean to girls  i mean 
you mean to someone like mr sheldrake
i guess so
i know so he's a taker
a what?
some people take some people get took  and they know they're getting took  and there's nothing they can do about it
i wouldn't say that   what would you like to have for diner? there's onion soup and canned asparagus 
i really ought to be getting home my family will be flipping by now
i wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? if they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that 
you feel good not nervous?
you did?
well maybe not exactly  i tried to do it with a gun
over a girl?
worse than that  she was the wife of my best friend  and i was mad for her but i knew it was hopeless  so i decided to end it all i went to a pawnshop and bought a fortyfive automatic and drove up to eden park  do you know cincinnati?
no i don't
anyway i parked the car and loaded the gun  well you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves but believe me it's not that easy  i mean how do you do it?  here or here or here    you know where i finally shot myself?
where?
here
in the knee?
uhhuh while i was sitting there trying to make my mind up a cop stuck his head in the car because i was illegally parked  so i started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off  pow
i feel fine
that's terrible
yeah took me a year before i could bend my knee  but i got over the girl in three weeks she still lives in cincinnati has four kids gained twenty pounds  she sends me a fruit cake every christmas
are you just making that up to make me feel better?
of course not here's the fruit cake  and you want to see my knee? 
so let 'em look i'm going to cook dinner for us we'll have the fruit cake for dessert you just sit there and rest you've done enough for one day
yes nurse
no  just come as you are
say you're pretty good with that racquet
you ought to see my backhand  and wait till i serve the meatballs 
it's a must  graciouslivingwise
not nervous?  relaxed?
might as well go all the way
you usually eat alone?
oh no sometimes i have dinner with ed sullivan sometimes with dinah shore or perry como  the other night i had dinner with mae west  of course she was much younger then  cheers
cheers
the dishes?
i mean after that?
what?
you don't have to if you don't want to 
i don't?
we're going to finish that gin game
sloan will you take your boss out of here so i can get ready
oh
so i want you to keep a clear head
fine how's your eye?
fine
nothing's changed you know we never finished that gin game 
i know  i suppose you heard about mr sheldrake ?
you mean leaving his wife? yeah i'm very happy for you
i never thought he'd do it
i told you all along you see you were wrong about mr sheldrake
i guess so
you sound like the media
for that matter you were wrong about me too what you said about those who take and those who get took? well mr sheldrake wasn't using me  i was using him see?  last month i was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor  now i'm on the twentyseventh floor paneled office three windows  so it all worked out fine  we're both getting what we want
yes  you walking to the subway?
no thank you  i  well to tell you the truth    i have this heavy date for tonight 
aren't you meeting mr sheldrake?
no you know how people talk so i decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled divorcewise
that's very wise
good night mr baxter
good night miss kubelik
i'm fine
are you sure? how's your knee?
this is nothing  it will blow over by tomorrow
i'm fine all over
mind if i come in?
of course not
that's funny  so am i  what did you do with the cards?
in there
i'm going to send him a fruit cake every christmas
seven    queen
shut up and deal
good evening mrs lieberman
some weather we're having  must be from all the meshugass at cape canaveral  you locked out of your apartment?
same thing giuliani said
no no  just waiting for a friend good night mrs lieberman
good night mr baxter
so who did you think it was  kris kringle? what was going on here last night?
last night?
all that marching  tramp tramp tramp  you were having army maneuvers maybe?
i'm sorry mrs lieberman  and i'll never invite those people again
what you get from renting to bachelors all night i didn't sleep ten minutes  and i'm sure you woke up dr dreyfuss
don't worry about dr dreyfuss  i happen to know he was out on a case
i'm warning you mr baxter  this is a respectable house not a honkytonky  come on oscar
what for?
tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal  besides there is no such thing as bad publicity
i thought i smelled gas coming from your apartment
gas?
yes sir
i was sort of wondering what you looked like sit down
yes mr sheldrake
mr dobisch said that?
and mr kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office  without overtime
well you know how it is  things pile up
mr vanderhof in public relations and mr eichelberger in mortgage and loan  they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments
that's very flattering
yeah  i promise
hope the same thing doesn't happen to me  that's some big shoes to fill
i don't know
think
look baxter i'm not stupid i know everything that goes on in this building  in every department  on every floor  every day of the year
you do?
in 1957 we had an employee here name of fowler he was very popular too turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the actuarial department tying up the switchboard figuring the odds on our ibm machines  so the day before the kentucky derby i called in the vice squad and we raided the thirteenth floor
the vice squad?
that's right baxter
what  what's that got to do with me? i'm not running any bookie joint
what kind of joint are you running?
sir?
in time
there's a certain key floating around the office  from kirkeby to vanderhof to eichelberger to dobisch  it's the key to a certain apartment  and you know who that apartment belongs to?
who?
loyal cooperative resourceful c c baxter
oh
are you going to deny it?
no sir i'm not going to deny it but if you'd just let me explain 
you better
well about six months ago  i was going to night school taking this course in advanced accounting  and one of the guys in our department  he lives in jersey  he was going to a banquet at the biltmore  his wife was meeting him in town and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo  so i gave him the key    and word must have gotten around  because the next thing i knew all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets  and when you give the key to one guy you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand  pardon me
just those four  out of a total of 31259  so actually we can be very proud of our personnel  percentagewise
that's not the point four rotten apples in a barrel  no matter how large the barrel  you realize that if this ever leaked out 
no
oh it won't believe me and it's not going to happen again from now on nobody is going to use my apartment 
west 67th street you have no idea what i've been going through  with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key 
how do you work it with the key?
well usually i slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat  but never again  i can promise you that 
well i don't want to intrude  and i thought  since it's all straightened out anyway 
i'm not through with you yet
yes sir
the reason i called is  i won't be home for dinner tonight the branch manager from kansas city is in town  i'm taking him to the theatre music man what else? no don't wait up for me  'bye darling  tell me something  baxter   have you seen music man?
not yet but i hear it's one swell show
how would you like to go tonight?
you getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
you mean  you and me? i thought you were taking the branch manager from kansas city 
i made other plans you can have both tickets
well that's very kind of you  only i'm not feeling well  you see i have this cold  and i thought i'd go straight home
baxter you're not reading me i told you i have plans
so do i  i'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed  so you better give the tickets to somebody else 
i'm not just giving those tickets baxter  i want to swap them
swap them? for what?
oh?  oh
that's good thinking baxter next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here  and as far as i'm concerned you're executive material
i am?
yo dela they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece
now put down the key    and put down the address
relax baxter
thank you sir
yes of course
you know how people talk
oh you don't have to worry 
not that i have anything to hide
oh no sir certainly not anyway it's none of my business  four apples five apples  what's the difference  percentagewise?
here you are baxter have a nice time
you too sir
yeah
oh yes sir very much and i want to thank you 
don't thank me  thank your friends here  they're the ones who recommended you
fine and i want you to know i'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me  sheldrake sure you will  say baxter about the apartment  now that you got a raise don't you think we can afford a second key?
well  i guess so
you know my secretary  miss olsen 
oh yes very attractive is she  the lucky one?
no you don't understand she's a busybody  always poking her nose into things  and with that key passing back and forth  why take chances?
yes sir you can't be too careful
i mean  the young lady  whoever she may be  it was on the couch when i got home last night
oh yes thanks
and now is definitely not the time to bitch up
the mirror is broken  it was broken when i found it
so it was  she threw it at me
sir?
you know how it is  sooner or later they all give you a bad time
i know how it is
you see a girl a couple of times a week  just for laughs  and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife i ask you  is that fair?
no sir that's very unfair  especially to your wife
yeah  you know baxter i envy you bachelor  all the dames you want  no headaches no complications 
yes sir that's the life all right
put me down for thursday again
what you did is dead wrong
roger and i'll get that other key
i hate to disturb you but something came up  it's rather important  and i think it would be a good idea if you could see me  at the apartment  as soon as possible
you're not making sense baxter what's this all about?
i didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party  you know who i mean  i found her here last night  she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills
what?
that's impossible  you'll have to handle this situation yourself  as a matter of fact i'm counting on you 
yes sir  i understand  she left a note  you want me to open it and read it to you?  well it was just a suggestion  no you don't have to worry about that mr sheldrake  i kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble policewise or newspaper wise 
good is there anything you need  money  ?
no thank you mr sheldrake as a matter of fact i've got some money for you  a hundred dollars 
oh  well if there's anything i can do for you 
oh is it?  buddy boy in this business if people don't produce they get fired
for me? i don't think so but i was hoping maybe you could do something for her 
like what? put yourself in my place baxter  how can i help her  my hands are tied 
and i've got good news for you baxter all your troubles are over
sir?
i know how worried you were about miss kubelik  well stop worrying  i'm going to take her off your hands
you're going to take her off my hands?
that's right  i've moved out of my house  i'm going to be staying in town at the athletic club
you left your wife?
well if you must know  i fired my secretary my secretary got to my wife and my wife fired me ain't that a kick in the head?
yeah 
sloan is the hardest working person i've ever met
now what was your news baxter?
it's about miss kubelik  she's all right again  so she went back home
swell and don't think i've forgotten what you did for me  this way baxter
mine?
my assistant roy thompson has been shifted to the denver office and you're taking his place  what's the matter baxter? you don't seem very excited
well it's just that so many things have been happening so fast  i'm very pleased  especially for miss kubelik now that i've gotten to know her better i think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody 
oh sure sure but first the property settlement has to be worked out  then it takes six weeks in reno  meanwhile i'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while  oh by the way you can now have lunch in the executive dining room 
yes sir
i got kicked in the head too
oh?
okay  and you know what i'll swing by my place grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yourshow's that would that be a good thing
let me ask you a question if i may how do you think she got the job in the first place?  i don't mean to burst your bubble mantan the marvelous but sloan is an opportunity
you're working too hard baxter it's new year's eve  relax
yes sir
i suppose you'll be on the town tonight  celebrating?
naturally
me too i'm taking miss kubelik out  i finally talked her into it 
i see
the only thing is i'm staying at the athletic club  and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind 
don't mind what?
you know that other key to your apartment  well when we had that little scare about miss kubelik i thought i'd better get rid of it quick  so i threw it out the window of the commuter train
very clever
i don't believe it
now i'll have to borrow your key
sorry mr sheldrake
what do you mean sorry?
you're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment
i'm not just bringing anybody  i'm bringing miss kubelik
especially not miss kubelik
how's that again?
no key
baxter i picked you for my team because i thought you were a bright young man you realize what you're doing? not to me  but to yourself normally it takes years to work your way up to the twentyseventh floor  but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again you dig?
i dig
do i have to spell it out for you? in fact go ask sloan yourself
so what's it going to be?
thank you sir
no i didn't
but this is the key to the executive washroom
that's right mr sheldrake i won't be needing it  because i'm all washed up around here
just following doctor's orders i've decided to become a mensch you know what that means? a human being
now hold on baxter 
save it the old payola won't work any more goodbye mr sheldrake
yes?
okay get your clothes on i got the cab downstairs
my name is manray goddamnit
now wait a minute i know what you're thinking  but it's not as bad as it looks  matuschka  it's none of my business what you do fran  you're over twenty one  but your sister happens to think you're a lady
all we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes 
look buddyboy  if there wasn't a lady present i'd clobber you
oh this is mr matuschka  he's miss kubelik's  he's got a cab downstairs 
fran been sick or something?
what does he mean accident?
you?
who else?
i know buddyboy i know  but those things don't always run on schedule  like a greyhound bus
i don't mind in the summer  but on a rainy night  and i haven't had any dinner yet 
kook and the gang it's manray let's do the taping  you go back to your dressing room get dressed and blacken up
sure sure  look kid  i put in a good word for you with sheldrake in personnel
mr sheldrake?
that's right  we were discussing our department  manpowerwise  and promotionwise    and i told him what a bright boy you were  they're always on the lookout for young executives bud thank you mr kirkeby
you're on your way up buddyboy and you're practically out of liquor
i know  mr eichelberger  in the mortgage loan department  last night he had a little halloween party here 
well lay in some vodka and some vermouth  and put my name on it
yes mr kirkeby  you still owe me for the last two bottles 
i'll pay you on friday  and whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
oh how are you baxter  they keeping you busy these days?
yes sir  they are indeed 
it looks delicious
oh yes  she's the best operator in the building
i'm a pretty good operator myself  but she just won't give me a tumble  datewise
maybe you're using the wrong approach
a lot of guys around here have tried it  all kinds of approaches  no dice  what is she trying to prove?
could be she's just a nice respectable girl  there are millions of them
listen to him  little lord fauntleroy
instead of friday  could you possibly switch to thursday? you'd be doing me a great favor 
well  it's all right with me bud let me check i'll get back to you
oh i'm very grateful
so long fellas drop in any time the door is always open  to my office
you hear me talkin' to you  the only time you come up here when something is wrong
what do you want?
what do i  ?  just a minute
what's the matter with you buddy boy? i made a reservation for four o'clock remember?
baxter i don't want to pull rank on you  but i told the lady it was all set  you want to make a liar out of me?
are you going to leave mr kirkeby or do i have to throw you out?
now will you get out?
no
well that's very nice of you  but who is this?
dobisch  joe dobisch in administration
oh yes mr dobisch  i didn't recognize your voice 
c'mon mommy don't start with that i'm an ungrateful son stuff
that's okay buddyboy  now like i was saying i'm in this joint on sixtyfirst  and i think i got lucky    she's a skater with the ice show    and i thought maybe i could bring her up for a quiet drink
i'm sorry mr dobisch  you know i like to help you guys out  but it's sort of late  so why don't we make it some other time?
buddyboy  she won't keep that long  not even on ice  listen kid i can't pass this up  she looks like marilyn monroe
i don't care if it is marilyn monroe  i'm already in bed  and i've taken a sleeping pill  so i'm afraid the answer is no
look baxter  we're making out the monthly efficiency rating  and i'm putting you in the top ten now you don't want to louse yourself up do you?
of course not  but  how can i be efficient in the office if i don't get enough sleep at night?
it's only eleven  and i just want the place for fortyfive minutes
i'm all out of liquor  and there's no clean glasses  no cheese crackers  no nothing
let me worry about that  just leave the key under the mat and clear out
yes mr dobisch
i said no such thing  all i said is that something must be wrong
it's not picasso i'm calling about it's the key  to my apartment  you were supposed to leave it under the mat
i did didn't i? i distinctly remember bending over and putting it there 
oh i found a key there all right  only it's the wrong key
it is?  well how about that? no wonder i couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning
and i couldn't get into my apartment  so at four a m i had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut
that's a shame i'll send the key right down and about your promotion    i'm sending that efficiency report right up to mr sheldrake in personnel i wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over
thank you mr dobisch
i have a vague idea
well after all it's my apartment  it's private property  it's not a public playground
you'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you
can't beat it with a hammer  well since you asked it looks like i may have a new show a pilot being shot
you threatening me?
listen baxter we made you and we can break you
look mr vanderhof  i've got you down here for tonight  but i'm going to be using the place myself  so i'll have to cancel
cancel? but it's her birthday  i already ordered the cake 
i hate to disappoint you  i mean many happy returns  but not tonight 
that's not like you baxter just the other day at the staff meeting i was telling mr sheldrake what a reliable man you were
thank you mr vanderhof but i'm sick  i have this terrible cold  and a fever  and i got to go to bed right after work
buddyboy that's the worst thing you can do if you got a cold you should go to a turkish bath  spend the night there  sweat it out 
oh no i'd get pneumonia  and if i got pneumonia i'd be in bed for a month  and if i were in bed for a month 
okay you made your point we'll just have to do it next wednesday  that's the only night of the week i can get away
yeah yeah  good thing
that's wonderful  isn't that what you always wanted a show of your own?
wednesday  wednesday   i got somebody penciled in  let me see what i can do  i'll get back to you
yeah
hi doc  had a late call?
yeah  some clown at schrafft's 57th street ate a club sandwich and forgot to take out the toothpick
oh  'bye doc
say baxter  the way you're belting that stuff you must have a pair of castiron kidneys
oh that's not me  it's just that once in a while i have some people in for a drink
as a matter of fact you must be an iron man all around from what i hear through the walls you got something going for you every night
i'm sorry if it gets noisy 
sometimes  there's a twinight doubleheader  a nebbish like you
if at first it's not what you want just work that much harder peerless
yeah  well  see you doc 
me?
when you make out your will  and the way you're going you should  would you mind leaving your body to the university?
my body?  i'm afraid you guys would be disappointed  good night doc
slow down kid
let me get my bag
how many pills were in that bottle?
it was halffull  about a dozen or so you going to have to take her to the hospital?
get that stuff out of her stomach  if it isn't too late you better put some coffee on  and pray
i don't know  i mean  i wasn't here  you see  we had some words earlier  nothing serious really  what you might call a lovers' quarrel 
mommy please don't call me that
so you went right out and picked yourself up another dame
something like that
you know baxter you're a real cutiepie  yes you are
miss kubelik  fran
fran i'm a doctor i'm here because you took too many sleeping pills do you understand what i'm saying?  fran i'm dr dreyfuss  i'm here to help you you took all those sleeping pills  remember?
mister  miss  such politeness
well  we work in the same building  and we try to keep it quiet 
just as long as she's okay
these cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient i ought to charge you by the mile
sure
son peerless is your name  now you might be one of these hollywood types change your name and all that but peerless dothan is on your birth certificate
kubelik  with two k's
what's her address?  where does she live?
it's regulations
she didn't mean it doc  it was an accident  she had a little too much to drink and  she didn't know what she was doing  there was no suicide note or anything  believe me doc i'm not thinking about myself

i don't know what you're talking about
and before me there was miss rossi in auditing  and after me there was miss koch in disability  and just before you there was miss what'shername on the twenty fifth floor 
will you excuse me?
what for? you haven't done anything  it's him  what a salesman  always the last booth in the chinese restaurant  and the same pitch about divorcing his wife  and in the end you wind up with egg foo yong on your face
where is he?
always happy to do something for our girls in uniform
let me take that
no jeff i can't stay very long  can i have a frozen daiquiri?
it's on the way  i see you went ahead and cut your hair
that's right
you know i liked it better long
yes i know you want a lock to carry in your wallet?
six weeks but who's counting?
i missed you fran
like old times same booth same song 
he's performing at some place outside of richmond virginia
it's been hell
 same sauce  sweet and sour
you don't know what it's like  standing next to you in that elevator day after day  good morning miss kubelik  good night mr sheldrake  i'm still crazy about you fran
let's not start on that again jeff  please i'm just beginning to get over it
i don't believe you
look jeff  we had two wonderful months this summer  and that was it happens all the time  the wife and kids go away to the country and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist  or the elevator girl comes september the picnic is over  goodbye the kids go back to school the boss goes back to the wife and the girl   they don't make these shrimp like they used to
i never said goodbye fran
for a while there you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man then one day he keeps looking at his watch and asks you if there's any lipstick showing then rushes off to catch the sevenfourteen to white plains so you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee  and you sit there by yourself  and you think  and it all begins to look so ugly 
why do you keep calling me jeff? what do you want from me?
i want you back fran
i can't go all the way down south
sorry mr sheldrake  i'm full up you'll have to take the next elevator
you're not giving me a chance fran i asked you to meet me because  i have something to tell you fran go ahead  tell me
not here fran can't we go some place else?
no i have a date at eightthirty
important?
not very  but i'm going to be there anyway
do i that leaky little boat you rented  and me in a black negligee and a life preserver 
remember what we talked about?
we talked about a lot of things
i mean  about my getting a divorce
i don't even know why you're still concerned over him  daddy's not with you
we didn't talk about it  you did
you didn't really believe me did you?
they got it an a long playing record now  music to string her along by my wife doesn't understand me  we haven't gotten along for years  you're the best thing that ever happened to me 
that's enough fran
just trust me baby  we'll work it out somehow 
you're not being funny
i wasn't trying
if you'll just listen to me for a minute 
okay i'm sorry
i saw my lawyer this morning  i wanted his advice   about the best way to handle it 
regardless he still is your father
handle what?
what do you think?
let's get something straight jeff  i never asked you to leave your wife
of course not you had nothing to do with it
are you sure that's what you want?
i'm sure if you'll just tell me that you still love me 
you know i do
fran 
i love you  remember?
i promise
it's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off
yeah  that's me the happy idiot  a million laughs
well that's more like it at least you're speaking to me
funny thing happened to me at the office party today  i ran into your secretary  miss olsen you know  ringadingding? i laughed so much i like to died
is that what's been bothering you  miss olsen? that's ancient history
i was never very good at history let me see  there was miss olsen and then there was miss rossi  no she came before  it was miss koch who came after miss olsen 
now fran 
and just think  right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me 
okay okay fran i deserve that but just ask yourself  why does a man run around with a lot of girls? because he's unhappy at home  because he's lonely that's why  all that was before you fran  i've stopped running
it's christmas eve fran  let's not fight
merry christmas
even more reason to see him  he'll be overjoyed with your success
yeah we better
i have a present for you i didn't quite know what to get you  anyway it's a little awkward for me shopping    so here's a hundred dollars  go out and buy yourself something
don't ever talk like that fran don't make yourself out to be cheap
a hundred dollars? i wouldn't call that cheap and you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment 
stop that fran
you'll miss your train jeff
you run along  i want to fix my face
don't forget to kill the lights see you monday
sure monday and thursday  and monday again  and thursday again 
it won't always be like this  i love you fran
see you later  good luck
c'mon mommy  daddy hasn't been impressed with anything i've ever done  from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present
fran why did you do it? it's so childish  and it never solves anything  i ought to be very angry with you scaring me like that  but let's forget the whole thing  pretend it never happened  what do you say fran?  fran 
of course i'm not here  because the whole thing never happened  i never took those pills  i never loved you  we never even met  isn't that the way you want it?
there you go again  you know i didn't mean it that way fran just get well  do what the nurse tells you  i mean baxter  and i'll see you as soon as i can bye fran 
all set for what?
i rented a car  it's going to be here at one o'clock  we're driving to atlantic city
atlantic city?
i know it's a drag  but you can't find a hotel room in town  not on new year's eve
ring out the old year ring in the new ringadingding
i didn't plan it this way fran  actually it's all baxter's fault
baxter?
peerless last time go see your father
he wouldn't give me the key to the apartment

just walked out on me  quit  threw that big fat job right in my face
the nerve
that little punk  after all i did for him he said i couldn't bring anybody to his apartment  especially not miss kubelik what's he got against you anyway?
i don't know i guess that's the way it crumbles  cookiewise
what are you talking about?
i'd spell it out for you  only i can't spell
first you can't wait to get me up here and now  rush rush rush makes a person feel cheap
sylvia  sweetie  it's not that  but i promised the guy i'd be out of here by eight o'clock positively

i'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can

'bout six months ago i took a man up to lo mung bridge he was regular army too shot himself in the head i brought his body back down
shot himself what for ?
beats me  the sun was too much for him or the mud who knows ?
where ?
ahhh  i never heard of that term before  i thought you were black of africanamerican  no?
first air cavalry they're the ones gonna get us into the river
the draft of that river might be too shallow on the point
i'll go with him 
all right i got a little surprise for you 
you'll see soon enough  get going sailor 
no shit  hot damn 
we found some bodies  let's get out a here
who knows what's up there?
can't be any worse than this what do you think?
i think this river wants to take us home fast i'm practically goin' in reverse
well before there was black or african american there were negroes  i'm a negro
this whole area is lousy with vc  we don't stand a chance lemme turn around and we'll be in hau fat in six minutes
this is my crew and my fucking boat and i'm the responsible party
get in there now or i'll bury you in this river
in the middle of the jungle  a goddamn light
we're americans
i am  i'm captain bl willard this is chief warrant officer phillips  it's his boat we were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food  we can pay you in gold
when'd you do it?
while you were sleeping
thta's not charlie's work 
signs?
i'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes
don't be late
thank you for correcting my ignorance  i'm looking forward to working side by side with you  i feel we make a good team
yeah  like keep out 
what is it?
listen
if they have boats  or canoes they'd get lost in the fog we can't move either  we'll end up on the shore
which way? right or left?
who knows? right
looks pretty shallow
too far inland
one that went up for murder  he was an army sergeant
i never heard about that
my visual style is very erotic sexy how do you say  hot?
yeah  he really dug his playboy mag man  i mean like he was there when it arrived  he just knew
he's in the lbj  didn't give him no medals or nothing 
clear on starboard  where's lance an' the captain?
i saw that colonel's huey on the point 
i wonder if that was the same copter
if you're bl willard 4th recon group we'd like you to come with us
whose orders ?
would he remember you ?
maybe
anyone got a cigarette
this is a tv show not a music video
maybe it's not kurtz i don't believe he's capable of that i just don't believe it
ours
touchy
you can see of course the implications if any of this  even rumours leaked out
you want me to clean it up  simple and quiet
exactly  you'll go up the nung river in a navy pbr  appear at nu mung ba as if by accident reestablish your acquintance with colonel kurtz find out what's happened  and why then terminate his command
terminate ?
terminate with extreme prejudice
yeah it still runs
do me a favor buddy please
then will you teach me what i need to know  maybe we learn from each other if that's possible no?
what is it?
what're you askin' me for  put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow
nobody comes in here
we ain't goin' down the river
charlie?
no it'd be spooky without the war  give 'em back
charlie?
nva regulars they're coming again tonight tet  their big  assault
he was the tragedy  the tragedy of this war
they must have seen the fire
this is a travesty  a debacle
colonel kurtz he's dead
yeah
okay willard sit down
this gentleman or myself ?
no sir
i believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in kontum is that right ?
i am not presently disposed to discuss that sir
i've worked with them on occasions and i saw the movie  sir
he's commanding the detachment at nu mung ba
a lame ?
thank you very much  i always try my best
this is years ago before he joined special forces i guess we had an argument
about what ?
i don't know he was a lame that's all
but why ?
he couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill
well he's killing now
maybe
as i said we can pay you in gold
entirely unnecessary captain
we took them from the dead  now  i assume you want to rest to shower we'll attend to your repairs after dinner
first i would like to say i love the show  it's very courageous my parents marched in selma alabama with dr king
a man of war is never bothered to aid an ally  you will follow me captain
of course captain  an unfortunate necessity
looks like a two thousand pound to me yeah a two thousand pound bomb
no i've seen those in normandy this is much better  my country  my country could never originate this magnificent
of course i  once we make our repairs we could send word we could have you evacuated from here
captain?
you'll get blown outta here some day
we will never 'evacuate' captain  this is our home indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twentyone years there is something to say for that
the vietnamese think it's theirs  i guess the americans do too
but we civilized it a place belongs to those who bring light to it don't you agree
the best defense is offense
i always thought the french came here to get the rubber
do you know that jungle?
when i was a boy my father would take me there to hunt there are a few savages but no man can live there no white man
what about an american named kurtz?
your daughter
we endure captain  you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar  destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp all the while we do but one thing  clean the blood off our bayonets  au revoir captain

nu mung ba last i heard walter kurtz commanded a green beret detachment at nu mung ba
when did you hear?
'bout a year ago? is kurtz still alive?
not a class not a thing just picked stuff up by myself

i met him
don't you agree?
he musta changed   i got to get into the nung river here or here
that village you're pointing at is kinda hairy
hairy ?
i mean it's hairy  they got some pretty heavy ordnance boy  i've lost a few recon ships in there now and again
so? i heard you had a good bunch of killers here
and i don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman nung river you say you don't know kurtz?
i wish i had your natural talent god only makes that visit once in a while
i met him
you talk like him i don't mind taking casualties captain but i like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit  ten cong to one
you'll find enough cong up there
what about this point here?
music?
yeah classical stuff  scares the hell out of the slopes  the boys love it
who?
the enemy who else?
automatic weapons flashes along those trees  probably eleven millimeter guns and ak47's
the trees eh
you sing and dance?
it'll get here soldier
yes i know
the kid can't ride sloppy waves
i'm kurtz
captain bl willard reporting his presence sir
we were attacked  down river we need supplies and medical help
you were not coming here to see me?
no  no sir
you came up my river  in that small boat so simple i always thought the final justice would come from the sky like we did  you are the final justice aren't you?
what do you mean colonel?
a little  i just graduated from nyu film school  cinema studies
what other reason could you have come? a captain ranger paratrooper graduate of the recondo school am i right about these things?
you know you're right
yes
yeah
you're gonna get hit tonight bad  a whole regiment of nva regulars
that's right the little gook pricks but they are noble little gookpricks noble because they fight with their guts like animals and for an idea  that's rich we fight with ingenious machines and fire like gods and for nothing but i'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight we'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight a lightshow how do you like the doors': 'c'mon baby light my fire'
yeah i like it
i love it
no my thinking is clear  but my soul has gone mad
you can't have water after morphine
so what's up with you and dela?
still playing by the rules  you're a damn good kiler
how's the pain?
how's yours?
i can handle it
pain is easy to handle  but nobility the nobility of a man is judged by how much truth he can handle
what truth?
the truth that you were sent here to murder me ans so far you haven't done it and do you know why?  yes you know why  your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it asshole  schmuck  how long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here  except me
no water
you know what you're doing? you are interfering with my plans 
because of all the things we do the thing we do best  is lie
what do you mean?
i think think a lie stinks
oh captain that is so true
stinks i could never figure   i could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm  and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes
fuck no
i'll tell you what makes sense  air strikes  white phosphorus  napalm  we'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want
we'll exterminate the fuckers 
what are you doing?
going back   to the jungle to die
i'm taking you back you can still live
i had immense plans
are you and him kicking it? knocking boots y'knowwhati'mtalkin'bout
i'm gonna get you out of here
i was on threshold of great things
you had immense plans immense plans
yes
i'm taking you back
you get to know each other pretty well out there
and you admired him?
he was a remarkable man it was impossible not to 
love him yes it is true that's the hard part for me i knew him better than anyone  i knew him best
you knew him best
i'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with  you look beautiful like that
you were his friend you must have been if he had given you this  if he sent you to his home he was the best this country had  he was 
yes i know
i'll never get over it  but i'll always remember him
both of us
men looked up to him  he died as he lived
his death was  yes he died as he lived
were you with him when
yes i was he said his last words to me
what?
maybe he'll get inside the tube  where  where they can't see him
not chopped up  not chopped up like that  i mean what do i got left? coupla articles  a medal or two plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore
if that was suppose to be a compliment i thank you
just something i read in the free press
he can't kill us  we're on his side
yeah thanks
want to say goodbye to the colonel?
nah
then let's get the hell out of here
which one's the colonel's?
the yater  the clear one with the thin stringer
yeah jesus christ 
he didn't look like he'd take that sitting down
you're welcome  you shouldn't give up on performing
no  i don't think so but it'll be back they were circling it'll be back
you think he'd of shot us?
when?
any time  us  americans
a yater spoon is hard to get  especially here
he's a man who knows what he wants  he does know what he wants
sure
and you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
it's a feeling you get in the jungle when you get good you can find a track and tell not only how many they are but their morale how far they're going whether they're near their camp the weapons they're carrying
no shit i think i shot the hell out of him
why do you say that?  you've never seen me
you think?
i wasn't looking i was running
no  leave it 
bring your rifles that's all  take us to him
that's me
captain willard  we got these from nha thrang two days ago  they expected you here then 
why?
now i can get out a here  if i can find a way out
we'll be needing some supplies and fuel  do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
i'd just clear out as soon as i could if i were you sir they're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again charlie will start throwing it in hard 
i think that would probably make you the happiest  when i'm hoofing i mean really doing my thing hitting it nothing compares to that feeling in the world
what is this bridge?
it's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into bat shan open  the generals don't like to admit that bat shan is surrounded
where's kurtz? i want to talk to him
oh you don't talk to colonel kurtz  you listen to him god these are good i kept these people off you you know it wasn't easy
why did they attack us?
simple they don't want him to go
you're australian?
preaustralian actually but i'd dig goin' to california i'm california dreamin'
so kurtz is alive
kurtz i tell you that man has enlarged my mind
i envy you  that's the way i want to feel about my work
why didn't he shoot you?
i've asked myself that question i said to myself why didn't he shoot me? he didn't shoot me because i had a stash like you wouldn't believe i hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the orient: marijuana  hashish  opium  cocaine  uncut heroin; the gold of the golden triangle and acid  i make koolaid that makes purple owsley come on like piss now i'm kurtz' own disciple  i listen he talks about everything  everything i forgot there's such a thing as sleep everything of love too
no colonel kurtz couldn't be crazy  if you heard him talk just last week you'd never think he was crazy
is that where he is? by the shrunken heads
those heads yes well the rebels
we're going ashore tie her up  and leave your guns up lance
and shut up
his name is
i'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again
we were going upriver when we got caught in a storm ma'am
tavis thank you for having me
i'm sorry to hear that
cognac?
i should be checking on the boat
the war will still be here tomorrow
no not really
i just follow my footsteps one at a time trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones
what's a big question?
kurtz  i know you've heard of him
yes
what did you hear?
before we begin i want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview  you could have chosen mike wallace barbara walters jane pauley whatnot but you're here
that strange things terrible things have occured around this american kurtz
what things?
gaston would never tell me it was asubject not to be spoken of captain
yes
did you know  deeper in the jungle upriver  there are savages?
i know
but captain i mean  cannibals
the river is beautiful
whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores  a case of grenades a mortar and two m16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order
you may think what you wish captain but i like you very much
i'm more comfortable around my people
then philippe will have to kill all of you
they're in order  it's perfectly clean  just check with comsec intel like i said
well you know i don't have the priority to do that sir it says here not to contact comsec int who's your commanding officer ?
right now  i am
well who the hell verifies that ?
i do
big show in the parade grounds this noon  some boss stuff 
this  bob hope or the like 
no sir i think  this'll be a little bit different 
anyone got a card?
let's jump right into it  your show has sparked a world of controversy provoked a tone of dialogue  how do you see all of this?
stepped on a booby trap sir  got blown all to hell 
well  who's in command here?
i don't know  don't have any idea  i'm just the night man 
son of a bitch sir
beverly hills 
what?
straight up the road  a concrete bunker  beverly hills  where else you think he'd be?
c'mon 
you can pack out of here  two three days' hike along this river at most  weather should hold this early in the season
needs patching
yo tavis check it out  this is the twoone the 21st century and it's all about the money  like my man mase says "it's all about the benjamins"
23   continued:  
now why don't you get around to saying what you want
mind if i get some stuff from my kit?
89   continued:
wait 'til i'm across
107  continued:
inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass
used to see the natives eating roots when i was a kid in nome
134  continued:  
139  continued:
i think you're getting a little moody there eddie
money makes the world go round  it ain't no joke being poor  i know whati'mtalkin''bout y'knowwhati'msayin'?  i've lived on the street  i've been homeless i've learned how to play the game work the game be in the game
150  continued:
175  continued:
so they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  forget it meyerling's right  i'm a dinosaur  greedy bastards like him it's their turn with this land  put me in the woods let me live or die on my own
43   continued:
i'll get you there all right
94   continued:  
it'll be interesting trying to build a fire without any wood
i just want this over with
how?  nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season  besides i'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics
157  continued:
is it inevitable that the game plays you?
there isn't one unless corbett's men get here before the plane does
i'd sure like that favor you offered a while back
168  continued:
your infrared camera?
keep back
i was making my rounds saw your hangar wide open plane getting rained on so i closed it up
26   continued:  
question is why they sat here when the storm moved in  check their stuff while i sniff around
28   continued:
back against the bars  now
no if you go with the flow tavis that's what a lot of negroes don't understand  protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing  if people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it  or better yet write your own show  do it better
six months
can't be  too keen a sense of this place in your pictures
knew you had no native blood even with your dark hair  blue eyes give you away  my wife had blue eyes
had?
she's dead
oh
had some good years  met her in '66  she showed up one day in coldfoot  no one knew her  one sunday morning she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder  didn't work out in three months she'd return the money and leave no hard feelings  my bid was eight thousand dollars  beautiful girl
how did she?
i was gone in september laying traplines  she went to our cache for some meat  got mauled by a bear  tore open her skull more
that's why i left moved to washington  when i met eric i was doing day shoots  products and fashion mostly  pretty dull  eric was teaching college and then he got the job with northland oil  we wanted to stay together so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography and here i am
don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
i don't want to talk any more
wasn't my intention to hurt wilder  i'm telling you the truth  i liked the man  i only meant to get loose to survive your cheechako boyfriend better understand that  listen i've got some money put away 
i have not but i very much want to  what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron?
i was hoping you had some news 
 corbett's a killer
the radio's on the fritz
where'd you say eric is?
somewhere along the pipeline
what about that hotheaded marshal sam wilder?  i heard he was in the middle of this mess
sam?  we haven't seen him
i don't know what a retort is but it's simple  mantan  the new millennium minstrel show is universal  it's not just for negroes in compton or 125th in harlem  this is america  our ancestors helped build this country we got a right just like everybody else  i'm not gonna box myself in this show makes people think and they're laughing at the same time
really  i thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside  by the way  your truck also 'on the fritz?'
why?
it's out by the pumping station shot full of holes
be right back  i left my camcorder in the car
he still might be around  i saw fresh tire tracks coming in
be careful  there're two of them
bastards took off though didn't they?
i bet you haven't had lunch
best thing is meyerling has to chase around to find us
the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do
i admit that's a very hard thing to do  quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors da bomb  125% pure pleasure malt liquor  it makes you wanna get ya freak on and timmi hillnigger 125% authentic gittoe gear when you want to be gittoed fabulous 
eric leave it alone  it's not your business
no way can he get away with this i'll be back by tonight
sure did  he was one of the trappers we rousted from the haul road
was there any trouble?
he was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker
going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers eric
can't help myself  corbett's type always pisses me off  oh i found this at the post office  had your name on it
you were looking at it in the catalog  don't know where you can wear it
i'll wear it for you  and i can wear it when we go home  we won't be here forever
you make it sound like a prison sentence
and this is my very best friend mantan
that's not what i meant
it's exactly what you meant
look why get into this again as long as it's working let's leave it alone  it's been nice so far  we're together 
 permanently?
do i want to be with you permanently?  yes i think i do but be with what you do and the way you live?  that i don't know c'mon eric until i met you coming back to alaska was totally
i thought i should check our emergency transmitters
prolonged darkness makes people crazy
not me  i'm equipped
come here
wait a second
the big apple new york new york
fairbanks is a threehour flight i'll be back by dinnertime
that's my line
you can't stay here  go back to the turtle  i'll meet you back there in a few hours
what's going on?
i'll tell you everything later
where's corbett?
here  a transport plane is due at eleven  once i put him on it it's all over
so what's the problem?
i'm staying
nothing broken  c'mon we have to hurry
to come back to our roots
i've got an idea  we'll have to work fast
my home is here  with you
let's keep going  we're only an hour from devil's cauldron
relax  i just want to ask them how the hunting is
i know  least you didn't shoot all of them
okay by me  you're the one likes these hot springs so much
leave my traps  we'll tag up couple days
can't be much of a crime if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid
i got your plate number asshole maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail
yep  afraid you have me at a disadvantage
our alabamy home  now we're getting countrified  we is bama's
kenai at the general store asked me to bring these  didn't expect we'd already met
no big deal  we just got off on the wrong foot  what's your name?
new to the country kid?
six months  ecological study for northland oil
ecology  folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who
yeah  maybe so
 to take you to jail?  it'll be my pleasure
a daughter in oregon
send him down to her  there's money in my duffel bag back at his cabin
 killing is what you know  pack some food while i prep for the flight  i'm sure not gonna let him go
i'm not moody
no mo' "city slickers"  ahh can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
smart?  sure  that's why i'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses
i needed a pilot's license to take the job here so i got one in six weeks
that makes the flight more interesting
hunting and trapping was a damn fine life  me and mitchell bob and lemalle we were teams  i'd always go with mitchell  good man mitchell  i'd let bob worry about goddamn lemalle  we'd hire a plane in october  on the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere we'd drop supplies  we'd land tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before christmas
you got the belly to look me in the eye and pull the trigger?
i took the odds on getting down in one piece and i made it  now we're in my territory
with light clothing and no supplies this is nobody's territory
you sound like the tourists knowitalls who read about survival in a magazine  fuck you  you won't make it off this mountain
that's right  you're not
look take these cuffs off  we need to work together
tell 'em what you mean mistuh mantan
i don't plan on dying
snow shelter  okay  you dig i'll have a little sitdown
 turn around
we're not sitting here 'til november  there's a cargo plane coming to devil's cauldron in four days and i'm putting you on it
we get wet we freeze to death in a couple hours
i've been on ice like this when i was a kid skating  spread your weight keep moving  go on
i'm right behind you
it wasn't my idea to crash the plane
let's camp  there's grayling under this ice i'll snare some for dinner
we've got another two hours of daylight
well thank you mistuh sleep 'n eat
pushing it is flat wrong  all you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail
forget it  it would take days
going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on
it could blow over tomorrow too
i'm still figuring: you're either real brave or real dumb
you know meyerling?
sure  the people's friend  kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it
i'm here to do my job
you want to fool yourself about that bullshit job fine  damn shame you have to drag your girlfriend along  you think a woman like that will be happy making moose stew for a man more
yeah?
give or cousins some of dem educated feets
yep  sometimes they do but usually they end up crazy or dead
too bad we're heading west
there's a snowmobile inside a day we could be on the yukon  i got money there  remember that five thousand?  make it ten  be smart  take it and walk away
you don't get it do you?
you're not going to slow us down keep moving
if that means freeze my balls off no thanks  i'll be okay
how many do you see?
what?  fuck off  save yourself
you don't feel cold?
it's a spring day
you tellin' the truth
where's my elt?
emergency transmitter?  all your gear is back at wilder's
you got one?
it was blown up with the plane
too bad  we'd be out of here in a few hours
an appetite  maybe you won't die after all
hate to disappoint you
told that's what our old man was planned on going to sea me and bob 'til i read jack london started trapping when i was ten mailed the furs to sears  eight bucks for a skunk three for a muskrat  that was fine money
killing wildlife not good enough anymore so you go on to bigger and better things
you got a knack for seeing things the way you want to see them
go to your windows and yell out scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted bruised and battered bodies  i'm sick and tired of niggers and i'm not gonna take it anymore
yeah it is fucked up  but it's not too late to keep that from happening here
all you do is keep folks from working the land living like they're meant to  you don't understand shit  trappers hunters  we're part of the environment  who's protecting us?  i've seen plenty like you  so more
i'm real sad you don't approve of me
cowardly bastard  i'm in handcuffs and i still scare the piss out of you
don't bet on it
i already have
you don't know how true that is
hell i still get a knot in my gut every season wondering how much longer i can go on  no 'home for retired trappers' that more
you broke the radio remember?
i'm sure she's fine  seemed like a clever kid
the one with da big
i liked you better frozen  you didn't talk so much
you're damn lucky glimpsing this country before it's ruined gone for good  you saw wonders you'd only dreamed of  that alone makes you different than the sorry bastards back where you came from because you have dreamt them
lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area  only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths elt was in my duffel bag not around my neck where it should've been
no way they'll find you on a fiveminute signal  and no way more
shut up

you kill me you sign your death warrant  and hers
why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
the time has passed for men like them and me  i know it  but they're still fighting for survival like cornered animals that's why they'll kill you more
wound's a throughandthrough missed my liver i think
not her the one with the little
let's get out of here
like i said i'd still be up on that mountain frozen solid it wasn't for you
we'll get you to a hospital soon as we get to fairbanks
you're wrong  everything we do leaves its mark  you said it yourself  there are hundred yearold footprints in the tundra
benboys  yeah real slow and i'd like to keep it that way
just passing through
i'm living proof of that sad fact
can we buy the marshal some dinner?
no i better stay at my post
but i would
oh her
you left a footprint at the sportsmen's camp  only pretty sight there ben 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure
i got it from here  thanks
sam give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit will you?
if that was all fine  but carving him up stranding the others that's too fucking much is everything that walks crawls flies or swims fair game to you?
i'll get loose before that plane comes
don't try me  i'll kill you if it comes to it
good idea  flying over mountains can give you some nasty surprises  go too low one of the clouds might have a big rock inside it
i don't want to hurt you sam
i'm not too old to knock the snot out of you
nothing personal
tomorrow is her birthday and i want to get her something really nice like a
what's the problem with sam wilder's place?
will you rent me a cabin or not?
pretty clever:  if the trappers got that signal beacon and get here in time sam's is the first place they'll look  they may figure you're waiting for an airplane so you can't stay in the shack by the airstrip  last place they'd expect you is on the far side of town  i can't afford any trouble 
 here's a hundred dollars  and if you or anyone else will back me up on this 
 forget it  and try not to bleed on my throw rugs  why do this?
if you have to ask you wouldn't understand
sure
snowplow generator tv dish hell we get the goddamn playboy channel  here this is for you
have you heard anything from the girl staying with me anne marie?
not a damn thing  what's going on?  mr meyerling was here all steamed up looking for you
my kids?  let's seesusan's 15 aundrea's 9  don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid  how old are you?  never mind let me just tell you this: every stupid cliche you hear about kids  they change your life they make you a better person they make you whole  it's all true  before i had kids when friends talked about their kids i wanted to vomit  now  i get it  am i right leon?
she hates dem
look neff i've got ben corbett with me 
 here?  where's wilder?
back at my place he uh broke his leg
 i'm putting him on the plane to fairbanks eleven tomorrow
jiminy christmas  what do you want from me?
corbett ruined my twoway  go to my place on the haul road tell anne marie i'm okay and to sit tight
just stay out of my face until i'm gone
yeah  sorry i barked at you last night
i'm the one should be sorry goddamn kenai always out for a score  i never should've let him go over there
what are you talking about?
too bad  how 'bout a dress?
bastards killed sam you think they won't kill the rest of us?
there'll be three four men at the most  i have some backup nothing will happen
i'm real sorry  in a while you're gone from this country but we live here  no one wants to mix it up with those hombres
 sam wilder was my cousin he's why i came to alaska  all his letters saying what a paradise it is  but me ending up dead won't do sam a lick of good
you're an outsider mr desmond step aside; stay out of it
what does this matter to you?
you can't see past your lousy little assignment sniffing around the pipeline  the few voters there are in this district look up to corbett and i'm not about to alienate them
i should release corbett because you want some votes?
this miserable wilderness is a state of the union  policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box  that's the beauty of it  these icebox cowboys are living a century too late  get them on your side it's like buying manhattan for beads  with a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the new world
some day these people'll wake up and you'll be the first one they'll run out of here
sleep 'n eat one of dem slinky sexy little foxy
fuck you
this isn't your concern  it's over here and now
 we appreciate the company anne marie's getting cabin fever already
mobile arctic dwelling  mad
damn  likely that's an sos have to pass on that lunch
we'll go with you
any idea who could've done it?
that's what we should've done in the first place
i could've sat tight for the transport 'til bob came poking around
i just as soon he stay gone fool could've got us all killed arresting ben corbett here in town
mantan way too short too tight get her one of dose
bet i could make some money turning ben corbett in  maybe more for lettin' him loose  i was up in my cache  saw the northland man come talk to you
you're out of your greedy goddamn mind
corbett coming here stinks of trouble  we should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass
stay out of it
dixie's waiting at the infirmary she'll put a splint on that injured leg
aw jesus  told you this was trouble  what about you big shot?  do something  who's side are you on anyway?
goddamn  viking bob  mitchell's inside boring bastard
it's a long shot
get the fuck out of here
it's a threehour flight  they shoulda got there yesterday
to big  the inbetween one not too tight not too lose
maybe they went back to devil's cauldron
cool out  i ain't about to get blasted
what you gonna do with it?  large bore's for shit on small game
not in the right hands it ain't
quit fucking around  get in
i'm right fuckin' here with you
ease off  we do this my way
doesn't matter  we know where they're going  c'mon
musta never got a chance to more
closest planes for hire are here in cache
that'll work  i just bought one for myself
hang on  remember that cessna we saw at the pumping station on the haul road?  belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline
that plane might've been to throw us off the track  remember the baitandswitch wilder pulled with the eskimo and his truck?
we were just talking about him
musta wanted to keep him from the bears  if ben killed him he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this
where's the kid?
they'll have to come right past us
on a good day i couldn't spare a crosswalk guard  but now no way  folks're batshit with the weather turning sour  bring him in yourself
next plane's not coming 'til next monday
sit your suspect out in the cold he'll keep
this man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration
i thought you got rid of
so shoot him  won't have to feed him that way 
huh?
you met the gift
do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
it lets a crazy man into our lives

it's not your table it's the place's table behave this once you can sit at someone else's station
you're gonna die soon with that diet you know that?
we're all gonna die soon i will you will it sure sounds like your son will
okay
i see the help  judgement call
just give yourself a little pep talk "must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out"
what's wrong with your son anyway?
what do you care?
no
an ear infection can send us to the emergency room  maybe five six times a month where i get whatever nineyearold they just made a doctor nice chatting with you

otherwise you're not ugly
okay pal  i accept the compliment but go easy  my knees start aknocking when you turn on the charm full blast
what's with the dark?
you all set here?
what are you doing here?
are you totally gone? this is my private home
i am trying to keep emotions out of this even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject
what subject? that i wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
no she didn't
yes i do as a matter of fact and to prove it i have not gotten personal and you have why aren't you at work? you're not sick  you don't look sick just very tired and bitter
my son is sick okay?
how do you know about my mother?
i hear you talk when i'm waiting
how ya doing?
no stay away from me
carol the waitress?
yes
i was working  can't you just drop me a thankyou note?
that's not why i'm here    though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer
yes she did
note put it in the note
why did yo do this for me?
to get you back at work so you can wait on me
but you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? i'm worried that you did this because
i don't think i can wait until tomorrow this needs clearing up
what needs clearing up?
i'm not going to sleep with you i will never ever sleep with you never not ever
okay anything else??
just how grateful i am
yes
i heard different thought that was
a thankyou note for what you did for me
he wants me to take his car and his client to baltimore
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city
yes i'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore
okay
hey what i did for you is working out?
what you did changed my life
well part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother my son and me than anyone else ever has and that makes you the most important surprising generous person i've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever
lovely
i also wrote one part i wrote i'm sorry i was talking about i was sorry when i got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so i wrote that  i was sorry for busting you on that and i'm sorry for busting in on you that night when i said i was never i was sorry and i'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler
not that time
thank you
now i want you to do something for me
i want you to go on this trip
no sir
i can't do this alone i'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me i need you to chaperon separate everything but cars you said you liked convertibles now i'm on the hook
the stiff one eye?
two days
i can't i work
you take off when you have to
my son
so when are you comin' to pick us up?
bettes tells me he's doing fine
melvin i'd rather not
what's that got to do with it?
funny i thought it was a strong point
write me a note and ain't she sweet i need a hand and where'd she go
are you saying accepting your help obligates me?
is there another way to see it?
no
are you still coming?
yes
around
just south to baltimore maryland so i know what you're going to ask next  that you might ask  i'm not certain
there's there's no need to bring anything dressy or i mean  i didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes
oh  we might yes we can let's
okay gotcha what did you think i was going to ask?
whether crabs are in season there now
oh okay then  melvin good night
thanks for being on time carol the waitress this is simon the fag
hello oh my god who did that to you?
it's okay no problem where should we sit?
i  uh i well there is no place cards or anything
that's unique
too early
let me go in back you look like you need all the room you can manage
welcome
nonsense
anybody here who's interested in what melvin has to say raise their hands
you like sad stories  you want mine
go ahead simon your father walked in on you and was yelling and really come on
no
yes sure  i'll take the sofa
dancing?
just him and that's it okay you can answer  we've worked it out
then what about
you promised a nice place  can't you just  you have these dry cleaned all the time don't you?
i've been thinking about that since you brought it up before
and?
no   i don't get this place they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress i don't get it
melvin pay me a compliment i need one and quick you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings
that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away never fails
that's not compliment melvin that's just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid a compliment is something nice about somebody else now or never
okay
can we order first?
fries
too late maybe around
one baked  one fries
don't be pessimistic it's not your style okay here i goes clearly a mistake  i have this  what? ailment and my doctor  a shrink who i used to see all the time he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help i hate pills very dangerous things pills "hate" i am using the word "hate" about pills my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never  well you were there you know the next morning i started taking these pills
i don't quite get how that's a compliment for me
then i've really overshot here 'cause i was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out
takes months to know they work little by little  talking like this is exhausting
never
here's the trouble with never
that wasn't payment when you first came into breakfast when i saw you  i thought you were handsome then of course you spoke so now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed tell me why did you bring me?
tell me even if you're scared tell me why you wanted me here it's okay
there are lots of reason i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might
perfect
sex with simon?
it's one idea
that's why you brought me? look at me is that really why you brought me like i'm a what and i owe you what?
i don't know why i brought you  that idea occurred to me is all it came out first hey you kiss him  me he says he loves you you two hit it off but you don't want to fine forget what i said about sex with simon it was a mistake
i'll never forget you said it
it was a mistake
to hell with sex
let me see ahh gorgeous
do it then get the dog picked up i can't believe you let it stay there
what do you mean? you said you liked it
that's what i like about you and me we git along
i don't
this one has a special meaning
it's your car but i don't want to hear it if that means anything
i'll take a bus
i'll take you why not?
i don't care what you did for me i don't think i want to know you anymore  all you do is make me feel badly about myself  you have my number
yeah well
how you doing?
i can trust my brain
that seems like a good choice
like macaroni and cheese
i don't know whether i'm being sensible or hard on you
the two might go together
see there's an example i don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now
cute
you don't have to answer everything i say just listen to me okay?
go ahead
i should've danced with you
okay goodbye
so long
were you asleep?
like grits and butter
what do you want?
'cause if you were asleep  i'm sorry and you could be grouchy
grouchy?
 'cause of being woken up and it would make my job impossible so then i wouldn't even try
what job?
were you asleep?
what are you doing here?
what a break
is it a secret what you're doing here?
i had to see you
like fried and chicken
because
it relaxes me i'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine
oh come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you
maybe we could live without the wise cracks
see it's four in the morning a walk sounds a little screwy to me if you don't mind
if you need an excuse there's a bakery on the corner there's a shot it'll open soon  that way we're not screwy  we're just two people who like warm rolls
okay
melvin even though it may seem that way now  you don't know me all that well  i'm not the answer for you
you know what? i
just let me talk  i'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth i'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do  in every single thought you have in how you are with spencer  spence   in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good
you slept too near where you got in?
i'm gonna grab you  i didn't mean it to be a question i'm gonna grab you
i'm sorry i can't hear you i can't turn my head all the way yet tell her we can't hear her
yes i really would
well
no let me pull over so i can pay full attention
no nervous it would be very rough carol if you weren't along
what a nice compliment
our room i don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door
i don't think so you need help with the pants?
no
i slept too near where i fell out
i'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal
uhhuh
i'm sorry are you okay?
well considering everything's horrible and tomorrow i have to face my parents don't ask me  i'm sick of my own complaints  got to get me a new set of thoughts
why? what have you been thinking about?
how to die mostly
can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate
good night
no absolutely not i'm shyer than you think i give the wrong impression sometimes and
i haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks
yeah  and he still went to the party
you expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity
stop staring do a vase
but you're beautiful your skin glows
thanks but i just want to take a bath and
that long neck  the line of you you're porcelain your back goes on forever you're classic you're why cavemen chiseled on walls

i just love her  how're you doing?
i'll take care of myself 
you think you're kidding
don't want to i love you
no no get carol
mantan it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
i'm filling in we don't know if she's coming back she might have to get a job closer to home
what are you trying to do to me?
what the heck do you mean?
hey elephant girl call her or something  just let her do my one meal here i'll pay whatever i'll wait  do it
if you want to see me you will not do this you will make an appointment
explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like i have any choice in barging in
there's not going to be a debate you must leave
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app 
you changed the room around
two years ago
hold on you allegorical hypothesis don't cross words with me
shhhhhhh i don't have this mountain of available time  i got to get to my restaurant on time do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
yes  no
won't worry about it you go ahead
jackie will you hand me the mirror?
your neighbor  udall  is taking care of him
how could you do that? he'll hurt him
no i promise  not a chance i own this guy there was no one else i'm on the move too much trust me
you are very certain my dog is okay  because you have no idea
yes your dog is fine simon
so am i frank
ain't jemima on the pancake box?
what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me i don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show are we being neighbors for now?
hope you find him i love that dog
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude but i grew up in hell my grandmother had more attitude you don't intimidate me
police police fucking crooked police  doughnutmunching morons help me  assault and battery and you're black
shhhh now i like simon i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again meanwhile i'll try and think how you can make this up to him  i hate doing this i'm an art dealer  have a nice day party
i'm not saying nothing to you
thanks for looking after him
you don't want to mess with me today i'll figure something else out tomorrow
he's a pain in the ass
it's been five weeks  another few won't kill me
dat's yo uncle ben  that reminds me i've seen a lot of troubles lately
no he wants him back he'll be by tomorrow
okay by me
sure  take him to the vet
i did and his stomach is out of whack so they need him for a couple of days
do it
really nice shouldn't that be a good thing telling someone 'no thanks required'
it looks like it really went over you're sure making the rounds simon says you brought him soup last night i hope he doesn't write you a note
"what?" look at you you sense a mark
hey  you called me i
about a dog
how be dat?
yeah but it's all about simon now you helped with the dog and now there are other things i'm just as concerned as you are about simon
concerned i'm just the hall monitor here
it's not only financial assistance what he's got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money it's not going to happen on the phone
yeah if his parents are alive they've got to help  those are the rules good
yes and tomorrow? i have a high maintenance selling painter coming through so i'm out can you take him?
think white and get serious
like the wind but i'm not doing it
if there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know
last word freak
hi you have hard shells right?
i don't know who i am
what?
they require a tie and jacket but we have some available
wait here
no it's all right i'll just watch
i haven't looked at myself yet i figured i could tell from your reaction
you little stinker he's given you everything
frank's idea he thought i should have notes so i did this right maintained focus didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you
terrify me?
see he's right i need the cards  simon you're broke
well i can't reach them
well i'll be an alabama porch monkey's uncle
i'll be able to keep my apartment and studio won't i?  just tell me
no would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
absolutely
not just today  uh could you do it  until until he gets back on his feet?
sure thing
you're a wonderful man two o'clock is a good time here's the key in case he's asleep open the curtains for him so he sees god's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best
where'd they teach you to talk like this  some panama city "sailor want to humphump bar"? or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey sell crazy some place else  we're all stocked up here
how come you're pretending to do cop work  'cause i don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole
what?
just move on no one here killed him
years ago i married a widow who had a grownup daughter  my daddy visited us often fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her thusly he became my soninlaw and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son which of course was my father's brother inlaw and my uncle for he was the brother of my stepmother  my father's wife also became the mother of a son  he was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter  accordingly my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother 
oh is he dead?
ask him
we will if we can and if we can't we'll come back and ask you again and again
what's he look like?
i got it you're talking about your dog i thought that was the name of the colored man i've been seeing in the hall
like thick molasses with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food
how're you doing?
franks shows my work mr udall i think you know that
'love was '
maybe this can wait
mantan dat sho' is a whopper
well that's a load off
do you realize that i work at him?
no i didn't
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
no  actually i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d
well i work all the time so never never again interrupt me okay? i mean never not 30 years from now not if there's fire not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudgepacker you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states and he's going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone  don't knock   not on this door not for anything got me sweetheart?
yes it's not a subtle point you're making
okay then
could you take it just a little easy mr udall?
i called i never touched you i didn't leave my name or nothing
you're worried for my safety  i'm touched
a song a comin' i feel
verdell?

that cleaning woman doesn't
please just leave
where are all your queer party friends?

nellie you're a disgrace to depression
rot in hell melvin
well homeboy looks like he's at a funeral
no need to stop being a lady quit worrying  you'll be back on your knees in no time

oh my gosh
now we'll both call him
come on sweetheart
yo yo yo
stupid dog  i don't get it
thanks
i have never been so tired in my life okay if i sit here?
enough
got any easier questions?
but sick  nauseous  where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches  when you can barely get up the will to complain
yeah
let's do the small talk in the car load up
never a break never
this stuff is pointless
not at all huh? let's go to the hotel and if you're lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money
melvin
wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not
you consider your life easy
what do you want to know?
i give you that one  nice packing
 so mom truly no grudges  truly a little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard i was hurt but the important thing i want you to know is your son is happy i'm working again i'll make do  i don't want a thing wouldn't take it if it was offered i'll drop you a note from wherever i land and then it's up to you i hope we patch things up but know that if we don't i wish you both the very best i can't hear you you heard me though right? good  take good care 'bye
i'm going back with you
i know i'm a little bit nervous suddenly everything seems so easy carol a load has been lifted
another place where?
does it matter?
look i've got to get a hold of frank and see where i'm hanging my hat 'cause
what are you talking about?
they did a nice job cozy huh?
i love you
the good stuff
look we both want the dog  and
i'm coming
i'm a great guy  "extraordinary"   and she doesn't want contact with me  i'm dying here
because   you love her?
no and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp
okay you tell me why   "you're dying here"
i don't know let me sleep on it and figure it out  because i'm stuck can't go back to what i had she's evicted me from my life
did you like it that much?
it was better than this look you i'm very intelligent if you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope you got to be better than you're doing if you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up i'm drowning and you're describing water
picking on me won't help
i'm an asthmatic  been one all my life  can't go anywhere without an inhaler
well if that's true then i'm really in trouble
but you know where you're lucky?
absolutely not
you know who you want i'll take your seat any day so do something don't sleep on it go over there i don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything  it's not always good to let things calm down
hey i'm charged here but she might kill me for showing up this late
then get in your jammies and i'll read you a story i think you've got a chance the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically  the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever  so go catch her off guard
okay thanks a lot here i go
i forgot to lock the door
what's it mean?
that somebody out there knows what it's like to be  in here
what else?
oh god this is like a nightmare
aw come on just a couple of questions  how hard is that?
i think of a man and take away reason and accountability
how about that pose?  this is not fun  give me some direction
the fact that you haven't said "hold it" means i haven't done it right  is that correct? i haven't done it right?
no  okay what i do is watch and wait for um you ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching  an old woman on a bus kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external  that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? they are just sort of realer and more alive and when you notice it so are you if you look at someone long enough you discover their humanity
yes  well there's one more stage  trying to figure out if it's any good
just a second  he has to go
please no
no no no hey that painting in there  i just want to tell you
are you trying to rap to me?
no  no problem  the airport right?

after those cops you'll never be able to come back to cleveland
i hope you save a little somethin' somethin'
who the fuck cares about cleveland cleveland blows  what kind of marks have they got here?  greasy mobster teamster or some hand job politician  i want the money marks i want the marks that you get
we go around once
bullshit
what?  what's okay?
there's a sand barricade up ahead; i'm going to ram this cab into it the cab has an airbag odds are good i'll survive  but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass odds for you are not so good
i know you're going to jump
i knew the same way in ten years you're going to know
what does that fucking mean?
it means that i'm going to tell you things even though i already know that you're not going to listen to a god damned thing i say
i ain't scared of you
gots no intention of ending up broke
yeah you are and you hate it  you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't  that you're sweating your balls off and i'm not you've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid all because of me

y'know at the beginnin' of the century africanamerican had to perform in blackface  you ever heard of bert williams?  he was a great artist
you don't know a fucking thing about me  you don't have the slightest fucking clue
why don't you tell me
i'll tell you this  after cleveland i thought i was lucky to be alive  but now here i just realized that you were the lucky one
now i'll tell you something  it wouldn't fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars you'd still be thinking the same thing that you're going to take me and here i am sitting through this knowing it's bullshit looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind the only thing i can think is that in just a few minutes i'm going to take you
bain
you're too late
no  no  no  i don't believe it
they money will be standard bank transfer  we believe we will know where and when
what?
i don't give a fuck what you are  i asked you 
no before my time
do you want rath or not?
sure
yes sir
yes  this is the hotel paraiso
no the other hotel paraiso in the city  near the plaza del sol
i'm sorry sir  a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso this is the new hotel paraiso
take us there
sick  the flu
i don't believe you
i'm worried about you robert
you don't read do you?
the contract was stolen
a new player  he's using the name nicholai
know what?
the fucking contract  how in the fuck did he know
i know  it was a joke
tomorrow  the buyer is japanese his retirement a condition of the bonus
freelancer  a woman  surveillance specialist
the contract?
paid in full
fuck you fuck cleveland and fuck your contracts 
never read a book in my whole life
i bet you fucking know
it cost us
he stole another contract
robert?  robert?
$1000000
we have an mo her system is protected by her 'pussy virus'
he has to clean up  how many bodies were there?
um five
one hour per man
where are we going?
maybe you need to start
what?  how did you know i had a cat?
took a guess  lucky for you i guessed right
who the fuck are you?  who do you work for?
i work for the government
yeah?
yeah
you're one of them aren't you?  a fucking pro
i'm part of the game just like you
what do you mean 'that's all'? what in the hell do you know?
the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars
maybe i need to do a lot of things
ten million 
now you understand why i'm here
turn off the engine
no stay in the car  i want you to understand something  if i intended to kill you you would already be dead
you're the computer hacker you tell me
you didn't know anything about me
yellow pages  v for veterinarian there aren't that many
'them'?
an assassin?
until a minute ago
bert williams and the rest they had to black up  they had no choice  they were considered 3/5ths of a human being  did you know that's written in the constitution of the united states?
what does that mean?
if i still was what i used to be you would not be pointing that at me
another contractor
someone hired both of you?
no  they hired bain  the contract would have been mine but bain took it from me as he took the previous one
so this is something between you and him?
he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him
why?
because he is trying to retire me
he wants to kill you?
okay  you ready?
i just don't want you and cheeba to get hurt
yes
why?
the nature of the business  you remove your competition
and you want to use me to get him?
yes
forget it
we don't have a choice
right
i'm two seconds away from making my choice which means you've got two seconds to tell me why i shouldn't shoot you
it's simple  you need me  i need you  and we will both need money
we can look out for ourselves
i don't need you to get the money  my money
if it hadn't been for me you would be dead
this is something that is never going to end  you can never work in the business again with this contract because he will find you to survive you have to go into deep hiding  and that's going to take money a lot of money
then you can have the disks and i'll just walk out that door 
if you walk out that door bain will still come after you
why?
because he took a contract on you he'll come for you and he'll find you
you don't know that  you're trying to scare me
no  it's the truth  i know what you are  like me like bain you're a ghost you're not part of the real world  you don't have a social security number  you don't pay taxes  you've probably used ten different names over the last ten years  a long time ago something probably happened something illegal and you ran you disappeared and it was easy  you think you can do it again  but i'm telling you fading from the law is nothing  no matter what you do where you go i swear to you that bain will find you
how?
for what?  he left  not me
right now as we sit here he is tearing through your apartment  he is digging through your drawers emptying your closets  he will take your telephone and address books your appointment books  if you keep a diary he is reading it  he'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat liquor you drink cigarettes you smoke  in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled  if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them
he will know everything about you everything  i know because i've done it  once you've been inside a mark's home you're in their head if you're any good you'll find the mark in a week and bain is good because i was the best and i couldn't take him
rath  robert rath
electra
just electra?
yeah
as in daughter of agamemnon?
no  just electra
what do you want to know?
if bain hadn't taken the contract on me would you have?
my people love me
why?
because i'm done
this is crazy  i can't trust you you can't trust me  how can we possibly help each other?
it's not the same is it?
better than playing with yourself
he was russian  nicholai tachlinkov  a legend in the business when i was just starting i admired him  when i heard he loved chess i became obsessed with the game
we played with a code using <u>the new</u> <u>york times</u> obituaries  over three years we played twelve matches  i never won
why didn't you finish this game?
he was killed
why?
y'know what?
because that's how it works  that's what it's about  he was the best he was on top
where you wanted to be?
yes  as soon as you get into this business all you can think about is getting to the top  that's all there is  until then there is nothing  you are nothing
how did you get into the business?
the same way everyone does; the government the agency
the cia?
more or less
how old were you?
they recruited me when i was in high school
jesus  why?
what?
languages  i was already fluent in nine languages
you were like a boy genius?
some people said that  i never thought so
why not?
i was just different
you went from high school to the agency?
no  i graduated from george washington university  then i entered the agency training program
they didn't give you a choice did they?
no they didn't
but you knew what they were training you for?
you look beautiful like that
of course  i was going to be james bond
ahhhh
they are very good at what they do it's very seductive  the training the weapons the travel 
the exotic women
women?  no not really
why not?
women i don't i don't want to talk about women
why?
because you are a women
why did you leave the agency?
worked my black ass off first as an intern then worked my way up to this position
the same reason everyone does  you hear your name on cspan and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you
they tried to kill you?
yes  it didn't matter much to them as long as i disappeared
then you went freelance?
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government so you make more money  then once you make the transition you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets
tell me about the first time
my first take?
yes
why?
because i want to know
you leave something out?
it was mechanical  very precise it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline
are they usually like that?
no  just the first one
after that?
they become complicated messy
did it ever bother you?
did it ever bother james bond?
that's fiction
this is fiction  don't you see that?  this is another reality  and the people that come into the world to play this game  nobody forces them  they're here they know the rules the stakes the risks  do you understand what i am saying?  no one is innocent  including you
does that mean it didn't bother you?
after my internship expired dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant
no  something honest
you said you didn't trust it
i don't
several
good
where is it?
mexico
thinking
about?
nothing
yeah yeah  jesus
and?
i don't know
you were there?
what?
i wasn't expecting this  i need to think
why not?
it helps me to focus  it centers me helps me think
oh  what do you think about?
work  the things i need to get done
yes
but you've never figured out a way to win
and what?
no
not even a stalemate?
no
what happens if you do?
i don't know maybe i'll live on a boat sail to all the places i've never been
that sounds nice
you can have the bed  the chair is fine for me
here?
in costa blanca
yes
stop playing me sloan
i don't know but i'm sure he's not sleeping
why don't you bring it out here? it's beautiful out here
okay
really?
he won't be looking for you  just be careful  buy a book  keep your sunglasses on
book  sunglasses  great
sorry
how was the beach?
the beach?  it was nice
taiwan
just ask me what you want to know
not that i would know but you look like you're really good at it
thank you
i've always wanted to learn something like that
you should  it's very important that the body release the energy that builds in it
transmits and receives
cheap as shit
they saw you coming a mile away  if i had known we'd be using 
it's too late now  okay?  we'll have to deal with these
fine
check
oh you gonna make me say it
he will be hidden somewhere out here probably somewhere low in the crowd  he'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank
but he won't shoot you right then?
no  it would be amateur  a risk he'll wait for the prime shot that he knows is coming  once i'm inside he'll move to the hotel he'll go up the back too much traffic in the front
okay  then what?
then we wait
aiiee  more waiting?  i don't know if i like this plan
it will take the entire day but he will begin to doubt himself  he will begin to believe that he missed me that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe
why won't he wait until the bank closes?
he won't be able to  he'll have to go inside  he'll have to see with his own eyes whether or not i am there  if the bank closes he won't know for sure  he'll come  i'm sure  and when he does you'll go into the hotel go upstairs and take the gun
what?  what if he brings it with him?
say what manray?
that means you won't have a gun
that's right
and with the mikes i'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank
if things go well i don't have to you'll already be in a rented car waiting for me
you'll have the money  how do i know that you won't 
i'll be walking out of the bank unarmed  you'll have the gun and i'll drive the car
we split the money?
five million apiece  you get on your plane i get on mine
sounds pretty well figured out
i've been thinking about it for a long time
did you ever sleep with dela?
except 
what?
except if he doesn't come out of the hotel
i told you he will
you can't know for sure how can you?  i mean you're not him
i was
for nicholai?
yes
you killed him here?  in this city outside that bank?
i don't know  it just happened  i was here ten years ago i'm here now  that's it
we did it one time only once  it had nothing to do with the job it was stupid  everything i've got i've earned
i don't believe that
it wasn't planned or premeditated i swear  things happened beyond my control  i understood; i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense
ten years ago
yes
what happened?
i waited until i was insane and then i walked into the bank  he was sitting there very calm waiting for me
what did he want?
he wanted what i want now; to get out of the business  to disappear to some empty greek island
what did he say?
he said i couldn't win  that no one wins at this game
aw c'mon
was that it?
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away to quit the business
you didn't take it
no  i went back to the hotel  and waited
ten years later here you are again
yes  here i am again
no
i think i got one today
five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids
i hate bishops  they're useless  i like knights
that's ancient history  that has nothing to do with you and i
they're worth less points
so?
i didn't notice them
when i first saw them i thought they were married
how do you know they're not?
i went into their room this afternoon
what?
it was no big deal  i saw them leave i went in
jesus if someone had 
nobody ever sees me
again?  i didn't wanna do it the first time
forget about me are you a puppet for dela?
why in the hell would you take that chance?
i heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them  i wanted to so i did
thank you
isn't it interesting though?  i mean look at us in this room  or yesterday when we were walking in the plaza market  i mean we look like just another couple  but what are we?  doesn't it seem so crazy?
no
no?
it's always been that way  the world has always functioned on two levels
i know  it makes me crazy
why?
i don't know  when i was in college i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor
don't try to change to the subject
and you were drilling these holes?
so i could watch the girl that lived under me
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of selfpreservation
did he explain how this happened?
he believed it all went back to one night when as a little girl  i watched my parents have this big fight really big  i thought my mother was going to kill my father then they went into their room and made up  and i watched them make love through the keyhole
what?
that's a ridiculous move
why?
because i'll take it
why don't you answer?
i'm playing white remember  you can't tell me which pieces to move it doesn't work that way
i'm sure you will
am i attractive?
are you attracted to me?
yes
why?
why?  i don't know
is it a physical thing or a mental thing?
both
i didn't want to complicate the situation
i know i won't be your puppet
attraction is a complication?
it can be
it happened to you before?
yes
who was she?
someone like me like you  a pro
what happened to her?
she was taken
did you 
no  i tried to stop it  i couldn't
you can go now
was she the only one?
after her i realized that to survive i had to live without it's dangerous to let things become complicated
is this becoming complicated?
i'm not sure that i care anymore
no
when did it start?
honestly?
uhhuh
when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me
maybe you should see a psychiatrist
i wuz leaving anyway for good
why?
that doesn't sound normal
i'm not normal
i know  that's why i'm attracted to you  i mean you make me nervous you're intimidating  maybe it's my curiosity/selfpreservation thing but all i can really think about right now is kissing you
martin
what?
i waited another four minutes
shit
wait until he is on the stairs
right
good morning
i'm taking off my mike
okay
electra 
what?
last night 
yes
oh god  i see it
the point is they are paying for information  real information  not tooth paste brands  not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper  and no 16 hours of recorded phone sex you are wasting everyone's time with this shit
i thought it was interesting 
god damnit electra  this is not a game  this is business
where are you bound for?
right  in my hands i have five backup disks he made of all of his work last night
jesus  why didn't you tell me?
i'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus
electra 
a pleasure doing business with you
yes  please come in
how can a beautiful man like you be shy?
i'd love one  whatever you're having
holidays are our busiest days  no one likes to be alone on holidays i know i don't
i think you're supposed to answer that question
that is none of your business
i called because i just want i need to talk
honesty
everyone regrets something
but when you finlsh a job afterwards do you think about them?
sometimes
do you think about their wives or their families?
no  they call me i don't call them  if they didn't call i wouldn't exist
all the time
can you tell me about it?
do you believe that?
is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
are you asking me if i believe in another life?
yes
anytime
just a little ways  up to those trees
sure
funny i've never been a talker my wife was always getting on me about that  'say what you feel tell me what's bothering you you ve got to talk to me'  i never would though  not really
why not?
i don't know  part of me wanted to but part of me always said 'what's she going to be able to do?'  i don't know  maybe i didn't trust her
it's possible
you're pretty famous aren't you?
i am butcher
not at all sir  i have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution and are ready to do it again
i hope not
i know this may seem like a strange question but can i ask you how much the contract was for  not to insult you or anything i know you're a professional but just for me i was just wondering
it's a common question
oh yeah?  i guess we still need to see that price tag  like art right?  you hang some painting that looks like babypuke in your living room only if it costs a bundle
a dime
one hundred thousand?  that's it? jesus is that a lot?
average
shit oh well
taken
'taken'  that's nice  when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them
if you're insulted and not satisfied remember there's two of us best
everyone who plays the game knows the rules
that's exactly what i told myself
that's what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
right
i thought that i would be thinking about margaret or work or that i'd be having these deep profound and depressing thoughts but i'm not  i'm trying to think really profound thoughts but i can't it seems very funny to me
what are you thinking about?
i'm thinking about moonpies  ain't that funny?  i haven't had a moonpie since i was ten years old right now i'm thinking how much i'd love one
and an rc
go ahead
what do other guys do?
i'm not afraid of highwaymen  my man is armed and so am i
do they get down on their knees begging and crying?
some
when i thought about this that was always there in the back of my head that image of me on my knees crying  it wouldn't go away and it would really upset me it was something that i could never get away from but now i feel it's okay  i feel good
can i ask you a question?
anything
why didn't you fade?
you mean quit?
yeah
i used to think about it  i had margaret  she wanted kids  i thought about moving somewhere far away like europe  i could see all of that the first part the getting away but i couldn't see that next part  'then what?' so i'd stop thinking about it and go back to work  you understand?
yeah
you know the use of arms very well best and no one can doubt your courage; but michael and i will see you home for all that
no
that's correct
how would you like the funds?
american currency
this will take some time
i have all day
i'm sorry but i am waiting for an associate  can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
of course senor
thank you
and pay for their drinks occasionally
ten sir and make them short ones do you hear captain grogan?
a coke if they have it?
hey doug you want a beer?
naz draviwhat do you like about this place these people chris?
i don't know it's kind of underground doug's right there's too much crap in this town
i used to think he was right about a lot of things but now i don't know i thought he was going somewhere but now i think i am wasting my time
no you guys are great together he'll come through i'm sure
it's okay they're training me on the cash register and after i hope to work on one of the jewellery counters
sounds cooldo you think he's serious about squatting a place?
i don't know i don't care i see too much of him and he's changed he used to be busy at the magazine but now he's been doing nothing for months like he doesn't care about anything including me
well he sure seems fired up all of a sudden
don't bully mr best  here are the pistols  god bless you my boy; and when i count three fire
it won't last believe me and you when will you go back to the states?
i don't know maybe i'll enrol for postgrad' studies next autumn
like you?
no better than me you know i have many friends you should meet more of them
what's that? a democrat with an attitude
yeah group bloody therapy time
son of the american ambassador and a banker  good enough?
wanker more like what does he know about writing
yeah righti don't know something isn't right with this place it's all too sterile and staged do you ever wonder why there's no czechs here?
because it's in english?
i'll tell you what it is mr dugan i have had enough of miss dugan here and your irish ways  i ain't used to 'em sir
yeah but it's not just that to the czech mind any movement whether political or literary should be underground if it isn't then it's not radical and not worthy of a lookin
but we are underground?
no you don't get it every cabby in town knows this joint so where's the mystery the danger?
and not even then sometimes
we're only jokingit is your round though
well this place is too expensive so you've had it
you're outnumbered kat two to one got to go with the majority that's democracy
yeah let's check out the lowlife
no just crap i want some picture frames
never heard of kmart?
well well  what is it?  we'll make you used to our ways or adopt english ones
yeah and they manage to go to bourgeois joints
what's that? free
just because they've got a choice of four mcdonalds doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger
give'em a break doug all it takes is a little work
that's lubosh the greatest fiddle player in prague you must have seen him playing with johnny on the bridge come on let's grab a table
what did the beer cost?
fifteen crowns
this place is getting expensive too used to be twelve
still fifty cents ain't bad
an alternative literary venue
it's not the english way for ladies to have two lovers and so mr dugan i'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me and i resign all claims to this young lady  if she has a fancy for schoolboys let her take 'em sir
i ain't sure poetry will go down too well here
no it's the whole idea behind it how did they get this place?
squatted it
right and not just the bar lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building
so? doug well there's tons of empty buildings  why don't we get one?
you've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary right katka?
maybe but someone's got to make a stand
like custer huh?
these guys think the west is just mtv and hollywood movies we've got to show them there's more to it
care to elaborate?
pooh  pooh  best you are joking
well providing we're treated like czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned we should be in the clear; at least doug  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs
amazing he didn't even say "if"
no "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch do you want to know what the icing is?
well it's like i said there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city so they're not private now jahn here is an drama student at the university he knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre  they even began work on it until they ran out of money
puppet theatre don't you need something a little bigger?
it's big right jahn?
we could make a run for it?
no thanks i think we ought to get going though
i don't know man i'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime but this is different
damn right it is it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change to leave our mark on this town hell you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a led zep' song  c'mon don't run out on me now
you're a butcher?  what do you use pig intestines for?
i never was more in earnest
alright i give in but let's not end up in jail okay?
you got my word on it
great let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow catch you later partner
yeah that could be job number two i think it's a sewer
he was an electrician?
no he was talking about girls i think
that makes you an expert i guess
too rightnow the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble can you make a start on that?
don't worry i'll give you a hand as soon as i can
scout around and see if there's something check that other corridor if there's nothing nip out and buy a broom and shovel
what is your uncle's name?
and put it on expenses?
sureas for the crap i've got an idea
so?
well we might as well start filling it in now as long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe  so i can get to it we're set use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space  we'll neaten it up later
you sure got a handle on that word "we"
yeah you're in luck there's two of them the other's in there
later mate right now i've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time
i thought that was part of the charm
i'll drill the locks and replace the barrels that way it won't cost so much
a locksmith too? why d'you ever bother with writing?
o'grady
i'm making history chris nothings going to stop me there could be a knighthood for us in this once president havel hears
i'll settle for a pardon you gotta drill?
nobut i think honza at the office has you keep shifting this crap and i'll take care of the locks shouldn't take long take a break for lunch and i'll catch you up later
and if the police stop by  what do i tell them?
tell them we're working for the university
thought of everything haven't you
yep except a name for this place
you're nuts man katka's right
no just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment that's all
well don't get carried away
oh yes of course ambassador o'grady
i'll try not to i'll leave that to you anyway there's still plenty more of it
good i love swinging a shovel
'cause you stink of booze
yeah that was honza's idea i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear
tough break
nope not even close i've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though
really "the freeman centre"?
nothe asylum
oh yeah what's my connection to that?
none it's mine  you said it earlier i'm nuts
this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland  corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach
i've been saying that since we met
yes but it suddenly clicked this is going to be a crazy place and since the commies are used to seeking asylum we can use that in the marketing
yeah i'm beginning to see that
just save me a little patch and i'll do it later
can you do the lock on it?
no it's welded uplet's take a look from the inside
but how did the wall get here?
i don't know this wall isn't like the rest though it's not all that old either
don't we have enough already?
it must be fair old size suppose it's empty?
do you want to see the loveliest woman in europe?
and suppose a little old lady lives there?
no way it's sealed  if she's in there she's dead
sounds like a good reason to leave it alone
just think though it would make a hell of a cafe that way we keep the auditorium clear
why how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
i'll rig up something don't worry  do you think i could bash through with that little hammer?
i don't know doug we haven't even got the place together and already you want to extend it
don't worry if the old lady's there i'll brick it back up
is it gone fourthirty?
yeah i'll take some
the place seems more a farm than an innyard
see if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls give it a bit of atmosphere
you'd be better off with tables and chairs
we got a party tomorrow night can't have the place smelling like shit
i had a better idea we'll burn them there's a drum across the road; i was just waiting for the workers to go home
destroy the evidence huh
have you ever stolen anything?
nope
could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
like helping a sick kid?
no for the asylum
the people are great farmers as well as innkeepers
close
just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better
what's that five instead of ten years jail
they'll never get us
it looks new they might miss one or two
we're going to need it all
jesus doug they'll execute us
stealing's stealing we might as well get what we need this'll do for the floor and the walkway too
not yet we need a few lengths of scaffold
why don't we just take the whole damn building brick by brick doug
it was my joke  i was tired and did not care to go farther  there's not prettier woman here than that if she won't suit your fancy my friend then you must wait awhile
look at it this way it's their contribution if we'd explained it to them they'd probably have given it to us anyway
so why didn't we?
we don't speak czech
am i late?
no not if you've got better things to do
who put a bee up your butt?
when your ready son
well i think i_ve got a handle on the czech pysche and i reckon this kind of joint will make _em reminisce about the sixties plus we should get a few stray expat_s looking for kafka
sure i think it_s your turn to buy too
you should have said it was bringabottle
i have acted as i think fit
no i figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk they'll all want to help we should have that floor done in a day or so
no beer?
not on the opening night wouldn't look right
why don't we go together?
no it could take me hours you know what it's like trying to find things in this town not to mention disposable stuff  i wouldn't think they've ever heard of them
both see you later
forget it doug it's no good
no not yet
you're all bloody useless
we could make a start on the floor afterwards
you stuff sausage in it
sir i'm a british officer
no we aren't going to do it
what?
i can't i've got to split i have to take a class at two o'clock
i fell in love
and a tram hit you?
no the boyfriend
what happened to katka?
didn't i tell you she dumped me monday night
you romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes  anyone i know?
holly
it's a lie  you're a deserter you're an impostor sir; your lies and folly have confirmed this to me you pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know  will you join and take the bounty sir or will you be given up?
couldn't keep your hands off the hired help huh?
it just happened
she's as american as apple pie too have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
she's cool
a fine specimen for conversion
what are you on about?
well i take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset
yeah and i got the bruises to prove it so what?
nothing it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong
what?
neither
take the drill back to honza at the office i promised to get it back for the weekend and i don't want to show my face there
you might make henry happysure i'll do it
good and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs it'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven holly and i'll go and get some beer and wine  can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
you capitalist pig
the performance is free what more do you wanti've set that old phone up as a donation box and i'll get jahn to write out a signokay let's get going
hey jahnyou got a name for this thing?
he's lying i am
tell me some bad news?
i don't want to ruin your day
that bad?
how do you do sir?
your too good for this town buddy
so i hear
huh?
i had a visit from the british embassy they think i'm a stray soccer hooligan
they ain't the only ones
he got that one right
honza says they'll print an open letter to president havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walkout
no but i ran into jahn seems him and his friends are in big trouble with the university they might even be expelled
damn
did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well  and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed depend on it your reward will be your discharge from the army and a bounty of 100 guineas
yeah i tell you they're one big happy family over there
what happened?
i don't know i'm waiting for the transcript
you're kidding
well the trial's in two weeks but i think they've already sentenced me they just need to check if siberia can slot me in
we gotta think of something
now you're using that word
i could try and get a western lawyer
so?
well it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files
what is the service sir?
lucky break
maybe but i've started to wonder what those files were all about suppose it was old kgb stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police that might explain all the hassle and the coverup
did you see anything in the files?
it was all in czech wasn't it
what happened to those disks i gave you have you still got them?
yeah somewhere?
suppose those contained all the file info too? you could have a third or so of it there
do you want me to see what's on them?
no point it'll be in czech and god knows what format but if i'm right they could be my ticket out of here
and if you're wrong
there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the spur  he is made for good society polished obliging a libertine without prejudices fond of women of good food of high play prudent and discreet
siberia
what do you want me to do?
get me one of the disks ask a czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to reuters and be ready to send it if this doesn't work you'd better keep clear of your apartment too do you know someone with a phone?
yeah dave walters
good what's his number?
42 56 76 okay you wait at dave's for my call tomorrow if you don't hear from me by three o'clock send that note and get out of the country fast
doug i can't just leave you
you're in the clear keep it that way i'll be okay
sureanything else i can do for you?
you could give me your baseball so i can drive this bastard nutshe's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game
only a very little as soldiers do
some deal you did there
i should have read the fine print  i love you holly thanks
here
i'm not hungry really
we ain't going to give it away this time are we?
look i don't care whether you go with doug or not but you_ve got to see him before he leaves
listen doug took the rap for us all so grab your coat 'cause you're going
what?
it was a condition of getting doug out
what are you talking about?
i had thought you more expert  you must find out if the chevalier cheats  he sees the english and austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house  find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole  if you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself  we look at them there  but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger  he sleeps with the keys of his dispatchbox with a string around his neck  twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys
in return for doug's freedom i was never to see him again i had to  it was his only chance
josh didn't get doug out of jail he did a deal in return for some computer disks we'd held onto
no
you're sure?
sure i'm sure
do you know the way?
sure it's on the red metro line you
no by road?
yeah pretty well
good we'll take josh's jeep come on
i am not sure  the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it
that one?
yeah
okay but i don't want to miss him
follow that budjovice sign
yeahshit those guys have guns
doug?
turn around quick
i'm just here to record some details standard stuff
you mean your not going to spring me?
so am i
and what do you do with the bones?
not yet but i believe he intends to
now  your name is douglas greenwell yes?
yes
date of birth november the fourth nineteensixtytwo
yes
your home address is 18 thornton avenue coventry
that's my mum's
i see would you like us to inform her of your situation?
no
now have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
no
and his baggage?
well i'll try and get that clarified as i understand it though the charges include break and enter theft trespass operating an unlicensed facility vandalism and destruction of government documents  whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
they didn't look like medical files to me
well a plea of ignorance won't go far here frankly i think you deserve everything that's coming
regards to her majesty
sure they wanted to know if i ever voted conservative
doug haven't seen you for a while
i've been around
have you met holly? josh's friend
no look lawrence i've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and i'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off it's going to be for alternative arts but i need some help to finish it off can you put the word out?
sure excellent
oh  that will be sent after him  i have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers you say; and at noon after parade shall be at the inn  you will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair and will wait for me at the chevalier's rooms until my arrival  we must force that box  you are a clumsy hound or you would have got the key long ago
here's the details
hmm i see possibilities but you got a lot to do
we should be done by the weekend
really?
i could pencil you in if you like?
i'll take a raincheck for now
yeah maybe
shhhhh i'm concentrating
i think he's jealous of havel
ooh well excuse me
the man that marries dorothy dugan must first kill me  do you mind that?
you used to read
well not any more now i'm a serious writer and above this crap
i'll get the drinks but not here let's split i can't stand this any more it's murdering my respect for literature
but i don't want to go i am enjoying it
how about you brutus?
i don't care i'm not staying out late doug
whatever
what?
you're everything a guy could want
no i'm not i came to prague looking for something  this could be it
faith i think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word
what? you are crazy
look just hear me out okay?
look kat it'll only take ten minutes without jahn i might never find it we'll just have a quick look and then you and i'll hit a tram
don't worry it's okay
okay whatever come on chris
alright i'm coming it's the perfect place jahn thanks
i'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening i'm going to make that place into something big god i love you
we should go to the metro it's quicker
nonsense we can pick up the tram on the other side it won't take any longer come on
so we won't be going to london?
and so i am
no not just yet
everybody is at home it's no good
let's have a look anyway
it's bad news when you can't even bribe kids
no way doug i can't
yeah you're right i've got an idea
fernet and tonic
no
i thought you loved me doug but all you want from me is sex
oh sure and you will want sex always sex
and this is the return you make for his kindness  didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died and hasn't he given you and your mother rentfree your fine house of jamesville yonder?
i'm not a bloody teenager okay i told you i can't do that shit
that's it i am just stupid teenager yes?
right now yeah  you're talking crap
then tell me what will happen? tell me
look i love you katka but i'm twelve years older i could never marry you it'd be stupid you know that
thanks
i hope so
i'm no good for you katka besides i won't be able to stay in prague
but we could go to london and live in england
no kat i lied to you i hate england and i don't ever want to live there again
mark this come what will of it i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan  i'll follow him if it's into the church and meet him there i'll have his blood or he shall have mine  will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting?
there's nothing there for me
i'm sorry about what i said really i am just take me with you i don't care where
but i love you
no it's not true you're lying
not this time kat
and since it's only two streets away i suggest we go take a look now
don't worry i've got lots of friends
sure i've done it easily
hey chris keep an eye on things
later jahn i've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring they brought the materials but took my money and ran you guys have a school theatre don't you?
well if it must be it must  for a young fellow you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw  no officer bearing his majesty's commission can receive a glass of wine on his nose without resenting it  fight you must and best is a huge strong fellow
yes the obelisk but it's closed for repairs
so i hear do you know some of the stage hands?
sure they are students
well i want them to put down a floor and a walkway
it's not so much
look if you can get them to finish it by friday you and your friends can do the opening performance that night

donations only and make the thing nonlingual so everyone gets a handle on it
yep it's all yours
okay
he'll give the better mark  i am not afraid of him
great and your all set for the performance?
yeah it's a simple piece if they get the floor done in time me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon but it's not critical
don't go making it too simple we're on the cutting edge here
don't worry thanks
greathow long will it go for?
about forty minutes
coolso if we say eight o'clock
yo dobree
yeah greatdobchay it will dry yes?
yes of coursemaybe one hour

good greatdobchay
it's perfect you've done a great job
ah so what?
that's only the half of it i've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
how?
i'm in close with these guys it isn't easy but slowly they're opening up to me give me a month and i'll blow their movement wide open
a month jesus and how do i know you're not crapping me?
you can hold back this months paycheck until i come through with the story
what paycheck? you ain't done nothing
henry i've been working my tail off on this look all i need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop it'll send those scumbags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the bugler and your board of directors back home
the meeting is arranged  captain best is waiting for you now
i got a bad feeling about this how much do you need?
two hundred dollars make it six thousand crowns?

that's not what you said last night and i didn't bring that "prick" josh
thanks
the way i look at it i've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under  if it doesn't drink now we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day
your cousins go out with him
well i've failed at everything else i've done and i can't hack it as a journalist even for the bugler
what's the bugler?
it's a student magazine networked through eastern europe and funded by republican dogooders back in the states
i figured you more as a socialist?
i moving more to communism now it's dying out
a champion of lost causes huh?
no i'm just running scared same as everyone else
we_re not all running away
i know some are trapped usually by money
yeah we'd better keep them for now i'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night
it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck  he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly  but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize
yeah seems okay
no just a coffee
one beer one coffee thanks
i'll be okay just get me home
i had it coming from someone

that's right
you will wish you hadn't

it was the biggest i could find
what was the real purpose behind this venture?
a kind of freedom
either you're a liar or you are a fool

we'll have to see what more we can do for you while you are still our guest
thanks but i don't intend to stay
really
i lied to you i didn't destroy the floppy disks
not all of them
i didn't get to see what's on the disks but i can guess do you want to hear my terms or not
first i want to walk free with a letter in english from the prosecutor general dropping all charges second i want two first class tickets to london leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope lastly all actions against the students are to be stopped
the choice is yours it's not negotiable
i have the director's word there will be no action against them you may go once we have the disks
how do i know this isn't a trap?
i'll match any man with the sword
you have the letter and my word if you wish you may wait upstairsnow where are the disks?
i'll need to make a phone call
you may use my office
yeah

good wait here it will not take long and then you may go
yes you are free to go karel here will drive you home
i insist it is the least we can do
workingunder cover

yeah

maybe it is
oh that's it? everything i do is crap

well come on sit down
later
okay honey but don't be long i got plans
it must have been some other gate

well for a start you've got to get cleaned up
why?
it's time to go home holly
leave me just leave me alone josh
go to hell
it's more than what you're worth
you bastard
yeah and you're a slut so what?
don't you dare i'll be back
a man of honor dies but never apologizes  i'll see the captain hanged before i apologize
josh i have to speak you it's urgent
of course darling you'd like to apologise?
can we talk in your office?
josh i need your help doug's been arrested he's in big trouble i thought maybe your father and the embassy might be able to do something
you really are a piece of work you know that? you walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up
yes if you can get him free
alright i'll see to it and things'll be just as they were okay?
this press we cannot control americans i think
you know everyone can be controlled pavel where are you storing the personnel files?
in a building belonging to the university in the old town
i had news of you in dublin  faith you've begun early like your father's son but i think you could not do better than as you have done but why did you not write home to your poor mother?  she has sent halfadozen letters to you in dublin
you are quite sure it's secure?
the files are in a sealed room and the university are under strict orders to stay away
the storage facility will be ready within a week i'll call you then
we're not sure
the building has been occupied and the locks have been changed
the university cannot do this is the room safe?
yes i think so it is still barred but it is not the university who are in the building
some americans?
i don't understand it there were a lot of people there last night many americans i believe we should move carefully
i don't think you realise what will happen if those files are made public the lives of thousands of officers depend on the secrecy of those records including your own now
i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office
that was not my decision i can only guess that one day we will again be active and our honour restored in the meantime no one else must know those files exist secure the building and i will arrange alternative safe storage immediately
and what of these foreigners?
i don't care about americans arrest them all if you have to but keep those records secret
all the more reason to eliminate him
what if his accomplices have made copies?
it was all on a russian format i don't think that would be so easy; we must take that chance
very well
subtitles) you have made many mistakes pavel let there be no more for your sake
with you
i don't dance
we must write to her today and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "brown bess"
heart be still
because she doesn't know what a hint is
i'll tell her you were here
i'm sorry about how we 
no you're with who you should be it's like she chose you
and i have no idea why
i do
kelly wouldn't do that
why not?
cuz nothing happened at school
is miss dugan well?
you don't need a car you can't drive for a month go see marvin
'bout what?
about a job
i don't want his money
it could help with a new car 
 i like the car i have
that's over way over
i can't know things if you don't tell me
we talked he wanted to get a bite  after i said no
after he moved out i invited him to every practice every game every parentteacher conference you ever had he didn't show not once
there's only six miss dugans now poor dorothy
he wants to show now
you going to let him? you going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
you're fine like that mom
there's hot cider in the kitchen
thanks
i haven't seen clay or eric lately
me neither
no i won't be long
late night  you?
were you with jamie?
good heavens  whatever?  has she died of grief?
yeah
you sleeping with her?
i could take after dad too
you do you're handsome and charming
i meant he's a doctor
that's eight years of school and training  after college and all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being
i could do it if i tried even kelly thinks so
that'd be something
whatever my life is i'm going to be friggin' sure i'm never disappointed 
mom great but what i want is for me to be proud of me
she took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband  she is now mrs john best
i didn't know either
landon 
it was the only thing i've ever asked him
be yourself and i don't think there is a wrong thing  let jamie take the lead she'll let you know what she needs
he wants to talk to you
now it's okay?
landon you have two parents we're both here for you even 
landon honey there's nothing more
i need to whizz
no thinking the doctor only gives you three seconds to decide 
god you're just like him just keep me locked away in the dark so i can't experience anything for myself
look asshole  i've been threatened by better than you
mrs john best  was there another mr john best?
i'm just wondering 
you do 
and you don't  what's she doing in there?
york ave
demented
she's not she's got her own ideas
it was
scamming's a strong word
later
no hey we're sorry man
no the very same one my boy  he recovered from his wound  the ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him  it was only made of tow do you think the dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred ayear out of the family?  the plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way for the cowardly englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you  but hit him you certainly did roderick and with a fine thick plugget of tow and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to we told your mother the story afterwards and a pretty scene she made
landon carter i was driving the car that 
you
me
what kind of a man are you son?
no thanks gotta keep my wits for the drive home
 this your idea of small talk?
i don't make small talk 
 obviously
were?
you don't know me
the coward
your book and your brown sweater and your hair what's more to know  ?
 i wear the sweater because i'm cold i read because no one talks to me my hair is my hair what is it exactly that's bothering you?
like what? the moons of jupiter?
can't you have a normal conversation?
i don't want to have any conversation
good cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person
'they won't'
'believe in yourself and they will let me ask you lizzie look in the mirror? are you pretty ?'
'yes you'reyou're bb beautiful'
 this play means a lot to me
he has paid off your uncle's mortgage  he gave dorothy a coach andsix  that coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family  faith the business was well done  your cousins michael and harry never let him out of their sight though he was for deserting to england until the marriage was completed and the happy couple off on their road to dublin  are you in want of cash my boy?  you may draw upon me for i got a couple of hundred out of master best for my share and while they last you shall never want
this play  ?
 i know you don't suck at acting
 your act only works with an audience
my act?
then we both know  i'll point you drive faster
why?
because that's where the fire is?
like me
no not like you
so you agree you need help?
i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls
28 is do something illegal 42 is befriend an enemy
i'm an enemy?
kinda yeah
good thing
are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
maybe a little of both
go for it
it's like a todo list but for my life
it's private
you want to tell me
mr o'higgins we are in your debt and rest assured sir you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin  mister o'higgins i wonder if i know your good father?
spend a year in the peace corps make a medical discovery 
ambitious
i do know  be two places at once learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel eat breakfast with chopsticks
and you have to meet my father
don't bother
he's a softy got him wrapped around my finger
you think so
know so
yeah maybe i dunno
do you think i'm strange?
which o'higgins do you know?  for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family
the world of the dead?
could be
that is my telescope
before voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings 
but there are thousands of them made of floating ice 
maybe debris from a moon that broke apart
or building blocks for a world that never formed
looking for something  someone
i hope so  i think maybe she sees me now
the dirty snowball at its core
oh i am thinking of the o'higgins of redmondstown  general o'higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father colonel granby somerset
yeah  i'm probably not going to be around next time it comes
in 76 years me neither
in ten words or less?
yeah
my relationship with god is my own
but you think about him  it  her
don't you?
do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
no
i know there's a plan for everyone but sometimes i don't understand what the message is  or what the point is
ah  i see  no i'm afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown
there is no point you live you die the end
you don't believe in anything?
the bible why should i read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles

i'm really glad you think so

sirrah  sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland

you don't know the first thing about being someone's friend 
i don't want to be just your friend 
you don't know what you want 
you don't either take a look at yourself maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you 
and why would that scare me?
because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your god

where?
tut tut  i can play at fencing as well as you mr roderick james ah  you change color do you?  your secret is known is it?  you come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the o'higgins of castle o'higgins; i introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; i take you to my tradesmen who give you credit  i accept your note for near two hundred pounds and what do i find?  a fraud
you're straddling the state line you're in two places at once

'find out who you are and do it on purpose' dolly parton
that was read at my parents' wedding
better i was really angry
because you have hope that you'll get better?
no  maybe i believe god has a bigger dream for me than i had for myself  maybe i believe the journey the big adventure never ends

you'll be fine for a few minutes
landon i can't even do for myself
but if you could you would?
yes
i'll meet you on one condition  i get exclusivity and you surrender to me

he wants help with his lines 
jamie he's careless reckless  is this really the best time to be making a new friend?
i'm supposed to always be alone?
i don't want you to see him outside school activities
fine but i need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life
dad i've become a woman without her just not a pretty one
up to?
i thought we had rid ourselves of his disagreeable companionship
no
i saw the way he looked at you the way he kissed you
you are going to drive to the frontier
it was a play
boys like him have  expectations
i have expectations too
dad 
it's time to tell him  it would be the right thing
no i want what's best for you
this  him  landon  is what's best for me
jamie you're not mad at me you're mad at landon 
i am mad at you and at landon and the universe and god  i don't even know where to put all my anger
that's normal god accepts your anger he won't punish you
it is shameful  infamous  i insist upon being put down at the austrian ambassador's house
by making me ill he is punishing me  i just don't know what for
i was wrong nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did not even god
lead man
let's get something straight you don't know me i don't know you but i know what you're about  keep your distance from this house  and from jamie
does it have to do with jamie?
yes sir
that won't be possible
i don't want to see her hurt
ever again
no
i have orders to gag your honor if you cry out and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not
so talk to us about something
like what sir?
you decide
okay sure  my grandfather when he was seven he shook the hand of an old guy a war vet or something who had once shaken president lincoln's hand  made a big impression on him
your parents are divorced?
since i was five my mom's a cocktail waitress
how do you  the two of you  get by?
materially or spiritually?
either both
how  how long does she have?
ten thousand?  but the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand
praying

if there is a god how could he let this happen??
i'm not tired
i need to be with her
in there
i'm using an old phonographic turntable
for the focuser?
i helped jamie with the first one
i thought she built it herself
your honor must lower his voice
she did but hardly anyone does anything truly alone
yes you?
getting by
yes
jamie wanted that she told me
she did it was you
i'm no dummy
that's right you just act like one
that's right  the world is your oyster
i want to come back
all europe shall hear of this
i'd do that 
how would you do that mr carter?
please
besides attending all your regular classes i'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school

it was marty's turn to be confused huh?
lemme see that
bic it's a bic pen
you're not gonna hurt me just hit me in the stomach
look marty i'm just not a fighter
but i've never picked a fight in my entire life
you're not picking a fight you're coming to her rescue maybe we'd better go over the plan again where are you gonna be at 8:55?
i'm going to be at the dance
and where am i gonna be?
in the parking lot with her
only the agency of servants
why?
why what?
why is she gonna get angry with you?
george it's not your concern don't worry about it just remember that at 9:00 you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us  struggling in the car you'll run over open the door and say?
oh uh 'hey you get your damn hands off her'  george paused you really think i should swear?
yes definitely god dammit george swear then you hit me in the stomach i go down for the count and you and eileen life happily ever after now hit me in the stomach
no george just concentrate on the anger anger
not a holocaust 
mr mcfly here wants to nuke it all just so he can see it
all i can say is that's one helluva attitude mr mcfly 'let's explode a hundred megaton geothermal nuclear device just to see it'
i'd give five years of my life to see the old country again the greenfields and the river and the old round tower and the burying place
unfortunately the way things are going you may get your wish you may see the entire annhiliation of the world if not you'll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources we can already see the air we breathe not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes we'll  see all of our oil reserves depleted in fact all of our energy sources yes you people have a lot to look forward to  a lot to see
hey mr arky gimme a break  i'm seventeen years old i'm not responsible for all these problems
uh  yeah i'm new here and i'm supposed to be in this class
marty marty lewis
you're the only mr lewis in this class  if you have something to say say it so the whole class can hear
well yeah i was thinking if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas like what if we run out?
run out of gas?
operator listen this is an emergency i have to make this call but i don't have a dime  all i got is a nickel  but you gotta connect me 
sir it only costs a nickel
what?
i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill
local calls cost five cents what number do you want?
five cents please
operator what's today's date?
march 11th
what year?
nineteen fifty 
what's this all about?
no no not beyond an acceptable level have you been xrayed recently martin?
home school here 
yeah  right
we will practice in the mornings my boy and i'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing
pro release the rope
shhhhhhhh
that reminds me if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain i've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house  we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater
a 35mm film chain i'll see what i can do
nope the way i figure it doors are made to be opened see you after school
oh  marty  what time did you say it was?
am or pm?
pro the sun's out
oh right right 
jeez for a guy with a ton of clocks you sure don't pay much attention to time
what?  it doesn't work that way
have no fear  it will come out well for me
to be traveled through
get behind the shield i'm about to release radiation
then where the hell is he?
the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he you see shemp has just become the world's first time traveller i've sent shemp into the future  two minutes into the future to be exact
the future? what are you talking about? where's shemp?
shemp is right here in this roomtwo minutes from now and at exactly 9:02pm we'll catch up to him
now hold on a minute professor hold the phone are you trying to tell me that this  all of this here  that this is  it's a  a 
precisely 
why?
is shemp all right?
i believe they will deport you
professor can this thing send shemp back in time?
sure listen  we take the racing results from today's paper
so what? we'd be rich
don't you understand? the mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events and changing history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear
the future marty the future is everything i built this machine to see the future so i am going to send shemp twentyfour hours into the future you can assist me if you like
sure he agreed quickly
you know me?
ssshhhhh
marty
uh marty lewis i almost didn't recognize him  haven't seen him in years
i have faced that problem before
must have been? used to live? i do live here
oh yeah
a mall?
yeah a shopping mall you know a shopping mall?
you didn't professor it was an accident you see what happened 
no don't tell me  i don't want to know the future my knowledge of future events your mere presence here could have devastating effects on the course of history and altering history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear my immediate response is to send you back to your own time
oh that expression probably hasn't been invented yet i can get behind  i agree with you
the power converter
of course the power converter it works of course it works  what chemicals do we use?
blast it  no i suppose you're right you do know the proper chemical formula?
but if they send you away then what is to become of me?
just a guess i figured kids would still be drinking coke in 1982
we don't
that's just great
you were ringing the doorbell
what if you lost your keys?
then i would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history don't you understand? the fabric of history is very delicate anything you do could have serious consequences
hey look gimme a break all i did was answer the door how's that gonna change history?
i don't know but i don't want to take any chances now you stay here and don't do anything don't answer the door don't answer the phone don't go outside understand?
okay professor i get where you're coming from the way i look the way i'm dressed  i'd stick out like a sore thumb
professor be serious would you?
make your mind easy you shall not be left behind i warrant you  do take a last look at your barracks make your mind easy say a farewell to your friends in berlin  the dear souls how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country and out of it you shall go
i am serious if we could get you the time machine and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast we could send you back to the future
you're talking crazy an atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds
you forget  time travel is instantaneous the time machine would melt but you would have already travelled through time of course it's a moot point regardless the only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the army's nevada test site and those tests are kept absolutely top secret
oh  that  i found it in the closet
i don't recall ever seeing it before
well it was there
curious very curious
you did what??
you better make sure your old man asks her out because if he doesn't they may never have a first date and if they don't have a first date they won't have a second date if they don't have a second date they won't fall in love if they don't fall in love they won't get married and if they don't get married you'll never be born
i brought it with me from 1982 it's from my science book
but how sir?
believe me professor running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what i've been doing
but that's impossible george asked her out he had to i saw him walk her home oh god
my guess is that she turned him down
but why? why would she do that? she's supposed to marry the guy
apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior
are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
jesus
good professor brown tested the tarp noting in satisfaction that it was secure i'll pick you up in front of the school at midnight don't be late  we're cutting it close as it is we've got a long drive ahead of us
nobody said anything about hitting her you're just going to take a few liberties with her
that's exactly what i said i mean a guy and his mother  that's illegal isn't it?
then ordering fresh horses the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital  i need not tell you that i was the chevalier
look marty she's not your mother yet and if you don't go through with this she may never be i know it's hard but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant some choices must be made that are difficult nonetheless we must make them besides this may be more than a simple question of your own existence he added the fate of the entire spacetime continuum may rest on your shoulders  marty tried to smile at him
that's just what i needed to hear
it'll be fine marty  you'll be fine good luck he stuck his hand out and marty shook it but there was still a question that was nagging at him
professor if something does go wrong tonight if i don't get my parents back together when do you think i'd cease to exist?
perfect
it could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future theoretically it could happen at the moment of your birthor conception actually it could happen at any time it's a question to which i hope we'll never learn the answer
nope my father's never clenched a fist in his entire life
curious  very curious
we're at one and a half miles so you're just a little over a mile from where you want to be  wait until minus 3 minutes before you go  that should give you plenty of time and it should be close enough to zero hour that they can't do anything to stop you park the truck at 800 and get in the refri the time chamber just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bombthe power converter will do the rest
professor brown grinned i guess i'll see you in about 30 years
sir we have but eighty thousand florins in bank or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand we will meet you
professor  there are some doors that shouldn't be opened marty said softly without turning around
1982 march 18 just like we planned my calculations were absolutely correct thirty years god i cannot believe it's been thirty years sure it was a long time ago  longest i've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment
what do you call this? 
a car
87 states? time travel bans? what the hell?
according to your girlfriend suzy parker you and she were at the movies you went to the restroom and you never came out obviously you stepped through an interdimensional time warp created by the original operation of the time machine
but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with so don't mention anything about time travel to anyone
what theater was i at?
the orpheum
it's the most beautiful city i've ever seen what is it?
to risk one's life against such people is an imposition
what? 
a tab
sure
dick? dick who?
now who's being stupid? the guy who runs this place
i run this place 
what happened to dick wilson?
dick wilson? dickie wilson? dickie wilson runs this place? that's a laugh
no self confidence i guess at least you don't take after him
yeah jesus i wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom
i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him
no way
me neither i've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married you think yours did?
hell no the way my mom carries on about sex  you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest you shoulda seen her face when i told her we were gonna stay up all night saturday he added always afraid something is going to happen
is  something going to happen saturday night?
hi marty
what did you do to your hair?
what did you do to yours?
well he's gone
gone? where?
he said not to tell
if you don't want my film  i'll call another show  and they will show it
certain?
oh yeah?
yeah he said for you to give us a lift into town you're the ones with the studebaker aren't you?
what's going on?
can't afford to take chances
okay
you don't mind?
yeah
you expect me to believe that?
what do you mean?
not bad
perfectly certain because i shall make him tremble
running this place for a fella in town nothing much to speak of
well i don't notice us hustling trash either
they come with the house
she plays the clarinet too
no he showed me one
okay
i'll catch up with you
okay
sometimes the other day though an old boy was plowing in the field over there found some old spanish coins
kind of round like so gold i'll show you if you want
certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love?
yeah
what do you feed him?
oh flies grasshoppers when i can catch 'em
does he bite?
he never bit me
i used to throw trash for the city
you lost that one?
wouldn't be here if i hadn't
what kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
i can't think of anything at the moment i'd like you to write me out a slip though proving i came down here
perfectly so; and what is more i will tell you that i love her and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals
long as my ammo held out right there's where you caught me
you better not leave that cadillac sitting out here
thirty aught six
you ever had to open it up like that before?
nope
mmmmm
you like people?
they're okay
then why'd you do it?
i don't know always wanted to be a criminal i guess just not this big a one takes all kinds though
very well  now that i know it i will no longer love her
i need to get your signature on some papers here kit
well i've got to read them first suppose i could get a coke while i do?
sure thing come on
sure
tom
good luck to you
thanks
i mean it
i know you do good luck to you too
what'd you come out here for?
then you yield to me
i wasn't aware there was any law against it
is that right?
yeah
well it's not good enough  just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you kit? guy like you
she'd get along okay and if she didn't well she could take off just take off i wouldn't mind i'd always tell people i deserved it
what're you doing?
i've got a gun here sir it's always a good idea to have one around
well i got it all planned and i'm taking holly off with me
for coming onto my property with a gun
no you're not either
on the instant  everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you
yeah? why not?
cause i can't allow it
you have to ask kit he says frog i jump
okay
what's your friend's name?
jack
you love him?
i don't know
yeah i can imagine
well i've felt that way hadn't you?
very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs

holly

it's mine all right
well listen i'm going to swap you my cadillac
name is carruthers believe i shoot people every now and then not that i deserve a medal
just gimme a chance
git
hold it right there
your word "empty" makes me laugh is it fortunate or unfortunate?  if it is fortunate i congratulate myself  if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it
i could've held off an army if i could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains
beats me
wanta sue me?
no
who're you?
new jersey?
fortysix yoyodyne employees  grover's mill new jersey 11/1/38
you mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
halloween 1938"war of the worlds"that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared thinking that real live martians were landing in grover's mill new jersey  but then it all just turned out to be a hoax
then that's it
it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love
nothing to apologize for casper  you've gone beyond the call of duty tonight  mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers?  they'll be worried
you wanna take the chance casper?
not me no way
rawhide go find out how professor hikita's coming with that formula mrs johnson take casper and scooter gas up the jet car
they're stealing my chopper
the creatures?  they attacked you?  they tried to possess you?
buckaroo i've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft
i'm assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock just in case
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part right professor?
carefuldon't make noise and don't touch me  i'm hotter than flapjacks
but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune
what?
i'm a giant semiconductor and there's alien creatures all around us form the eighth dimension i think  look
it's your hand buckaroo
it's an antidote a formula  whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises
arachtoids  from planet ten
planet 10?
there's a harley behind those bushes  get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula  we don't have time to ask questions just synthesize it
got a half a tuna sandwich
same one you had yesterday?
vanished thin air
that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love
have you warned professor hikita?
first thing i did
and his soul black as the ace of spades
he went on a senseless crime spree killed a cop during a bank robbery got caught and judged insane  the professor told us they threw away the key
and try the president's private number at the hospital  make sure this is on the level we're busy people here
buckaroo somebody shanghaied the professor
the deuce you say  that crate
i think i'm on to something you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne
yoyodyne propulsion systems?  you think they're mixed up in this?
yeah just grazed me  the professor's under the floor toowith the overthruster
it is only too possible  love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last
just 'grazed' you huh?
arachtoid
so i was right  that's nice to know
sure do pack a mean walloplet's go
who put this dirty picture in buckaroo's viewer?
not really  this is pretty important
she wants a picture
i look great  let's rock 'n' roll
i'm sure we'll find out soon enough
let her out in my custody
i agree; but god put us on earth to take that risk
let her out?  she's a killer
yeah but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in 1938 at grover's mills new jersey
it?  who does?
what is it tommy?
sam's dead  someone broke into the jet car and things are going haywire over at the lab
where's the professor?
whorfin?  does he know we're coming?
new jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire  quite a guy if you want my opinion
they will never surrender  they will fight to the end
don't look at me buckaroo banzai  i failed flight school
a man may need to do that and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws
the door's locked
at least tell them i'm trying  tell 'em something
boy i hope so buckaroo banzai
now buckaroo banzai?
now
figures  anybody seen my scope?
what? how do you know that?
orson wells?  what about doctor lizardo?
stole his body?  when doctor lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  of course  what else?
to get my guns
i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men
don't shoot
john parker tell them we're doing our best  stall
just their side  what're we gonna do with these people?  they're illegal aliens the way i figure been here forty years you could throw the book at 'em
and ask the american taxpayer to foot the bill?  no way  send 'em back to the eighth dimension as soon as we find the overthruster  it wasn't in penny's purseso if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out
this is so embarrassing
somebody get her a mike? can we manage that?  and a spotlight  what's your name?
penny  i'd rather not reveal my last name or my age
my name is penny penny priddy  there i've said it but it won't mean anything to you  i'm a nobody
did i say anything was wrong? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69 okay? i'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town i can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record  he offered to set me up for life and like a fool well i
he offered you money?
how so?
do i look like that kinda girl?  i lost my room this morning  i don't know where i'm gonna sleep tonight but i keep going  what the hell else can i do?  i've still got my figure and like this bozo said as long as there's a sidewalk i'll always have a job
my name's penny  but who cares?
everybody okay up here?
i guess 'cause you remind me of someone i once knew long ago before any of this craziness
go away  let me rot?
who were you really trying to kill last night?
you  like the papers all say
pretty terrible shot
who?
the girl i remind you of
my father was  he gave me many lessons about fire  now it's my friend
by loving you with no hope of possessing you
she was the queen of the netherlands
it's kinda hard this way
the netherlands  whew that's a long way from wyoming
wyoming? not cody by any chance?
no  laramie  except i was born in cody how did you know that?  oh right sure i forgot: you know everything
no i don't
which?  the one in my throat
i don't know i always felt like i did like there was another me
another 'you'?
somewhere  see i was taken away by the priddies when i was a baby  i was adopted
it is my only object
adopted  i should have know of course if it was a snake it'd bit me
what?  i don't understand you  i don't understand anything anymore
who does?  it's a crazy mixedup world  just do the best you can with what you have
any time
i'll shoot yours off if i had a gun you doubledealing casanova  i thought you liked me for myself  but why should you huh?  a jerk like me
she was killed penny
oh my
don't go to pieces  i haven't got time tonight
where's my damn ammo?  nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here
how did she die?  i wanna know
to make me wretched in two weeks
you don't wanna know
yes i do  gimme a chance  i'm stronger than you think
she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night
hanoi shan?  the guy in your comic books  boss of the world crime league?  supreme commander of the legion of death?  the pivot of mystery himself?  you're putting me on  he's a cartoon character
i wish he was  he's real enough
i gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelingsi've got mixed emotionsi don't know if i can handle this  oh boy
i gotta go  we're on borrowed time
go where?  where're you going?
please penny  you just gotta trust me now  okay?  and don't panic because it's gonna be all right
what?  if we just believe in buckaroo banzai?
to love you until death  to subscribe to all your commands
yeahand maybe more important if you believe in yourself
believe in penny priddy?
absolutely
it's too dangerous
that's just what you would say  this is so unreal  i'm dreaming
sure  i won't hold my breath
penny?  are you all right?
hello mr president  how's my favorite patient?  any tenderness?
that which does not kill us makes us stronger buckaroo  what's it like out there in the real world?
you're gonna have to repeat that i think buckaroo
the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me
a what?
a thermonuclear holocaust sir  these creatures from planet 10 are ready to exploit sovietamerican tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth sir if necessary
you're quite serious about this aren't you buckaroo  we know each other pretty well i think
no sir  i think the flint
what's happening with my call to sac?
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command  they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed
jammed? by who? whom by?
possible atmospheric condition sirsolar  it's unusual but no cause for alarm  intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem
should we be on code red?
nigh on ten years  been through a lotta scrapes together
deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me  if i do not know it i am innocent
what'd you do before?  can i ask?
government work  had my own think tank  got tired of thinkingwanted some action  seen plenty of it too  so will you if you stick around
where's buckaroo?  is he alive?
course he's alive  he's buckaroo banzai
perfect tommy's just threatened by smart women  can you play that thing?
better than him
why me?
i didn't drop 'em
doesn't look anything like her to me
pictures don't lie
but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer
hell they don't i met my first wife that way
it's peggy to these eyes  same nose same hair  plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself right?
you're thinking of mr wizard  this guy's an eccentric genius
hey so was mr wizard
where do you hail from doc?
why me?
cause buckaroo needs me here
no  ditto the professor
asshole probably got lost
whadda you need buckaroo for?
with a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight
flying to cambodia
bet you say that to all the girls perfect tommy
bet i do
she's just a damn road hugger allison  plus the man can drive
he will be when he can't write he drinks
how about you? will you be alright?
i'll be fine are you a writer mr fink?
please barton
i know this must look funny
that son of a bitch don't get me wrong he's a fine writer
then i will respectfully take leave of her
what? he's a son of a bitch
no sometimes he just well he thinks about estelle his wife still lives in fayettesville she's disturbed
really?
he'll wander back when he's sober and apologize he always does
what what don't i understand?
hello
barton i'm sorry it's barton fink
audrey thank you for coming thank you  i'm sorry to be such a such a thank you
yes thank you how's bill?
oh he's he drifted off he'll sleep for a while now what is it you have to do exactly?
you will do as you please  it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other  do you not agree?
what are they like? what are they about?
well usually they're simply morality tales there's a good wrestler and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end in between the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect  bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type or a convict and sometimes instead of a waif he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild  the studio always hated that oh some of the scripts were so spirited
you wrote his scripts for him?
well the basic ideas were frequently his
before bill came to hollywood
what do you mean so to speak? audrey how long have you been his secretary?
barton i think we should concentrate on our little project
i want to know how many of bill's books you wrote
barton
i want to know
tommy take a walk
yes  but i am afraid of being deceived
barton honestly only the last couple
hah
and my input was mostly editorial really when he'd been drinking
that's hamburger grease bill
that doesn't help anything bill
not anything bill don't test me
drown all those rascals
who is that? gaddamn voices come into the house sons of bitches
who is this?
chet
poor man  and for that reason you want to begin where people end?
who?
chet from downstairs
garland it's me
oh yeah? what kind of write?
well as a matter of fact i write for the pictures
once or twice his name is charlie meadows
i
so you talked to mundt what about?
nothing really said he was in the insurance business
what else?
i ask only a payment on account today  after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet
he i'm trying to think nothing really he he said he liked jack oakie pictures
all right forget the heads where's mundt fink?
wp mayhew? the writer?
just bill please
all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick mebbe that's why i allus have such a powerful thrust
it's still a little early for me
so be it
well actually no bill
i don't know exactly but i do know what you're doing with that drink you're cutting yourself off from your gift and from me and audrey and from your fellow man and from everything your art is about
no son thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out no i'm usin' it to build somethin'
always my dear one never any further  love is a child to be pacified with trifles  a full diet can only kill it
what's that?
i'm buildin' a levee gulp by gulp brick by brick raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door
are you all right?
i need help audrey
i'm a writer ted okum said you're producing this wallace beery picture i'm working on
what?  ted okum doesn't know shit they've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year what ted okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl
then who should i talk to?
but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script see something by the end of the week
sure he did and he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa
who?
i know better than you do  love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away
on the beery picture where are we? wuddya got?
well not much
i'm afraid i don't really understand that genre maybe that's the prob
understand shit i though you were gonna consult another writer on this
well i've talked to bill mayhew
bill mayhew some help the guy's a souse
you don't understand he's in pain because he can't write
souse souse he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week
but i thought no one cared about this picture
you thought where'd you get that from?  you thought i don't know what the hell you said to lipnik but the sonofabitch likes you you understand that fink? he likes you he's taken an interest never make lipnik like you never
our abstinence makes our love immortal  if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more  but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires
are you deaf he likes you he's taken an interest what the hell did you say to him?
i didn't say anything
who said write? jesus jack can't read  you gotta tell it to himtell him something for chrissake
well what do i tell him?
don't panic i'll join you in a minute  what's you think of richard and poppy?
to do what?
what do you do far a living?
i'm not sure anymore i guess i try to make a difference
yes generally to see pap however point number two: a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays
i don't know garland; my place is here right now i feel i'm on the brink of success
let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew
i'd say you're already enjoying some
i'm fine garland but i have to talk with you
go ahead son
it's about what i'm writing garland it's really i think it's really big
what do you mean barton?
that's fine
have you read the bible garland?
barton is everything okay?
yes isn't it?
that's all right really thank you
my husband has convinced me of the contrary
all right hell you trying to work and me carrying on in there look the liquor's good wuddya say?
okay a quick one sure
well i'm a writer actually
you don't say that's a tough racket my hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it damned interesting work i'd imagine
doesn't surprise me at all
hell why not? everyone wants quality what kind of venue that is to say thematically uh
what do i write about?
well that's a good question strange as it may seem charlie i guess i write about people like you the average working stiff the common man
well ain't that a kick in the head
frequently played seldom remarked
sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom  he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty
well we've got something in common then
see you charlie
charlie how are you
jesus i hope i'm not interrupting you again i heard you walking around in here  figured i'd drop by
seen a doctor?
no i guess you're stuck with the one you've got have a seat
nope
i myself have yet to be lassoed
no i guess it's something about my work i get so worked up over it i don't know; i don't really have a lot of attention left over so it would be a little unfair
mine have passed on it's just the three of us now
o my dearest love  enough  i beg you  stop believing in your experience  you have never known love  my very soul is leaving me catch it on your lips and give me yours
not at all it's damned interesting
yeah
yeah okay
ready wrestle
well that's all that wrestling is except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin well it's your first time and you're out of your weight class
hi charlie
because that would mean they gave you mine
yeah as a matter of fact they did come on in
seems like nothing but lately
well my pleasure i could use a little lift myself
not all experiences are good bianca you can't always trust the people you want to
you'll be my first
let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy
a little lift yeah
well it's it's a defense mechanism
defense against what? insurance? something they need? something they should be thanking me for offering? a little peace of mind?
know about it? i can practically see how they're doin' it brother i wish i had a piece of that
where there's life there's hope
thanks brother but the fact is i gotta pull up stakes temporarily
you're leaving?
i guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper
what a dump
well
as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you  but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself  i did not know that one kiss could matter so much
well it's pathetic isn't it? i mean to a guy from new york
what do you mean?
this kind of heat it's pathetic
well i guess you pick your poison
so they say
don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye
course not compadre you'll see me again
no i'm fine thank you
no can i come in?
why don't we go to your room
we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out:  "oh my god  is it true  i am not dreaming?"
charlie i'm in trouble you've gotta help me
don't worry about it barton we can sort it
i don't know i woke up she was god you gotta believe me
yeah
what do you think happened?
they gotta believe me charlie they gotta have mercy
you're in pictures barton even if you got cleared eventually this would ruin you
she's dead barton if that was her name
have to old timer just for a while
everything's okay believe me i know it's rough mentally but everything's taken care of
roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you  was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? ever so angry but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me to your side?  did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you?  have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? no i loved you too much and too fondly; i have always loved you from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence; but i could not help loving you  i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty  what sacrifice do you want from me?  i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me
charlie i've got no one else here you're the only person i know in los angeles
well keep it for me maybe it'll bring you good luck yeah it'll help you finish your script you'll think about me
don't worry about that compadre i'll be back

i hardly knew her  she gave me the creeps though  i don't know why
yes you did  i'm a big girl  i can handle it
i don't need any help
yes you do  something's on with you  you're sleeping with her aren't you?
but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier and is famous as a man of fashion in london  it is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys but to fight an englishman is a very different matter

i thought you hardly know her
i know the type  i'm a psychologist

what did she tell me beth?
i slept with her once in school  i was just a kid  i was experimenting  it was just that one time  she developed a fixation on me  she styled her hair like mine she wore the same kind of clothes i did  it scared me
did you know noah goldstein?
i had him in two classes
you saw all the reports beth
she didn't hand you to me  she doesn't even know who you are she told me about lisa henderson
i'd draw my sword and cut my way through them
she knew you'd find out who lisa henderson is  you're a good cop  what did she do?  tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  did she tell you in bed nick? that's how i'd do it

no
everybody that i care about dies

i would've paid more  i wanted to know everything about you  then you came down here after johnny got killed it gave me a chance to get to know my character better
what about the other night what about last night?  was that to get to know your character?
maybe i'm losing interest in my book
i don't know
i'll convince you
he asked if i had an icepick in me yet
funny
honey why don't you go in the car?  i'll be right there
of course i knew
well sir this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of his majesty's closet and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy  i should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the viscounty which you propose to get
i found lisa henderson
did you?  what's she doing?
i did too  she told me it was backwards  she said you even styled your hair the way she did

really  what are you writing about
a detective  he falls for the wrong girl
what happens to them?
they fuck like minks raise rugrats and live happily ever after
it won't sell
why not?
well mr cosgrove i'll answer you point by point  the king is exceedingly averse to make peers as you know  your claim as you call them have been laid before him and his majesty's gracious reply was that you were the most impudent man in his dominions and merited a halter rather than a coronet  as for withdrawing your support from us you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please  and now as i have a great deal of occupation perhaps you will do me the favor to retire or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which i can oblige you
somebody has to die
why?
somebody always does
how did it end?
i told you  she kills him

what are you going to do?  charge me with smoking?
i had sex with him for about a year and a half  i liked having sex with him
exactly what do you have in mind mr corrigan
did you ever tie him up?
no
i'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book i'd be announcing myself as the killer  i'm not stupid
he was murdered
really  maybe that's why you're from homicide  how?
listen lady we can do this downtown if you 
read me my rights and arrest me and i'll go downtown
in so far as i can tell these things  no  i believe the chevalier won the money fairly
why would i need an attorney?
yes i am
it must really be somehtin' makin' stuff up all the time
how's that?
you make it up but it has to be believable  they call it suspension of disbelief
i like that  "suspension of disbelief"

sometimes

that's pretty cold ain't it lady?
hmmmmmm
i'm a writer  i use people for what i write  you write what you know  let the world beware

nothin'  i'll be okay pop
i got tired of being played with
you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that
what is it you got between you?
i don't know
oh i am grateful to you sir  i am the wife of captain o'reilly hastening to join him at dublin  my chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servantman fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him "good luck"
somethin' though
i don't son but i got the minority opinion
well hell son it's got a certain ring to it i'll say that
she want to play?  fine  i can play

everything  my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees
you oughta use a rubber pop  you really should
what in the hell for?  you think i'm gettin' any at my age?  i don't like bluehaired women  i don't like 'em
you don't like punk rockers?

i don't know  i'm just not
that's her pussy talkin' he gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger  he winks at her  the woman looks away from him shaking her head
maybe it wasn't her that paid him maybe the money was for somethin' else  how the fuck do i know? i'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle
in that little pissant car of yours? hell no  i ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement  i'm gettin' me a full pension and a real goldplate seiko watch
if he doesn't lower his gun i'll fucking kill her
i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap

you think i'd let you drive my cadillac car?  i ain't lettin' no hearuphisass person drive my cadillac car
she's right  you got an icepick in you yet?
i don't believe it
why not?
you're my friend gus
ain't that hard son  this young farmgirl she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers  she fixed 'em  just like 'ole hazel dobkins fixed her whole family  except young roxy here she didn't use a wedding present  she used daddy's razor
which one you talkin' about now son?  we know ole hazel did it; we know young roxy did it  and the other one well hell she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain
catherine told me what was in it
if she's telling  you the truth
but i shouldn't like to put you to such trouble mister?
don't you get it gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine  she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen
how did she know nilsen knew about it  if it happened?
he was ia  he probably asked her about it
she's a writer  it's part of what she does
goddamn writers  all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes  there's gotta be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened
i know what happened  catherine told me what happened
you got goddamn tweetybirds flutterin' around your head that's what you got  you think you're gonna fuck like minks raise rugrats and live happily ever after?  oh man
i'm going with you
she said alone  suite 405  it ain't gonna take long
she's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds
o'higgins mohawk o'higgins
maybe she did gus  maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face  let's polygraph her again and ask her about it
sometimes i think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with internal affairs
he ain't that way  he's got heart
yeah  i know
he looks a little shrunk that's all
go stick your head in a tub of ice water  see where she leads
what do you want?
when was the last time you saw john boz?
is he dead?
you're looking for catherine not me
that's very kind of you mr o'higgins
she said she didn't know herself just sort of did it on impulse  the razor just happened to be there
what was it?
do you want me to work the case phil or do you want me to 
i said keep it
formerly engaged to roberto vasquez deceased 
you forgot her degree in literature she's a writer  she published a novel last year under a pen name do you want to know what it's about?
we bring her in for questioning
she didn't ask me for the ride she asked anybody
and you volunteered
i'm sure
you must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain o'reilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver
what now what? now nothing  she passed the polygraph  that's it
she knew she could beat it  that's why she asked to take it
how the fuck do you know?  what is it with you and this broad anyway?
come on phil  you're not gonna let this slide  what about her parents?  what about what else she's published?  at least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing reallife coincidence
her parents died in an accident i don't care what else she's written  what are you  a book critic?
how did they die?  was there an investigation?
how you're saying she killed her parents?  did she kill bobby vasquez too?
fuck you too nick
what about me?
no
mr newcombe i have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed
she killed him
beth?  now you've got beth killing people?
catherine tramell  it's part of her game
first you've got her buying your file  now you've got her killing nilsen  forget her willya?  go someplace  sit in the sun  get away from this goddamn fog  get her out of your system
you don't but it do you?  she knew nobody would but it  she knew i'd say she did it  and she knew nobody would buy it
it was an accident
you're driving around north beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way 
i don't think she meant to go off the hill do you?
don't fuck with me nick  i don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling
gus and i talked to her at tramell's house  all we did was write her name down
considering your financial circumstances mr cosgrove it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you  i think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity but obviously if you would reject this offer i shall keep trying to find a better one
i told you to stay away from tramell
yeah  but you didn't tell me to stay away from her car
on what basis?
catherine tramell  age 30  no priors no convictions  double major magnum cum laude berkeley 1980  literature and psychology daughter sole survivor  marvin and elaine tramell killed in a boating accident 1978 catherine tramell sole heir  estimated assets $110 million
she was the last person seen with the guy  i'll take the responsibility
it's yours
maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook
are you vice?
you wouldn't be here otherwise would you?
i'm roxy  i'm her  friend
i am prepared to accept the terms mr newcombe
fourteen  we seal juvenile records until they're deceased  that's why you didn't find it in your computer
did you check all four years?
yes i did
can you check again?
can there be some mistake?
only if you're making it
he was shot
no should i have?
i'm a painter too
really huh too bad
there are a few other points we should discuss  the loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature and provided that bracegirdle and chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature
i don't know
when's your show?
not sure how was yours?
i haven't decided yet  rene you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow i wanna make a painting of you
i like the one with the dragon's heads a lot but the black one's filled up with too many heads  i'd take some of them out  i think you're painting too fast i wouldn't put in so many heads let it breathe a bit
it's always how you would do it this is my version
you're right it's your version you should come over to the studio sometime
why so you could humiliate me?
no i wanted to make a painting of you
let's get out of here
provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  are you serious?
see ya in an hour  so what do you think?
do you ever get sick of it?
of what?
what about the shit they write?
you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark i read that the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly that's your enemy not your audience your audience hasn't even been born yet it's a lie that art is popular the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting and andy's one of them
i haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out
as long as i've known andy he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs he's painted my picture we've eaten dinner in god knows how many places together but he doesn't care about me he cares about you you're the only person he cares about he's your friend fuck that article you want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?

yeah i really blew it i still think about her
well have you asked her to come back?
i'm going to send them to my friends for christmas presents
you think those are good presents? who wants an old wig?
mister bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life and meditated a separation in which case she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance and subject them at any rate to a doubtful and expensive litigation they were quite insistent on this point and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital
i wanted to make a few more of these frank's been drinking this mexican beer it makes a good green
how come you're not peeing on them yourself?
i don't like beer
we can do better it needed more white
gee you shouldn't take it so seriously jean that's why you can't stop taking drugs you always think people don't like you everyone likes you
people are only interested in you because you're famous not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work
when i was poor everybody doubted i could make it when i got rich everyone said `yeah but he'll never keep it up' now everyone says `he's killing himself' so i clean up and then they say `look his art's dead' i don't take drugs anyway i'm healthy now
that would be a pity because you're a real painter

when i asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth in their presence at their countinghouse in birchin lane london  i requested they come here and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to london but they declined saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to castle hackton to negotiate as they were aware of how other respectable parties such as messrs sharp and salomon had been treated here

a present i picked up for you
he's not he's out of town and he calls me every day what's weird about him?
don't you think he's using you?
why does everybody say that? he's the only person i know who doesn't need to use me
pretty much the same
forget it
george?

brooksy was better than you papa he used not to swear so and he taught me many good things while you were away

sure i'd be glad to
hang it mr roderick james you have no more manners than a barber and i think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck and i like you sir  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own
they call me steve but i prefer shenge

haitian i'm going to kill myself i'm taking pills reds blues greens
life doesn't make sense this city's kkilling me i want my liquid hijack marlboros
no i don't i'm alone we all are especially here the world's unjust the respect fools get the disrespect i get
what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you just for making this call one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world" think about it feel it
in truth sir yes but if you must marry then marry a virtuous drudge
you don't even know me i want real respect
fame my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it
can you put me in the ring with him?
i can put you in the ring with him even book the dates  but those big boys know how to fight they could make you look real sissy  i was looking at that painting upstairs it's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything  so what's your real name? 'samo?'
jean michel basquiat
fuck  i forgot about that
singing on stage and painting in your spare time
i didn't know tony bennett painted
my point exactly
yes boss  if you're so smart why are you here with me in this basement?
i ordered a czech girl  daphne you know her?
the milkmaid's daughter?
you're news i want the scoop i write it down when i speak no one believes me but when i write it down people know it's true  there's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important you know?
so what?
so shut up and keep painting
what time is it?
5:11
thanks i'll take it tonight
i can't after the show
forget it
thanks again for not inviting me i'm only here on business
a what?
well why not a milkmaid's daughter? no man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary if he selects the animal properly he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure but a comfort in his hours of annoyance  for instance i have got the gout; who tends me?  a hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power  my wife never comes near me  what friend have i?  none in the wide world  men of the world as you and i are don't make friends and we are fools for our pains
a phillips head from the toolbox
yeah
yeah
that's impossible i've got like five of 'em
i didn't know
i sculpt i'm really just starting to find myself how old are you? twenty? you're just like i used to be i'm fortyone and i'm glad i haven't gotten any recognition it gave me time to develop
pipe down lech let him order
you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you're not such a good waitress you get out too
i just don't think you're being fair
i need this?
good evening mr james have you done with my lady?
i need this?
yo you know why rammellzee's here don't you?
uhoh
i'm here for an interrogation you've been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions
you're selling and ending the culture not one bit of information only to get the money and growl with the power man
that's ignorant
no nothing ah   his parents  i  i hope he finds them
it's vichyssoise sir
vichyssoise  supposed to be cold right?
no actually i feel worse
i beg your pardon?
which is why i hoped you'd snub him
'fraid i can't  there's been a kidnapping  tell selina  ms kyle  that some business came up  no tell her some major deal fell through she'll feel sorry  no no here's what to do just tell her  let her know that i  not in a dumb "be my girlfriend way" but 
i will relay the message
alright thanks
"affair"  yes maybe  if she 
i think i'll take the stairs
i'm tempted but  well  it is an occasion for celebration and  umm  selina will probably be there 
ah  "who" may i ask are you going "as"?
you'll never guess
yes i suppose that we did
come come sir  i am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool
right  sure  and "peace on earth good will toward men"
"shreck's"  you 
i'm  sorry i 
hanging on every word
good joke  wanna hear another one?
wow a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights but explain me  if you're so down on "them" out there why bust your batbuns to protect 'em?
i just can't sleep at night exploding department stores keep me up  one 
four five
we do
but a kiss can be even deadlier if you mean it
i think sir william cosgrove you have had too much drink  your chaplin mr hunt has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter of which she is a considerable expert
i tried to grab you  save you 
seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead or deeply resentful
don't be naive  the law doesn't apply to people like him  or us 
wrong on both counts
touring the riot scene  gravely assessing the devastation upstanding mayor stuff
you're not the mayor
things change  hey good to meet you  we'll be working hand in glove in gotham's glorious future
better than you know batboy
what're you really after?
ah the direct approach  i admire that in a man with a mask  but you don't really think you'll ever win playing it your way ?
faith sir if i want to learn good principles it's surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you?
things change
maybe you're right
have we?
you mean mistook <u>me</u>?
didn't i say that?
yes and no 
no  and you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him
well that's a  long story 
well i could  free up some time
i'm listed
he wants to step into my shoes  he wants to step into my shoes
i'm tempted
i ah  didn't catch your last name
oh  "kyle"
scare me?  no actually i was just scaring myself 
i don't see how  anyway it's a treat to find you out in the world away from ebeneezer shreck
treat to be here
and it's not even accurate  i mean "batman blows it"?  the guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage
i heard on tv "catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds"  how do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
i wouldn't be caught dead  no it's probably how i would be caught  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait 
 and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight
is it not a pleasure gentlemen for me as i am drawing near the goal to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
i detest violence but  christmas complacency can be a downer too
you've got a dark side selina kyle
no darker than yours bruce
well i'm braver at night if that's what you mean
yeah?  me too
"we"?  you and
 and me  no that's be me and me  is that what i said?
yes and no
somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome i'd suppose
executive assistant  secretary  girlfriend?
i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight?
had one  didn't work
what went wrong?  hang on i think i know  you kept things from her
nope i told her everything
and the truth frightened her?
well  how can i put this there were two truths  and she had trouble reconciling them because <u>i</u> had trouble reconciling them  vicki said
"vicki"  iceskater or stewardess?
photojournalist
sure
if i said yes then you might think me a norman bates or a ted bundy type  and then you might not let me kiss you
ah  then you've come to the right lonely mansion
where is escort service?
not so soon my dear as you may fancy perhaps  why man i have been given over many times these four years and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation  who knows how long i may keep you waiting
nor i on the second
what're you doing three dates from now?
's'okay i had to go home feed my cat
no hard feelings?
y'mean take off our costumes?
guess i'm sick of wearing masks 
same here  so why'd you come tonight?
you first
jesus selina you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury i mean just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
i don't know anymore bruce 
sir let those laugh that win
but a kiss can be even deadlier if you mean  it
i don't know  till we figure it out let's  let's keep dancing
damn those carny bolsheviks the other night throwing bricks at my windows 
no  no glass on the inside
weird huh?
good time too  everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after new years'
max i'm gonna fight you on this the mayor and i have already spoken and we see eye to eye here  so 
mayors come and go  and heirs tire easily  really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with muhammed shreck
i'm not scared of you max
scared of oswald are you?  why if his parents hadn't eighty sixed him you two might've been roomies at prep school
i am sorry for you mr james  i'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting  had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  what are the odds gentlemen that i don't live to see mr james hang yet?
"oswald" is linked to the red triangle gang  i can't prove it but we both know it's true
wayne i'll not stand for mud slinging in this office  if my assistant were here she'd already have escorted you out to 
yes did  did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
course you're feeling fine  you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city
i am the light of this city  <u>and</u> i am its mean twisted soul  does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
it does to me
yawn
your blood max
my blood?  i  i gave at the office
a halfpint  i'm talking gallons
blackeyed sczortarska
sorry max  a die for a die
either you've caught a cold or you're planning to kill me
he <u>is</u> batman you moron
was
one way to find out?
down oswald  we have to talk  you see we've got something in common
appetite for destruction? contempt for the czars of fashion? wait don't tell me  naked sexual charisma?
batman  the thorn in both our sides the fly in our ointment
huh?  you're implying i'm some kinda psycho criminal?
i have but one pet cause today: ban the bat
dark valdez
oh him again  he's already history  check it out
he'd have more power as a martyr no to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most  meaning us
you're quick  mayor cobblepot
you're off the hook ozzie  but batman is decidedly <u>not</u>
well a plan <u>is</u> forming  a vicious one involving the loss of innocent life 
i want in  the thought of busting batman makes me feel all  dirty  maybe i'll give myself a bath right here 
i wouldn't touch you to scratch you
i oughta have you spayed  you sent out all the signals
did i?  only 'cause my mom trained me to with a man any man all men   corn dog
the name is oswald cobblepot
do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
dad  save yourself
she jumped  she'd been depressed
yes  <u>yes</u>  boyfriend trouble ?
pms
women nothing surprises me chip excepting your late mother who even knew selina had a brain to damage?  bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us we drop her out a higher window  meanwhile i got badder fish to fry  yeah  oswald please
the christmas eve of destruction  
 eight seven
silent night violent night
all is shrill all is blight
but who could've  no don't say it
yes  he brought me in his carriage and he will call for me at midnight
my lips are sealed
my god  it's true  the penguin man of the sewers  please don't h
quiet max  what do you think this is a conversation?
no just give you a splitting headache
well it's not working
and exactly <u>why</u> am <u>i</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
what about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in gotham?
if there were such documents  and that is not an admission  i would have seen to it they were shredded
fred  fred?  he's  actually he's been on an extended vacation and 
you won't regret this mr shreck
and he doesn't care about me?
a big bag of fan mail?  filthy lucre?  wait don't tell me  is it a broad?
yes adulation is a cross to bear god knows <u>i</u> know  but someone's got to supplant our standingin thewayofprogress mayor and don't deny it mr cobblepot you've got the magic
max elections happen in november is this not late december or have i inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
we need signatures  to overturn the ballot  i can supply those oswald
i could teach her my "french flipper" trick
oswald:  we need one more thing
a platform?  lemme see  stop global warming  start global cooling  make the world a colder place  <u>frigid</u> 
that's fine oswald  but to get the mayor recalled we still need a catalyst a trigger an incident like the reichstag fire the gulf of tonkin
"you're doin' great mayor cobblepot"  "your table is ready mayor cobblepot"  "i need you oswald  i need you now  that's the biggest parasol i ever "
 want 'em to go apeshit  nutso ballistic  do permanent damage to little old ladies  loot pillage annoy people in a big way   <u>sounds</u> fun  but i 
he is only curious to know who you are
sidetracked?  oswald this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded 
reclaim my birthright y'mean?
imagine:  you'll have the ear of the media  access to captains of industry  unlimited poon tang 
point is listen to them  they've lost faith in old symbols they're ready to bond with you the icon of the future  if it works don't fix it
i think you'd feel out of place at my party  you see it's for winners
not chip  please  penguin  if you have one iota of human feeling you'll take me instead
i don't  so no
i'm the one you want  penguin please  ask yourself:  isn't it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  isn't it max not chip whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
okay you have a point  plus the hysterics are getting on my nerves
no i am  yes i'm boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning  i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant and mr wayne's hopedfor investment i've studied up on all of it  i even opened the protected files and 
if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here
well i figured that your password was "finster"  your pomeranian and it was  and it's all very interesting though a bit on the technical side i mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant
and who  would you say this <u>to</u>?
i'm no cat  i'm just an assistant a <u>secretary</u> 
and a very very good one
too good?
i must protect my interests ms kyle  and interest number one is <u>moi</u>
actually it's a lot like that
that's my name maximillions don't wear it out babe or i'll make you buy me a new one
uh selina this is uh bruce wayne
i damn well better be  in fact i want you to phone those goniffs over at gotham insurance and tell them 
that's confidential  could you put the money on the dresser?
he loves me as i love you
actually i have to split  take a "personal day"  you don't mind? max you're tops
ten years  barbara isn't really me niece sir she's joanna clark's daughter
uncle alfred left for america  much to my mother's dismay 
eventually she married a young physician
oh no those things frighten me
you came to tuck me in  that's quite a switch  i am looking for my brother wilfred he is first butler to the maharajah of mirajanpore  but mirajanpore is a floating court it travels across india so wilfred can be rather difficult to find
i have been trying to reach wilfred with no success  as one grows older one yearns for family
it's good to see you again uncle i've missed you
as i've missed you  sleep well child
too late for what dear child?
will he wish to know the details of this night?
i came to give you your freedom a chance to live the life you choose the same gift you gave me
i have been part of the greatest adventure ever know  i have found purpose here and the family i could never have
what is it?
it is the hearts of two good men whom i have had the honor of calling son  take it child  but i implore you never open it  you look so like your mother
in spirit only i'm afraid
the boys need help
perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone
don't tell me you're on his side again
despite all your talents you are still a novice in the ways of family dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course  you must learn to trust him  for that is the nature of family
no apology necessary  that's the first time in thirty years
he will believe that it will please me if he asks about it and i shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him
secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house don't you think?
there's a lovely inn just down 
don't be silly alfred after all she's family
thanks
alfred am i pigheaded?  is it always my way or the highway?
why yes actually  death and chance stole your parents  but rather than become a victim you have done everything in your power to control the fates  for what is batman if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world an attempt to control death itself
no my boy  i'm afraid none of us can
alfred i know you're sick  i can get you the best doctors
i've seen the best doctors a gentleman does not discuss his health  it's not civilized  i hope i've taught you at least that much young man
attending to heroes?  no sir  my only regret is that i was never able to be out there with you
tender hegenheim
not all heroes wear masks
yes?
everyone dies master bruce  there's no defeat in that  victory comes in fighting for what we know is right while we still live
remember this  and remember it always  i'm proud of you  and i love you too son
right here sir
what seems to be the problem?
women
that sir does not compute
first ivy had an intoxicating effect on both dick and me  tonight my feelings spread to someone else
specify please
you know that was like a quadruple negative?
pamela isley  i was so attracted to her i couldn't reason clearly  i still can't  she used to work for wayne enterprises  find a file
coming on line now sir
pheromones?
glandular secretions from animals scents that create powerful emotions  fear  rage
passion  of course  find the photo of ivy after the flower ball
it appears sir that someone has stolen the batsignal
rather disappointed at how poorly i taught you proper housekeeping  and quite well it seems  thanks to you son  thanks to you all
oxbridge academy?
their new computer sciences division  how did you know?
i recognized the accent
it's ten thirty in the morning
hey i'm the one who kicked ivy's botanical butt  personally  me  i did
you are going back to school
i'm so sorry to trouble you but
my parents were killed in an auto accident ten years ago  alfred has been supporting me ever since
whatever you say lady  it's all in a day's work for me
keep it
of course dick grayson ward of the fabulously wealthy bruce wayne why would you need a few hundred dollars?
hey what's your problem?
i guess the truth is i'm just not comfortable with the idle rich  even when they try to act like heroes
you'd be surprised
yeah if you've slept
street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at oxbridge  they kicked me out  it doesn't matter i've won enough money to do what i've always dreamed
just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus
what are you talking about?
servants masters it's  ridiculous alfred is the sweetest most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else
alfred and bruce are like family
paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes you call that family?
alfred's happy here
happy  you honestly don't know do you? you can't even see what's in front of your own eyes
divide and conquer
batgirl baatgirl baatgirl
you know the law  no liquor before noon could lose my license
crimefighter's rule number one: never say that
why?
i'm afraid to ask
be ready for anything
what exactly are you doing?
i don't know  it just feels right
damn?  damn is not good
those targeting mirrors are frozen the sun beam won't work
i hate being lectured
freeze you're mad  this capsule will slaughter thousands
don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"?
we have eleven minutes to stop freeze and thaw the city
i think not  there'll be no hot time in this old town tonight  you'll get a charge out of this
i didn't kill your wife
nightwing  scourge of darkest evil
this is all about fashion for you isn't it?
it's the gear  chicks love the gear
mr freeze
the batcomputer tracks him heading for the gotham museum
the new antiquities exhibit  the second sun of the sudan
of course  he's going to steal the giant white diamond
yeah and i could've used the sleep i'm supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going
no robin  he's going to jail
i thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs
how about nice to see you?  glad you're here to save my life
surf's up
he'll be here
i'll borrow it from you  four million  
i can make it
i know  the feeling just vanished
i can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy
bad yes  guy no  this is one majorly beautiful evil person
i guess i'll never know will i?
i like to talk to the person who runs the service  can you give me address?
who?
i'm totally over her  positively
me too  great stems though
ummhmmmm
definitely
open sesamechicken
can he save her?
no  her case is too advanced  but maybe someday with more research
just the beast
what are you talking about?
why is she so desperate to kiss us? i'm betting her lips are poison
old friend haven't talked to him in  911 can i use your phone?
a poison kiss?  you have some real issues with women you know that?  you just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me  couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours  could you?
she knows who we are
i guess we'll just have to kill her
kill her later  we've got work to do
maybe he melted
from the other side of the equator
don't make me kill you in front of the girl
dr pamela isley
what can i do for you doctor?  a research grant?  a hospital wing?
actually i already work for you or did  your arboreal preservation project in south america
i'm  i'm sorry
we cut our support  a conflict of ideologies  dr woodrue was a lunatic
i see you knew him
that lab was consumed by fire last week  how did you manage to escape?
i have here a proposal showing how wayne enterprises can immediately cease all actions that toxify our environment
your intentions are noble but no diesel fuel for heat  no coolants to preserve food  millions would die of cold and hunger alone
acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet
people come first dr isley
although the wayne foundation is hosting the event sadly i will be unable to attend  thank you all  good day doctor
i can't  but perhaps tonight over dinneri've just had an opening
maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but i am not the least bit titillated by your attentions  so back off or i'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment  got me?
i thought i was gonna have an attack go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou childs could tell i wasn't right
umm  what i mean isno plans at the moment
but soon
can i get some help over here?
what?  i'm sorry  you were saying
we've been going out over a year now andokay here goes  bruce i want to spend my life with you
i know you're a dedicated bachelor that you've had a your wild nights
wild doesn't exactly cover it
but there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness i couldn't learn to understand
i wouldn't bet on that
i'm betting on you  you'll make someone a good husband one day but i can't wait around forever don't answer now  just think it over  here's some food for thought
just safety your shit and get behind me okay? i'll take care of this
what?
you just called me ivy  who's ivy?
i wish i knew
bruce?  what are you doing?
wellumher
you were right  i get it  you're not the marrying kind  you've made your point  goodbye bruce wayne
somehow he survived  but the cryoslution mutated his body
presumed dead  no one knows
let me get this straight a brilliant citizen disfigured by a horrible accident reemerges as a psychotic supervillain bent on theft revenge and destruction you see a pattern here?
<		maybe it's something in the water
what do we do?
we gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
absolutely  just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator
whoa i made a mistake  i'm sorry don't go all protective on me  it won't happen again
dick you were reckless  you could have been killed
i'm fine  see  me  here  alive how are we gonna work together if you're never going to trust me?
you left your back wide open  freeze could have killed you
anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who joanna clark is?
but he's never said a word
you know alfred  he'd never say anything  but i can tell  until you came along alfred was the only family i ever had  without him i don't know how i would have survived  he saved my life dick  and i've never told him
talk to him bruce  there's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel
whoever it is isn't shooting at us
i'm scared dick  maybe for the first time in my life  i'm really scared
yes  but alfred's condition is less severe  freeze's research says he cured a case like alfred's  it just doesn't say how
i checked the medical database  no one else is even close
i'm late for the dedication  then i go after freeze and ivy  alone
like hell you do
dick don't push me right now
or what?  no one can capture ivy but the big bad bat  crap  you just want her for yourself  don't you?  answer me damn it
yes  yes i want her so badly i can taste it  that's the whole point look at us  orphans  isolated obsessed to the exclusion of life love family  we're perfect targets she's done something to us got us fighting over her somehow
hail the allknowing bruce wayne here's what i know she loves me not you and it's driving you crazy it's why you stopped us from kissing because if you can't have her nobody can
she's clouded your mind  you're not thinking straight
fine
oh but i am  for the first time in a long time  i'm through living in your shadow  all that ends right now
her name is pamela isley  i saw her talking to gordon  she must have stolen his keys altered the signal
and she did it all for me  for love
she's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract
is that it bruce?  i'm under some magic spell?
she wants to kill you
you'd say anything to keep me away from her  to keep her for yourself
you once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner  that sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win  do you remember?
i knew you could handle it
listen captain cold the suit maybe even though silver went out in the 70's  but those boots are unforgivable what is it with men?
it was the grenade you fucking idiot look at him
i'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but i'm kind of pressed for time  so hand over the diamond garden gal or i turn you into mulch
well i my most unabominable snowman have been impressed by you in fact i propose a pairing  so i'm here to set you free
an enticing offer  but what does the lady want in return?
let's cool it for now  there's someone i want you to meet
i always go a size smaller  makes me look slimmer
i wonder if i can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
dear daisy don't despair
you are looking unseasonably hot let's go inside and grab your rocks
you leave batman and robin to me
fine  while i retrieve my diamonds you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair  she's frozen in 
maybe he'll be there either way we have to go
hold it  you never said anything about a wife frozen or otherwise
ok ok  ms ivy to the rescue  now where do i find your brittle bride?
where is my wife?
there was nothing i could do  batman deactivated her  she's dead
you lie
kill them  of course  but why stop there?  why should only batman and robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
just what i had in mind  everything dead on earth except us  a chance for mother nature to start again  plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man  sorry hon this is for science  behold the dawn of a new age
adam and evil
can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
that is far too merciful  batman will watch his beloved gotham perish then i will kill him
look  do we have a problem here? there's no reason to have a problem i'm gonna make you feel real good  you wanna czech girl? after i'm done with you you won't miss her  now why don't you pay me?
maybe he's dead too maybe you killed them both mueller 
as a team the duncely duo protect each other  but the robin is young impetuous  if i could get him alone
one kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face  their secret identities would be revealed  but how best to bait a brid?
the way to a boy's heart is through his ego  what strapping young hero could resist his very ownsignal?
inspired ms ivy
i'm hungry  i think i'll have poultry
not good
i find that unlikely
okay my hair is brittle my skin is dry and i don't care  i'd weather blizzards to have you you're the most perfect man i've ever known
to be frozen  to never change  a life of perpetual iceolation there is little perfection in that
what say we turn up the heat?
none of that matters now we got two dead bodies and a story that explains them you're either with us or against us  which is it?
you're skating on thin ice  my passion thaws for my bride alone
forget your frosty femme  these lips are wet and ready to get frostbite
hop away little bunny  before i cool your jets  permanently
at you?  polly want a kiss?
i want us to be together  but i need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf  i need a sign
how about dangerous curves?
of trust tell me your plan
kiss me and i'll tell you
tell me and i'll kiss you
freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun  he's about to turn gotham into an ice cube
can anybody hear me
i've got to stop him
one kiss my love  for luck
what do you mean?
you should have heeded your pointy eared pal  these lips can be murder
then you never loved me?
love you?  i loathe your bipedal arrogance your animal superiority my only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your apelike face
sorry to disappoint you  but rubber lips are immune to your charms
what exactly are you working on in there?  what are those screams?
you must show me your secrets blossom before i show you mine
our work?
we found him like this 
without your research i could never have come this far  join me  the two of us entwined side by side
well i can respect your opinion
hello jason  i think i've had a change of heart
i think they're getting worse
it's a wonder you sleep at all
then you'd have nothing to complain about
hardly a worry sir
a few hitches sir but i'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time
it'll never work
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile
we found him like this kendall was with me the whole  listen to me
she has an excellent mind
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady i humbly apologize
i wonder if she'd go out with me
apology hastily retracted
your parents' wake rain fell like tears
the night batman was born  what was i doing in the fields that night alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can't remember
i don't know sir your dear parents  suddenly gone so much loss
i remember the bat though his scream those eyes i was sure the fear would kill me  in time i came to believe that if i became a monster that if i was feared i wouldn't be scared anymore i was wrong  they think i became batman to fight crime i became batman to fight the fear and instead i became the fear
ninetythree including the sauna
take any three you like after you get settled we can
before or after the explosion?  mueller 
what did you say?
he killed them twoface he slaughtered that boy's parents
no you said i i killed them
don't be ridiculous
is he all right?
i'm afraid master dick has gone traveling
he ran away?
actually he took the car
he boosted the jag?  is that all?
not the jaguar the _other_ car
i don't know
the _rolls_?
_no_ sir _the_ _other_ _car_
i shall be near at hand should you need me and sir i know it's difficult but try and have a good time
which `they' might that be sir?
jack napier's dead my parents are avenged the wayne foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs
why indeed?
could i let batman go? for dick for me could i leave the shadows? have a life friends family
dr meridian
perhaps perhaps not why not ask the lady?
how? as batman knowing she wants me? or as bruce wayne and hope?
hey
not that young it's been a long time since you've called me that
old habits die hard are you alright?
as well as can be expected i guess give me the bad news
dick has run away they have taken dr meridian and i'm afraid they found the cave sir it's been destroyed
perhaps the fall
there's one other thing i feel
what?
afraid
bruce son listen to me you are a kind man a strong man but in truth you are not the most sane man
a bat
shut up mueller
what?
i remember a bat a monster a demon chasing me  oh my god alfred
no demons son  your monsters are here until you fact that i fear you will spend your life fleeing them
batman alfred i'm batman
but 1 3 1 8 & 5 what do they mean?
what do maniacs always want?
recognition of course
precisely so this number is probably some kind of calling card
of course 13 is mmre
how about mr e
we don't know west is dead
mystery
and another name for mystery?
enigma
exactly mr e mister edward nygma
claw island nygma's headquarters i'm sure that's where they're keeping chase  are all the batsuits destroyed?
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of but it hasn't yet been tested
tonight's a good night
how ya doin' al?
al?
big house how many rooms?
look man i don't give a shit if you want sex or not but you're payin' for my time
what do you mean alone?
how come this is the only locked door around this museum? what's back there?
master wayne's dead wives
just checking young sir
four seconds from
and you are?
i'm flattered not every girl makes a superhero's night table  you might have some interesting insights into twoface
why's that?
let's just say i could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent
bats aren't rodents dr meridian
i didn't know that see? you _are_ interesting and call me chase by the way do you have a first name? or do i just call you bats?
we found him like this
what's wrong?
last night at the circus i noticed something about dent his coin he's obsessed with justice it's his achilles' heel it can be exploited
are you trying to get under my cape doctor?
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone
it's the car right? chicks love the car
what is it about the wrong kind of man? in grade school it was guys with earrings college motorcycles and leather jackets
try a fireman less to take off
i don't mind the work pity i can't see behind the mask
my life's an open book you read?
i'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic
shut up  west's dead
we could give it a try i'll bring the wine you bring the scarred psyche
you are direct aren't you?
you like strong women i've done my homework or do i need skintight vinyl and a whip?
maybe you just haven't met the right woman
did twoface call him bruce?
no more tricks edward release chase and dick this is between you and me
excellent see who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? well it's been grand sorry you all have to die now
for _me_? really? tell me
i see without seeing to me darkness is as clear as daylight what am i?
oh please you're blind as a bat
we can still come out of this okay pike got free he got a gun he came after us that's the story
exactly
bruce wayne in the flesh
umi'm pretty sure i'm bruce wayne and you are?
nygma edward nygma you hired me personally just like i tell everyone  well we've never actually met but your name was on the hire slip
what? ah yes of course i'm sorry it's just thatyou're my idol  and some people have been trying to keep us apart
mr nygma you'll forgive me for being rude but what exactly is on your mind?
precisely what's on all our minds? brainwaves the future of wayne enterprises is brainwaves
wait you can't go
we'll talk some other 
no don't leave me my invention i need you
i asked for a policeman
what? oh edward hi congratulations great party
the press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold outclassed and generally outdone in every way  and what light through yonder window breaks? `tis the east and you are
gracious even in defeat how vaguely disappointing when all this could have been ours together
nostrovia
la'chiem
slanta
rinka
banzai

on occasion usually at night
she's a malaysian dream warden she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams  need one?
me? no only things that need calming in my dreams are the rockettes
wacko? that a technical term?
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles work better for you?
so what you're saying this guy's a total wacko right?
exactly
so this riddler he's dangerous?
it's too slow
what do you know about obsession?
not much
the letter writer is obsessed with you his only escape may be
to kill me
you understand obsession better than you let on
no insights here doc just trying to get comfortable on your couch  oops times up
that's usually my line
look i'd love to keep chatting
would you? i'm not so sure
but i'm going to have to get you out of those clothes
well it's a game of anticipation that's the beauty
excuse me
and into a black dress
i'm sorry who are you?
what? this isn't normal?
i don't get you bruce wayne
me? i'm easy especially after a couple of martinis
the glib cavalier routine it really is an act isn't it?
don't believe it i'm just skin deep
bruce much to my surprise you seem like a really great guy
but
i just don't like it
well i met someone
fast work you just moved here
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang i think he felt it too
he sure did
what?
i said i'm sure he did
sorry i haven't even had time to unpack instant coffee okay?
and now
they've changed the dreams i mean there's a new element i don't understand a book black covered in leather
why do i feel like the other man here?
what do you like then?
come on bruce this is what i do for a living
i'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home
what do you want me to say? that i'm not attracted to him?
what?
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask if you're jealous
i'm not
you want me close but you won't let me near what's the terrible dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
rage anger passion pain
keep me off the couch doc your fees are a little rich for me
touchy touchy
alright alright  don't hurt me please it's in my book in my purse
c'mon ray everyone hates the army during basic i'll tell you straight i hated it here
so how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of batman?
oh god bruce you're still jealous
spare me the diagnosis okay? you're being ridiculous i can't be jealous of batman  can i?
excuse me boys i'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account
okay tiger take it slow you going to give me your pin or something?
i don't want to remember
stop fighting
what does it say? what hurts so much bruce? what does the book say?
i don't
you do know try
you did basic here?
oh god bruce you were a child you weren't responsible
not the bat?
what?
i always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life but it wasn't the real fear was hiding underneath: what i read in the journal that my parents' deaths were my fault that's what i couldn't remember that's the crime i've been paying for all these years
what are you talking about?
chase there's something i need to tell you
excuse me
i figure telling that cop i'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will so no offense but thanks see ya
i got no place at the circus without my family i'm going to get a fix on twoface then i'm going to kill him
listen dick killing twoface won't take the pain away it'll make it worse
fifteen years ago under sergeant west piece of work that guy i remember he used to have these two silver 45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough he'd knock you on the head with one of them he still carry those guns?
look spare me the sermons okay you're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed you don't even know me
absolutely not
me and my brother chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire dad's knee was going chris was engaged you know that? twoface tookeverything now i can pay him back
what i do isn't about revenge
you don't understand it's an addiction you fight night after night trying to fill the emptiness but the pain's back in the morning and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice  i want better for you
save the sermons about how great you want my life to be okay bruce? if it weren't for batman my parents wouldn't be dead you don't get it do you? this is all your fault
you have a real gratitude problem you know that bruce? i need a name batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
how about richard grayson college student?
i missed twoface by a heartbeat when we catch him you gotta let me kill him
we don't kill killing is what damns you it what am i talking about? this conversation is over you're going away to school
they're dead aren't they?
i saved your life you owe me so either you let me be your partner or i'm going after harvey on my own
dick let go revenge will eat you alive trust me i know
but what about all the good we can do? there are monsters out there gotham needs us
and when you finally get twoface?
bruce you can't
chase is coming for dinner why don't you join us
of course you are and what a grand pursuit you must be  what do you think of my new invention?
who is it?
it's dr meridian chase do you remember me?
how could i forget?
okay
dr burton tells me you know who batman is
yesssssss i know
can't tell if you don't say please
you're right edward i didn't mean to be impolite please

never heard of a doublecross?
okay but i would like to know about the other cadets what they were like  nice guys?
you _are_ twoface you would need to face both rivers both uptown and downtown simultaneously only one spot in gotham serves these bi zonal bicoastal needs
congratulations you get to die on the dean's list
a man with a death wish
harvey you need me since you've gotten out of arkham you've managed what? to bungle stealing a safe? wreck a statue? and correct me if i'm wrong here but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
let's see if you bleed green
so not everyone can be a poet still i respect the sentiment
addictive isn't it? just say no until i say yes a little fringe benefit of working with me now here's the concept counselor crime my iq your ak47 you help me gather production capital so i can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse bruce wayne's forever and in return i will help you solve the greatest riddle of all who is batman?
here get a good seat
haven't you had enough? don't think and drive
don't bogart that 'trode
tell me about them
about what?
everything
kill me? well alright go ahead take the empire all yours  hell harv old pals i'll kill me for you
you're a genius
oh yes and certainly _we_ will
miss
a miss and my favorite vitamin i might add
you sunk my battleship
i'd say about thirty feet sir
you know if you cut your bathroom in half you'd have my apartment
yeah and that's all i'm saying
which bathroom is that sir?
the small one
alexander knox gotham globe
mr wayne is out for the day
actually i wanted to talk to batman pass that on to mr wayne would you?
thank you alfred  i hope you'll excuse me  it was a great pleasure meeting you  and you
 very good sir
upstairs he's quite docile
i know the feeling it won't last  he's a long way ahead of where i was at his age
respectfully sir there'll never be another one like you
this is one of those interrogation tricks isn't it? you don't give me a cigarette till i tell you more
don't ever say that sir don't ever believe it
if not for you i never would've made it you know that my own parents couldn't have   the boy alfred you'll both be provided for don't let all this got to waste
take me let the boy go
gosh i could kill you but then you'd miss my party and you batman  you're the guest of honor
what are you talking about?
batman don't you even recognize your old pal jack? after all   you made me what i am today
 murderer
bruce we're both murderers think how many people you've killed by letting me live
which car?
i know i called them
yes sir
no actually i just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some
shouldn't we 
he won't kill her  goddammit
too many people come on  shields
 a hundred and eight?
well  i think you might consider
i just wanted to distract them i wasn't trying to get a picture of you
i won't let you have it
look i appreciate what you did for me but this is my job and i'm keeping those pictures
all right i'll develop the photos anything i don't want is yours
how do i know you won't keep them all?
that son of a bitch
i'll take you with me
 where are you taking me?
quite a while i took the scenic route
well i've certainly enjoyed it  what's that?
better it's not on the market yet
it doesn't protect your head though
that's why i wear a target on my chest
exploring in the woods many years ago  i was a solitary child
i loathe bats
so did i once but i kept coming back and i guess i became the thing i feared most
that'd be my reaction too 
photo database i'll do your photos now
that can't be right that would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned we'd all be dead
no every product contains one component the elements react in combination hair spray won't do it but hair spray and perfume and lipstick will  untraceable it's very elegant
i don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me
if you don't mind my asking who's close to you?
you could've killed him you know you could've killed the joker
i had to save you vicki i    please trust me
bruce wayne   i've read your work  i quite like it
great  give me a grant
i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale
he's lying
you're just back from corto maltese  i saw your combat photos  quite a departure for you
what is it you want?
i want you to hang up the suit and i want you to stay away from vicki
i can't do that not while the joker's still at large
then stay away from vicki that's all i want man i just want your word
tell me knox if you've got the story why haven't you printed it?
because i   because she'd never speak to me again
yeah a drink 'civilized' right?
alfred bring something for mr knox  i'll have one too
as far as i know
well why didn't you say so? we'll just drop all your charges then 
good  with any luck we'll run into each other
too much work  i'm not really the physical type  thank you alfred
that's a tough one  have you ever seen combat?
no
neither had i  odd desire for a woman i guess
odd desire for anyone
well  a couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid i went down there for newsweek the beaches were nice  and at nights  they had a band  i danced on the hotel patio  of course i never saw what was really happening there when the war broke out i had to go back and i promised myself that this time i wouldn't look away
what did you see?
 terror
well bruce some types are a little more obvious than others
i'm serious 
in other words what right do i have to talk about terror
as much as i do  it's not that  i don't want to be depressing that's all
i see  if i know how you really feel i won't like you as much
vicki if i say anything cryptic or ambiguous i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it  because even if it doesn't sound that way that's how i'll mean it
i'll take you home if you'd like
god  you would  come on bruce  i just want to get two drinks in you  as an experiment
maybe we should just kiss
 we could try that
then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well and i know what it is  now you'll have to kill me
i said i'd call you the minute i got free  and i did  and here we are
did kendall tell you about the px?
mmhmm  lunch  not even dinner
 looks like a convention
yes bruce  i'm here 
i'm sorry i had to stand you up today i'd like to make it up to you
well bruce  i don't think  that would be possible
i realize the way things have gone between us   i wish you'd reconsider
i wish you'd
 i know it's you bruce i'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it
who's this 'bruce'? are you trying to make me jealous?
i'm serious bruce we have to  
i didn't shoot west 
no one would miss me
i don't understand it you can do so much good for people as bruce wayne
you're one man you can't save everybody
what if i could save a handful?  what if i could save one?
sometimes i don't know if there's enough of me left to save
very thoughtful don't touch it
i feel naked without it
the does it it's going to be this weekend
 where are you calling from?
finding out where she is
yeah we know pike did
how can you do that if she's already off the line?
i've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum
what now?
hang on i have to leave a message
i'm frightened of you bruce i'm frightened for you
in all these years why couldn't i see how it wold turn out?
ohhhh you don't mean that
i don't but i do it's just i love you bruce i don't want you to
vicki do you love half of me? or all of me?
he'll be ready when you do remember what happened at the apartment
you saw west's body
all right bruce what do you suggest?
i suggest a nice big bomb
good a bomb on a blind tip from bruce wayne  we do have laws
then for god's sake harvey cancel the anniversary celebration
we've told him we'll deal what could he possible have to gain by 
do you still think the joker cares about money??
i don't know i'm just a da i don't have access to all you expert sources
take 'em i want his head
what?
somebody's killed the 
two weeks holiday
of course 
what??
they'll be sorry they'll be sorry move out
it's a detour they're backed up for blocks
sorry  we had another bat sighting
don't let your job interfere with your business   someone's been talking to harvey dent
eckhardt our problems are your problems
why eckhardt  you should be thinking about the future
what are you talking about?
about how pretty you are pretty boy  maybe he'd like to know 
what are you scared of heights?
yeah 
i dunno man  after what happened to johnny gobs  
look johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof all right?  no big loss
that ain't what i heard  that ain't what i heard at all  i heard the bat got him
gimme a break will you?  shut up
five stories straight down there was no blood in the body
no shit  it was all over the pavement
god  how old are you?  there ain't no bat
no wonder you're such a chickenshit  now shut up  there ain't no bat
do you want this money or don't you?  now shut up  shut up 
very good idea jack  in fact    i'd like you to handle this operation personally
they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession i'll write a confession
because i want someone i can trust
oh jack   don't forget your lucky deck
jack?  thank god  i can't believe it's you  i heard you'd been 
is that what you "heard"?
i've died once already  it wasn't so bad  in fact i recommend it
jack?  jack?  do i look like a jack?
ha  that's the best part i can't
i've considered that possibility
and what happens if we say no?
nobody wants a war carmine  if we can't do business we shake hands and part friends
you saved kendall's life 
that's it?
that's it
i'd like to read a prepared statement 'while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace'
huh demands well gents this is kinda embarrassing but i'm having such a swell time i just haven't thought any up
ten million dollars ten mi  you cheapskates i've just wiped out the stock market i've cost you billions  i want ten million and one
please we'll talk just tell us what you expect
goddammit i expect to be treated like and artist get off my screen
unfortunate but i think we can work around it
a visual record yes  a beforeand after kind of thing  this could make your reputation
 behind the makeup?
but not pike's
strong stomach huh?  i like that in a woman  maybe we can do business after all
alicia  come here have a seat  show miss vale why you wear the mask
what?  i improved her a little
miss vale was it something i said?  do you want to sniff my flower?
honey   i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale  if i had a good enough hint
too much glamor huh  what's in the bag   monte carlo?  apes in kenya?
a girl could get killed   so they tell me  what's new and hot in gotham city?
oh it's too good  we got a sixfoot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers
evildoers huh?  big or small?
small so far  i think he's leaving the big fish for harvey dent
mr hardy i joined the army for college money i didn't ask for any of this  i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed you say finding those bodies'll help me then go find them i don't want to die
our next da  i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser  did you get your invitation yet?
oh absolutely  bruce and i are very close
well i'm starving  will you at least buy me a hamburger?
some  i am a rich bitch remember?  i'm quoting
all aver the world  they say he's spent half of his life overseas
holy shit
likes to kill? knox  women find him magnetic
i bet they like him for his big charity balls
that and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks
well you know me  the more they've got the less they're worth  this guy must be the most worthless man in america
you wanna bet?

something like this  what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
yeah?  according to this he's in geneva from '76 to '79 well i called geneva  nobody there's even heard of the guy   probably off in tibet with some kung fu master
oh you don't? what else do you have on me? you haven't found any bodies yet have you?
are they paying you for all this?
everybody needs a hobby  you explain it vicki  he walks out on his own party  half an hour later who turns up?  batman  sees an execution freaks out in an alleyway  no place to change
allie i know exactly why you're doing this
 oh?  why is that vicki?
 okay then i have a confession to make  i'm the batman
right  and they know him  and that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for 
i've had it with you  i'm leaving
bruce wayne is out of his mind  next time you call him up and he can't go out friday night   think it over

yeeees?
and they asked me if we'd like to  you know put him up for a while
there aren't hotels?
yes there are hotels  they just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real american family  popcorn waffles all that stuff
and what did you say?
i said i'd check with you
ahm  he's male  he's english  he's a doctor of er  at least 2 things  i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf  or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time  i think we're looking at someone moderately normal here
how much money are you carrying with you?
do what?
david  are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
yes  yes  sometime
that's exactly what i said  before i said  great it's a sensational idea"
tom jones?
did you really ask?
i'm not sure i got the right person but they were a bit busy 
what's wrong with you david?  all you have to do is say excuse me i've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i'd really like some action from you before the end of the world i'll go
i know  i'11 take it in to george tomorrow' he'll fix it  stupid thing
i need some time david  a little time  it's not just you  it's partly me
i had the last strawberry in the refrigerator
hunting  we had to hunt him 
one
0h ali we can work this thing out you know
your face smells like a foot
it's okay  there's no one out here just open the door  trust me
david i'm serious
i know you are  very serious  most of the time these days
now what does that mean?  my daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed and i'm supposed to think it's amusing?  that tie's godawful  why do you wear it?
hi  roses
yes  and	i have a wine for dinner that will kill you
great  you said you'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else  did you?
and the bodies?
sort of half
meaning?
i was sort of half way through the sentence in which i would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake
honestly david you're so spineless
ah well  cut to:
sorry honey  he just happened to tag along
nothing ever really changes does it david?
yes  great  kevin i'11 send bean in to keep you company
about charles
it was nothing  we're not  he just makes me laugh  when was the last time we laughed?  any of us?
you won't find them won't find west either he's too good
i know i know i've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions olympic standard
good idea  with a boss who's a really ugly sonofabitch
no i'm fine
i'm afraid you don't know the half of it sit down  i have a tale to tell  and not a happy one
annie it's me
oh right yeah  two dollars please
no annie no  this is doctor bean he's going to be working with us
right first time
i can understand that neither do i
thanks annie
washout rejects guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"
night
uh  yes 
great  classic timing  why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  i'll check my diary later
excuse me
yes  ahm think i'11 
ahm
what?  what?
oh dear
what happened?
ahm 
he's telling the truth up to a point
whistler was a great painter but he wasn't a great chooser of paints 
well ahm
but the particular glory of the system is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room  so we can network the program to every room in the gallery
yes  i'11 mention it to him  but  he's kind of his own guy you know?
howls he getting on with the family?
ah fine  it's good  it's great
she's  well she's good
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers  nice guy  good looking
yes isn't he
it's great when people who work together can become real friends
no ma'am he just wanted us to quit making it through was kind of an honor some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight command would consider you at the top of the class
isn't it?
thanks david  always a pleasure
not necessarily  that's where this   comes in  no i've had a better idea than sacking people  you'll hear soon enough
yes look i wanted to talk to you about this  i'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that
you're an innocent and an optimist david  that's why i love you   jesus  what a terrible tie come on the governor's coming at 3 and before then i have a little surprise for you and the boss
yes  ahm  i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to
he's just parking the governor's car
great  keep him out of trouble
i don't think you really understand what you're looking at 
great news
tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out
love to sir but no can do  no spare room  period
david?
well bravo  what with you and whistler's ma  i think i've got a winning team
and that's where you introduce me to the governor
right  got it
hey  let's junk the medals elmer  this is not a veterans' reunion we wanna make the governor feel at home  not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms
thank you bernie  well done  now if you'll excuse  i have a little smartening up to do myself
thank you sir  although i'm afraid i don't quite see how we can 
good point bernie  precisely the kind of perceptive interjection i'd expect from my new vp how can we you ask survive without whistler's mother  our single greatest asset?  well the truth is  we can't  so what am i saying?  will we find her again?  never  this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius
i beg your pardon?
there were six of us
i said say that again son  because the next time you do i'll make sure you're in there with my daughter but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now
i'm er  sorry if you've been waiting a long time
we have  in fact we've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i'd really like some action from you before the end of the world
okay sir  certainly  good
i thought perhaps as vicepresident and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year the massive financial loss 
on the other hand  maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs  yes  great news  fabulous  triumphant  course it might need a little smoothing over  when's he due?
no perfect  looking forward to it cut to:
yes this is doctor bean
very pleased you've taken him in david  at a time when noone's job is safe it really identifies you as a team player
yes although i really thank you  yes it's great to have him with us the whole family's very excited
epilepsy
glad to hear it  tell poor mr larson to come through will you?
you're not going to 
sack him?  david what else can i do?  this business is not repeat not breaking even and david  notice anything this morning?
er  pray tell me why?
time taken its toll on the old girl eh?
exactly  she's in a surprisingly terrible state  isn't she bean?
 you have to sack me  i understand sir  i'll go quietly  in fact i'll go right now
no no no hold on  we cant sustain our loses  so i've decided to sell whistler's mother
yes sir  yes sir  congratulations marvellous thing  bravo
ahm
i have fivehundred dollars
yeah spent half his time in the infirmary only reason he enlisted was his father west didn't section him till last week
bravo  let's put on a good show tomorrow shall we?  don't want anything to go wrong
quite right sir
certainly is
i'm fired?  because i let a copy of a painting the get stolen?
of course not  i'm sacking you for neglectful conduct relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred through your recent lack of professional judgement  a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse
very accommodating well no sir i'm sure 
and a car
mmmmm
a car sounds sensible
and i need fridays off to spend more time with my family  speaking of which  if you'll excuse me  i've got a lot of time to make up
no did he tell you about it? about the business childs ran?
what makes you say that?
all the guys they claim are english to and goodlooking like dan day lewis and liam neeson turn out to be irish  even anthony hopkins is welsh  prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors
richard burton was very goodlooking
welsh
sean connery
okay so the guy's gonna look like meatloaf's backside  noone's asking you to go to bed with him
there's a man  i woke up next to a man 
it's you and mom that need to talk
sure  you're right
ah  jennifer i need you to watch kevin  jen?
what business?
not in one piece anyway  i see mrs whistler as kind of  like my own dear mother  i'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her  the vice president here will vouch for that
not my place sir  it would only be a matter of time before i'm calling you dave  then where would we be?  by next year you're my sweetypie" and i'm "coochiecoo"  i'11 be back in 15
sure did
they're pretty  learn it in the army?
no  but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life
great good
well michael bolton's pretty grisly
i vote for bart
that's one  way of looking at it  you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'
well there is that 
pills shots you name it basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain 
i'11 give you a chance know anything about computers?
jennifer  this is not  repeat not how we do things in this family i've told you never to get on one of those death traps  please  talk to me  i promise to be reasonable

so do i jane  i'm on vacation

i will <u>never</u> sell this house i'll be buried in my yard next to barbara  holding hands  and a good paintbrush
oh adam the model looks so good the historical society will love it  you've finished the streets?
almost
west he's dead
helen got it for me in oslo
god manchurian tung oil? there's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe
oh honey i'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home
god how i have looked forward to this honey
it's <u>your</u> turn darling
ah the evertactful jane  let's just relax about having children
i know i just wish she'd leave us alone
let's not think about it  we'll have a nice romantic quiet vacation  here comes the bridge chorus
don't forget the balls ernie
adam
so did we why didn't you come?
yeah it turned out okay  we applied for a national historical plaque for it  that'll be the third one on main street
you're doing it adam  you're saving this town
slow down there honey i don't want the vibration to weaken the model
oh i'm sorry
how's your arm?
i'm not sure  it feels frozen
i am sitting
i'll tell you what barbara  i don't think we survived that crash
oh adam  we're home  in our own house  nonsense  i'll make some coffee  you get some more firewood
two hours
i
what?
that's how long you were gone
 hmmm?
yes it did  yes it did  i made a couple of small discoveries here's one
de<u>ceased</u>  i don't know where it came from
look at the publisher  handbook for the recently deceased press
this is going to take some time
this book isn't arranged that way what do you want to know?
there are a thousand things why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  is this a punishment?  are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? and how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
i don't see anything about 'rewards and punishments' or 'heaven and hell'  this book reads like stereo instructions  listen to this 'geographical and temporal perimeters functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation'  this is going to take some time
west's any kindling for afire?
i can't clean anything  the vacuum is out in the garage  i can't leave the house  why don't they tell us something?  where are all the other dead people in the world?  why is it just you and me?
maybe this is heaven
in heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper
hon i didn't want to die but really this is fine with me  as long as i never have to wash dishes again
dishes?  we haven't eaten in three weeks  adam i'm not like you i really need to be around <u>people</u> get out to the church and go grocery shopping
but i'm not hungry are you?
what's she doing here?
i don't know  <u>jane jane up here</u>
won't?  or can't?
just says 'won't'  wait a minute here it says 'the living are arrogant they think they'll never die so they refuse to see the dead'
i mean i killed him  isn't that what we all wanted?
arrogant  that's jane butterfield all right
at least we won't have to worry about her
that's my girl
they make gypsies look good
is this a punishment for something we did in life?  what can we do?
i don't know if there's anything we can do
we're not completely helpless i've been reading the book there's a word for people in our predicament honey
no i'm not putting up with this
whatever it is it can't be worse than this
<u>you</u> left me
so did you
please join us  come on forward
wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place it's gettin' bad out there   where's west?
i know  i'm sorry
you can't say that for sure  it could be a transitional thing like a postlife crisis  we just have to be tougher with them come on  have some brandy spirits get it?
death didn't improve your sense of humor
not really  what's this?
nothing  the bio buster?  i don't get it
she couldn't have  we can't <u>make</u> them see us
but she <u>saw</u> us  i could feel it
that's all we need
we're not going to wait here like cornered animals  i can tell you that  we need help  i'm going to talk to that little girl
what about this beetle guy?
we just want to check your pack 
we don't know who he is   i'm going to talk to that little girl
are you crazy?  she can't hear you
i don't know what are you looking up?
we need some help  i found something this morning  here emergencies  'in case of emergency draw door'
draw door?  i don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book
wait
no  but it's somewhere without big worms
look at this everything is different down here  all our furniture is gone
how long do you suppose we were waiting?
we probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were 
why?
look she's right  we'll just start simple honey be tougher i feel confident  c'mon
think of them as death shrouds and the moaning is important really <u>moan</u>  practice practice practice
it's <u>not</u> stupid  we're ghosts do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  moan louder
where are your skulls and bones?
you know you're really a pretty girl
she's got <u>photos</u> barbara
adam you had a photo of big foot
this is different  eventually she'll take someone to the attic and then what?  we've got to try to contact this guy betelmyer we gotta get some help hon
of course i did
then it should be here
do i?
i didn't do that one hmmm
 yes this must be him  look betelgeuse betelgeuse
<u>betelgeuse</u>
three times  powerful number
bet el geuse  what an awful name  i thought it was like  you know  the <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>
oh adam  i don't have gloves  my nails keep getting longer  i'll break them
maybe we should knock first?
 acts like she's thirtyfive
go?  what d'ya mean?  we need help
no we don't  we can work something out ourselves  we just have to try harder
yeah
i am not going to expose that little girl to that pervert down there
but <u>we</u> let him out
i don't care i've changed my mind   i feel <u>really</u> confident  we're getting better at this stuff  we can scare them off ourselves  tonight  i've got an idea  you're going to love it i'm going to hate it
the sushi?  i did the wine didn't you do the sushi?
n no  i just did the ink spots

we were trying to scare your mother
stepmother  i'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles
i certainly did  i'd finish it too but i don't get out much
and this used to be your house i bet  why do you want to scare everybody?
we want to frighten you away  so that you'll move out
you're the only one missing a grenade

d90's  you spend a hundred and twentyfive years on earth actually in that house during which you get only three class one d90 intercessions with juno you probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet
for juno your caseworker  not that it matters to your type  but there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you  i'd say three hours
hell no  i'm rolling  i'm a businessman  i'm the man what <u>am</u> <u>beee</u>tel <u>jooose</u>  <u>who</u> do i gotta kill?
you don't kill anyone
but the deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife  so what's my cut?
can you scare them off?
hi ho hi ho it's off to work i go
you wish  i nearly scored with that little blonde  i need me a short little queen
if not you then who?
now let's get rolling
no  what's wrong?
we tried
the intermediate interface chapter on haunting says it all  get 'em out yourself  it's your house haunted houses don't come easy
we have to start simpler is that it?
start simply  do what you know use your talents  practice  we only help those who help themselves just do a little at a time  and of course practice practice practice  it's tricky but  you weren't murderers by any chance were you?
and if we need <u>you</u> again how do we?
<u>never trust the living</u>  we <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death
well we didn't know 
<u>out</u>
is there a problem?
mueller
we're
you're the dead
bio<u>busting</u>  i <u>loves</u> biobusting who do i gotta kill?  family  right?  obnoxious i bet  mommie daddy piglets
just one daughter
hey <u>you've</u> been on saturn  i <u>hate</u> those sandworms  <u>yecchhh</u> i've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms  so a daughter?  she got good legs? god i love a young leg
home  <u>home</u>  <u>home</u>
hey i've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years  i was out  every dog has his day this is my town  i need a night to howl
i'm so sorry we frightened you what were you doing?
are you juno our case worker?
yes  i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed deserved and available
oh come on 
we need help  we deserve help
what do you expect?  you're dead
yes
pity  murderers seem to have an easy time of it  just look at amityville  he was one of my boys  didn't have to give that one any lessons from day one but i must be off  i've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest they need a lot of help just with the basics
no  you don't want his help
what do you mean?  what's he do?
he's a freelance bioexorcist claims to get rid of the living but he's a troublemaker  he's pushy  he's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years
our cemetery?
yeah  he still tries popping up all over the place  but he can't join the party unless you call on him  get the deetzes out by yourselves i gotta go
about what?
we're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away 
you people have really screwed up  i received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>  and you let betelgeuse out and didn't put him back and you let otho get ahold of the handbook
forget him  he'll remain with his whores until someone calls him  you need to worry about people like <u>otho</u>  there are a lot of phony trance mediums  they usually can't make the formulas work but if otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook he could hurt you  as in  <u>exorcism</u>
you're not gross  why were you wearing a sheet?
we're practicing
i always tell the truth  of course i can see you
funeral  god you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>  what was it like?  the funeral did you cry?
wait i don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here
no wait
no lydia we're dead
i want to be dead too
that's exactly what he says about you
no you don't  no lydia why?
life is just too awful
step mother

barbara maitland sweetie you just listen now  this house is too big  it really ought to be for a couple with a family
'bye jane i'll see you in church in a couple weeks

no i mean they've gone decamped  split  vanished
where'd they go?
the happy hunting ground  who cares?

i can't help you from this side but here's how we do it  so <u>simple</u>  say my name three times that's all  i'll be all yours then i'll bring you over here in style
i i don't know what your name is
minor problem  the rules  i can't tell it to you  but do you know how to play charades?
bullshit
yes

your fingers are so small i can't see them  first word  two syllables
it means look <u>behind</u> you bimbo
good girrrl
good thing you are beautiful kid you are <u>dumb</u>
that's it
your name is <u>beetle juice</u>?  yecch that's as bad as <u>deee</u>lia <u>deee</u>tz
it's spelled different but basically now you said it twice; just one more time and i'll be free  and then <u>you'll</u> be free
look in my pack
just <u>say</u> it
you were the snake  right?  i know  i saw you
you've <u>got</u> to say it
no i don't  i don't take orders from smurfs
how'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now  i can do it if i get out
they'd look silly on me  i'm fourteen years old
how'd you like to be married to the king?

your qu?  but you're
i'm beeyooteeful
that's fine otho  just keep me out of it  i am here to relax and clip coupons  and goddamnit i mean to do it
he's a clovenhooved beast
he's your cousin
i am ashamed to say he is  look nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here charles  and sarah?  forget it  you can't get her out of bergdorf's with plastic explosives
it's too late charles  i'm sorry
otho why didn't you just come in the door?
just look little pocket
there's only one chinese restaurant in town darling the owners are irish and irish people happen to cook cantonese  they don't know better
we're going to have a lot to do tomorrow the goodwill truck is coming and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it should have it fumigated too  i saw a fly today
at least insofar as we have our first casualty  me
otho'll know what to do
what's he going to do?  viciously rearrange their environment?
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration
let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for max and sarah because i've bought options on property all over town  i need max's financing
just don't tell lydia
why not?
i think she's in with them
no you're travelling together  i want to talk to you together  hi how are you?  can i take a look at your documents?  are you related?
you're lying 
not these people  they are ruthless
delia hates it
my whole life is a darkroom  one  big dark room
lydia we're the first trickle in a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us
stepmother  she's out torturing the movers
lydia  try to be civil  i'm going to see if i can set up a noisefree zone in the study
let me have it
stepmother
 asked you for something didn't she?  i'm going down to relax  i want a noisefree zone do you understand?  noise free
i'm lonely
pull up my sleeve right arm
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw
lydia  what the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  go help your mother
yes  except when you creep around in your mother's 
stepmother's
 sheets
well this is i mean this is the weirdest 
lydia i don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes but 
<u>this is not a joke</u>  that sheet was full of ghosts
they're ghosts  they do what they want
listen you guys  these ghosts are really nice people  i think we scared them off  let's just leave them alone  okay?
becoming a morphine addict during basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast only mueller and childs know
come on  leave their stuff alone
i cannot believe this
delia will cook
i can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts  they're not here
otho could you actually do something with them?
nonsense everytime she says that the paint peels and some wild creature tries to kill us
then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere
no no c'mon max you know me i've got plans  you gotta come up here and see then i'll tell you about it
no listen we'll talk about this visiting later i gotta go i gotta meeting on the japanese joint venture
great idea maxie  those japanese could <u>run</u> it for us  build them a dormitory in the woods  listen think right about it will you? we've almost got the house ready you bring sarah with you and i'll show you
you saw west right? how was he killed?
yeah yeah we'll think on it 'bye ya charles  you relax up there ya hear?
otho can you do it?
they're already dead  they can't feel a thing
this is our first meal in this house lydia  why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
i say let's keep it the way it is
any particular kind?
joke  joke  aspirin  it doesn't matter what brand
i <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid
don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me  i'm an <u>artist</u>  the only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends  do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of connecticut? not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone
i saw some ghosts
full clip to the body 
it wasn't a joke
tried to convince me that this house is haunted  kids  kids kids  i love them
of <u>course</u> we weren't scared  just a little startled  one of those sushi dropped down my kamali
shhhh  they didn't commit suicide
it doesn't matter  what matters is i've got a roomful of guests down there who think i'm a fraud  i am going to teach you something here lydia  you've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this or people  whether they're dead or alive  people will walk all <u>over</u> you  come on out or i will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>
i'm sorry already
i'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me otho
the rest of the house is probably worse  when can you and i get started?
no time like the present as my wicked stepmother used to say
i thought i saw something
from up close or far away?
you read my <u>mind</u>  i love clients who can read my mind  i don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural
<u>i know</u> i read your book <u>the</u> <u>haunted tapestries of the waldorf</u>
gooood
viridian?
viridian?  what is?
of course her favorite color how <u>beautiful</u>
<u>i know</u>  we just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one
be brave  otho take care  onward
that's charles' study  but you don't have to even look in there he'll love whatever you do to it  he's such a sheep
oh as long as we're here
his chest was hamburger 
attic space
let's see  we could turn that into a media room
maybe charles does
i have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door
probably the world's largest <u>reader's</u> <u>digest</u> collection  c'mon let's have some chablis otho i'm laid bare by this experience  entirely bare
<u>no</u>  do not encourage this little person
oh delia lighten up
she's been without therapy up here and i will not allow her to ruin
we're dealing with tracy and hepburn here a very sophisticated pair  we must protect them treat them with respect <u>nur</u>ture them
look at the tiny figures
that's close range you go full auto on a guy from close range you're gonna be swimming in blood look at my uniform nothing
oh they're still here  they're just not showing up
i don't know
what happened to the people who used to live here?
that's a skeleton key  it'll open any door in that house  will you give it to your father?  and you might mention that i singlehandedly decorated the house  in case he needs advice in that area  come see me
yes but i'm going to live at home
remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code  i'm sure you're going to be very happy there
it's okay  how's the dirt business?
well i just placed a call to your mother  she had stepped out but i have some news for her
hold your breath and we'll pull
my sentiments exactly  porcelain is for teeth
they?
why not?
the attic
that's slavery and murder  you don't know these people  they're just like you and me  they're nice people
i'll need something personal of theirs
their wedding clothes
as flies the lizard serpent fell; as goblin vizard at the spell of pale wizard sinks to hell; the buried dead and slain rise again
i understand i've seen it done before
now you'll barely feel this it won't hurt at all
but not for long
yes i think so too
mueller and childs one of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper
however with injuries such as this i have run into minor hemorrhaging which really isn't too serious at the time but can cause secondary problems if not looked after
i see
oh fine
just to take the proper precautions mr gardiner i'd recommend we take you downstairs and xray your leg   by the way mr gardiner i would like to ask you something straight out
 straight out?
yes are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rand's?
claim?  oh claim that's what thomas asked me
thomas? who's thomas?
thomas franklin an attorney
an attorney?
how long are you planning to stay?
what don't you know?
yes
then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
there's no need for a claim the garden is a healthy one
oh i see   well then you're a very funny man mr gardiner you caught me off guard i must admit
thank you
good keep your weight off that leg mr gardiner in fact it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two if that would be would be possible since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs i can promise you the finest in care unless of course you would prefer to go elsewhere
yes i could stay here thank you
fine would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
no
yes i will
this is a lot of information to be getting i have to think 
yes robert i will
it's fine today robert
shame on you chauncey  you should let me be the judge of that  please sit in the chair
yes robert but it's not bad
hardly any robert
no robert
 oh   my god i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers anyway the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture i felt he's due here soon i believe
yes robert i know about the president
 oh? you've heard?
yes ben called me he wants me to meet the president
no no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the mp's 
he does does he?
yes ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock
why that's terrific chauncey
how do i know when it's ten o'clock?
thank you robert
hell yes  walk you're meeting the president aren't you?
oh really?
yes robert i have seen it before it happens to old people
yes i suppose that's true
in a day or two yes
we wait and i'm a dead man i got a black face a criminal record and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much i hated west  my court martial will take six minutes it's either me or them ray and you gotta decide right now
eve is going to stay the house will not be closed
 you've become quite a close friend of eve's  haven't you mr   chance?
yes i love eve very much
i see   and you are really a gardener aren't you?
yes robert  i am  i'll go tell eve about ben now robert
to everyone i'm afraid the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession as we know it is being legislated out of existence
of course by kidlawyers
that is so true you're different chauncey quite different than most men
we have common foes chauncey  kid lawyers and our physician
in a minute robert  in a minute chauncey i would like to ask a favor of you
put it down
it's not good ben  i'm sure you can feel it
i know robert but strangely enough i don't feel too bad about now i feel all right i guess it's easier knowing chauncey is here to take care of things
i wanted some fresh air robert how is mr gardiner?
a rather large contusion but i don't feel there is any serious damage i'd like to keep an eye on him though  i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days
stay here? is that necessary?
not necessary but preferable i don't think he'll be a bother he seems like a most refreshing sort of man
yes he is different not the kind of person one usually meets in washington
how true mr gardiner may be a welcome change of pace
he's very intense and internal don't you think?
at times yes but that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident actually i found him to have quite a sense of humor
coast guard special detective detail we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk
good it might be pleasant for a couple of days   robert is there any improvement?
no eve i'm sorry
 but he's?
he's resting comfortably now there's no cause for alarm yet
chauncey is so sensitive he was overcome with grief
i don't think so he should be along soon
i wish he were here
you really care for him don't you eve?
i do  we do  both of us ben and i feel so much for chauncey
i think we'd better go look for him  david
levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to washington and lock you in a very small dark room i suggest you talk to us
i have no idea
another thing that baffles me doctor  what was his connection with the deceased? major financial dealings obviously  but our firm has no record of any such transactions
hmmm you say he showed you his garden?
well he said it was his he walked us through it
i see  mr franklin i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr gardiner to yourselves there's no telling what he was involved in and the matter may be extremely confidential so please not a word
of course doctor i understand
fine thank you mr franklin
certainly glad to be of help
gardiner is not a foreign agent there are now sixteen countries investigating the man we can rule that out
very well can we rule out inefficiency?
but not the only victim right?
and what do the boys around intelligence think?
well mr president they don't quite know what to think
gentlemen needless to say there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations  good night
no sir i don't believe i do
oh i have a message for him
yes sir
a black man gave me the message
well i still don't believe i know the man mr gardiner now hold still
please hold still mr gardiner
thank you
my my my how did things turn so hostile so quickly? if i didn't know better i'd say you two were out to get me
would you care to take it sir?
yes
oh yes
morton hull the producer of 'this evening' just called
yes i have seen that show on television
of course they would like you to appear on the show tonight the vice president was scheduled but he had to cancel and they asked if you would be interested
yes i would like to be on that show
fine they felt that since you had such close ties with the president you would be a splendid choice   can i help you? are you looking for something?
no i like this attic very much
there's no need for a hospital
senator daddy must be thrilled
why there certainly is you must see a doctor i insist on it please let us take you
yes i am
these can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a todo over a simple little accident of course they can be very frightening and i must apologize for david he's never had an accident before
yes he's a very careful driver
 why yes he is is your leg feeling any better?
it's feeling better but it's still very sore
i see   say would you mind seeing our family doctor?
your family doctor?
yes my husband has been very ill his doctor and nurses are staying with us those hospitals can be so impersonal  why it might be hours before you are treated
i agree
two weeks
he is not shall we say wild about the idea he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet what do you think of that?
fine it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you  david we'll just go on home jeffrey would you call and let them know?
yes thank you
oh? certainly
hello eve
my name is chance
pardon me was that mr chance?
no i'm a gardener
oh mr gardiner mr chauncey gardiner you're not related to basil and perdita gardiner are you?
no eve i'm not related to basil and perdita
oh well they're just a wonderful couple we've been friends for years we visit their island quite often
i think you just blew "don't ask don't tell" out of the fucking water
yes i lost my remote control
oh well i'm very sorry
i like to watch this is fine
yes
i admire that in a person as for myself i find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times
no it won't do that
 would you like us to notify anyone for you?
no the old man died and louise left
no i like it here
i am a very good gardener
the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled my father interceded so instead west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay
thank you eve  i like this house very much
 and ben is just mad about you  you've lifted his spirits so  it's just well it's just a real pleasure having you with us
ben is very ill eve  i've seen that before
yes i know chauncey
i like ben very much he reminds me of the old man
he does?
yes are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
that's good
good night eve
hello eve
you said you wanted to know what happened  i'm telling you the truth
your leg must be getting better
yes it's feeling much better now
good i'm glad to hear that   how did you like meeting the president?
fine he's very nice
yes he is i'm sorry i didn't get to see him
yes
was he a relative? or an intimate friend?
he was a very wealthy man he looked after me since i was young
oh i see your mentor perhaps?
 mentor?
what happened to "degrees"?
yes i was
i'm sorry   and what about louise? you mentioned that she had gone were you close to her also?
yes i liked louise very much she was his maid
oh his maid stupid me i thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with
oh no she brought me my meals
of course
our greenhouse
oh i like that very much
yes so do we
so am i eve
i didn't kill him 
yes eve you'll be all right
hello eve
chauncey i just wanted to wish you well i know you'll be smashing
thank you eve
and benjamin sends along his best wishes
how is ben feeling?
he's tired chauncey  but he's going to watch you tonight we'll both be watching
that's good i like to watch too
i know you do  you and your television   good luck chauncey
no thank you
then who did?
oh well we can fix up one of ben's for you tomorrow night sophie insists an black tie
i see
 i have very few friends chauncey and benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older
good night eve
no eve i don't read the papers
well it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the president's speech and your own comments from the 'this evening' show are quoted side by side with the president's
i like the president he is a very nice man
i know   so are you chauncey    do you mind my being here like this?
no eve i like you to be here
yes eve i know that
but you didn't
yes eve i'm very glad that you didn't open
i know you are chauncey   you conquer a woman from within herself you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love
yes that could be true
 i guess i may as well be honest about my feelings chauncey as i know you are i am in love with you i love you and i want you and i know that you know it and i'm grateful that you've decided to wait until until
thank you eve
chauncey this is mr dennis watson of the state department
hello dennis
no i was with a man we went upstairs
upstairs? chauncey you're always involved in some sort of discussion
he was very ill i stayed with him for a while
no poetic justice though
it must be the punch and it is stuffy in here  i feel it a little myself you're an angel my dear  thank god there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort
yes eve ben is very wise
 come in chauncey  please come in
thank you
i like to watch
to watch? to watch me?
yes i like to watch
 is that all you want?   to watch me?
yes it's very good eve
 but i've never done   you mean? when when when i do it?  when i touch myself?
right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back
that's very interesting eve
hello eve
yes i've been looking for you too eve
hello sid
i'm sorry to disturb you mr gardiner i know you must be very busy
no i'm not busy
then i'll be brief i covered the president's speech at the financial institute today and since the post would like to be as exact as possible we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between mr rand the president and yourself
the president is a nice person i enjoyed it very much
good sir and so it seems did the president  but we would like to have some facts; such as uh what exactly is the relationship between yourself and that of the first american financial corporation?
i think you should ask mr rand that
i'd like to speak for himself okay?
i honestly don't know maybe to have someone to cover for him and i wish i could but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men
of course but since he is ill i'm taking the liberty of asking you
yes that is correct i think you should ask mr rand that
i have nothing more to say
hello morton
i see
do you realize mr gardiner that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
yes it's a very good show
i'm glad you like it mr gardiner
yes very well thank you
do you like it?
mr hardy?
yes it's very tiny but it's good
 are you sure you like it?
yes i do it's very good
really? really
i don't want robert
i see
your foot give me your foot
i agree
how is my dear friend benjamin feeling?
yes eve i shall yield too
stop
ben is very ill
yes so i've heard a shame as you know we in the soviet union have the keenest interest in developments of the first american financial corporation we are pleased to hear that you may fill benjamin's place should he fail to recover  be seated please mr gardiner
yes i agree i think so too
to exchange our thoughts  what does a russian know about business? on the other hand what does an american know about diplomacy?
yes i understand
and i have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues  so why not a coming together? an interchange of opinion? we may find my friend that we are not so far from each other not so far
we are not far   our chairs almost touch
bravo bravo our chairs are indeed almost touching and we want to remain seated on them correct? we don't want them snatched from under us am i right? because if one goes the other goes and then  boom boom and we are both down before our time you see? and neither of us wants that do you agree?
i certainly do
yes tell me mr gardiner  do you by any chance enjoy krylov's fables? i ask this because there is something there is something krylovian about you
how many murders did you cover up? one? five? maybe an even ten
do you think so? do you think so?
so you know krylov
oh good
yes it is very good
yes it is  would you tell me your name again please?
ho ho a dash of american humor vladimar skrapinov
yes i like that name very much
and yours sir  chauncey gardiner  how poetic chauncey a name of uncertain meaning and gardiner a bit of the french a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers a beautiful name my friend
we must speak again mr gardiner many times
thank you
can i go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot?
 i see
sure you do this ward is air tight i have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up
yes i like that very much
yes you look very sick
i agree
 you will join us for dinner won't you mr gardiner?
yes i am very hungry
 so am i my boy  so am i
oh when you say 'your house has been closed' you mean to say that your business was shut down?
yes shut down and locked by the attorneys
my heart weeps
what'd i tell you? kidlawyers the sec damn them
yes chauncey is fine
and i'm ben
i see i would like to work in your garden
thank you ben the garden that i left was such a place everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands i planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow
bravo
but i don't have that any more   all that's left for me now is the room upstairs
now wait a minute chauncey you are young you are healthy for god's sake don't give up on yourself you have to fight you can't let those bastards keep you down i don't want to hear any more from you about the 'room upstairs' that's where i'm going soon
yes i'm sure it is that's what they say anyway
reluctant to speak eh chauncey? well i can understand that when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time just give it some thought work with the idea i'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days
there's that word again  as i told you i wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting
i could give it some thought ben but my leg is very sore
 oh?  robert take a look would you?
yes ben my leg is not very sore
well that's good news my boy
you're looking much better today ben
hah it's all makeup chauncey i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i didn't want the president to think i was going to die during our talk
i understand
no one likes a dying man my boy  because few know what death is all we know is the terror of it but you're an exception chauncey  that's what i admire in you your marvelous balance you don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope  you're a truly peaceful man
thank you ben   the nurse did a very good job ben
i see ben
so i should stay silent about his misdeeds? the guns went off i ran in childs shot me pike and mueller were dead and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun 
 maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position chauncey maybe one day
yes that is correct
yes ben  he is
he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey  he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately  seldom if ever at all
i'm glad he came ben it was nice talking to the president
no ben
oh sure you do the financial assistance program i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking i'd like you to meet with the members of the board we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time
i understand
and please chauncey  don't rush your decision i know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment
thank you ben
dunbar was running out the door? ohhhhhh see that's where i was confused because i thought you said nunez was running out the door
and now chauncey i'm afraid you must excuse me  i'm very tired all of a sudden
senator rowley's widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union i think it's rather obvious that robert won't allow me to attend so  would you go in my place and escort eve?
yes i would like to escort eve
good together the two of you should create quite a stir  i can already hear the gossip
yes ben  are you going to die now?
oh i see
let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey let me feel your strength  yes that's good i hope chauncey  i hope that you'll stay with eve take care of her watch over her she's a delicate flower chauncey
a flower
she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey there's much to be looked after
yes i would like to do that
no i said dunbar
 i've worked very hard and enjoyed my life i've known success and i've felt love my associates chauncey  i've talked with them about you they're eager to meet you very eager to meet you i'm very fond of you chauncey and i understand eve tell her that tell her i'm madly in love with her
i like to watch
watch? you mean just watch me? doing it alone?
yes i like to watch very much
well if that's what you want then i want it too  we can go this way
i want to tell eve
tell eve? you mean mrs rand?
yes
oh you can tell her later she'll never miss you in this crowd
hello ronald
he doesn't speak english
huh you know i really thought you said nunez i thought you said "dunbar was gone" my fault i gotta check the tape on that  oh yeah we taped the last interview this one too cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie
mr gardiner my editors and i have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? something on your political philosophy what do you say?
i can't write
of course who can nowadays? i have trouble writing a post card to my children look we could give you a six figure advance provide you with the very best ghostwriter research assistants proof readers
i can't read
of course not no one has the time to read one glances at things watches television
yes i like to watch
sure you do no one reads listen book publishing isn't exactly a bed of roses these days
what sort of bed is it?
yes i would like to go to rand memorial hospital
 sir?
well?
yes
yes i would like to see ben
oh mr rand of course right this way sir
yes
yes
your appearance doesn't suggest that at all mr chance
oh thank you
i never needed money
yes of men and women
 oh
sorry to disappoint i'm on painkillers for the injury  they cloud the mind you're right it was nunez any more questions?
no
no  that's where joe fixed the bricks
it is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style
yes i have seen styles on television
good day sally
no i'm not badly injured but my leg is very sore
it's very sore
i agree
let's have a look do you mind?
of course i would like to look
then we'll leave it up to the courts  his word against mine what does his father do again? steelworker?  doesn't matter i'm sure justice will be served in any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son he's quite protective
yes
i've never ridden in an automobile
i assure you sir david is a very careful driver please won't you let us take you?
 yes you can take me
very good
yes sir i'll take care of that
no  but mr rand does have one with an electric motor that way he can get around by himself
i see
how long? i don't know see what the doctor says 
yes sir i guess that's true smallest room in the house
i was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you
yes it seems to be
 yes sir  elevator
 good evening louise
i see
i'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by
is his back feeling better?
he's dead chance the old man's dead
 i see
must of happened durin' the night i don't know lord he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish i touched him just to see and you believe me chance  that's doin' more than i get paid to do then i just covered him up pulled the sheet over his head
yes i've seen that done
i didn't do anything 
then i got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and i think i woke him probably he wasn't any too alert he just said 'yeah he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over' lord what a mornin'
 yes louise it's snowing in the garden today have you looked outside and seen the snow? it's very white
yes louise i have seen it often it happens to old people
well ain't that the truth
yes it is
yes i'm very hungry
well no more stewin' those prunes every mornin' that's somethin' i guess   what are you goin' to do now chance?
i'm going to work in the garden
yes
you're gonna need somebody someone's gotta be around for you boy   you oughta find yourself a lady chance  but i guess it oughta be an old lady 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good not with that little thing of yours   you're always gonna be a little boy ain't you?   goodbye chance
because of what i saw  who really killed west
yes
i'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the vice president
you're welcome
i always find it surprising mr gardiner to find men like yourself who are working so intimately with the president yet manage to remain relatively unknown
yes that is surprising
 well your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on
i hope so
yes of course you know mr gardiner that i always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests i hope you don't object to that
no i don't object
fine then let's get started the current state of our country is of vital interest to us all and i would like to know if you agree with the president's view of the economy?
because i was standing next to him
which view?
yes i was there with ben
i know that mr gardiner
yes
well let me rephrase the question; the president compared the economy of this country to a garden and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow do you go along with this belief?
yes i know the garden very well i have worked in it all my life it is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons the garden needs a lot of care i do agree with the president; everything in it will grow strong and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds
yes we need a very good gardener
thank you
i am a very serious gardener
 the gardener?   yes of course mr chance this is ms hayes
i didn't 
yes thomas  i understand
yes i'm waiting for my lunch
your lunch? you have a luncheon appointment here?
yes louise will bring me lunch
louise? the maid?  but she should have left earlier today
i see
 you've quite a sense of humor mr chance  but all kidding aside may i ask just what you are doing here?
i live here
you live here?   we don't have any record of that
yes it's very cold outside today isn't it thomas?
but you can't prove it you can't prove anything until we find the bodies
 how long have you been living here?
ever since i can remember since i was a child
since you were a child?
yes thomas i have always been here i have always worked in the garden
no
how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
compensated?
how were you paid?
i was given meals and a home
no i do not have any of those
new york's finest  this is his case
i don't know 
then how about medical records? could you give us the name of your doctor or your dentist?
i have no need for a doctor or dentist i have never been ill i have never been allowed outside of this house and except for joe i have never had any visitors
 joe? who's joe?
joe saracini he was a mason that did some repairs on the brickwork at the rear of the house that was in 1952
1952?
yes i remember when he came he was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book
yes and the old man used to come to my garden he would read and rest there
come now mr jennings had been bedridden for thirtyfive years since he fractured his spine
yes thomas that is correct then he stopped visiting my garden
 we shall need some proof of your having resided here mr chance
where are they
you have me i am here what more proof do you need?
no thomas but i have seen the army on television
are you related to the deceased mr chance?
no i don't think so and i have planted and shaped all the hedges and in the springtime you will be able to see my flowers
no thomas i have never been in an automobile
mr chance the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased
yes i understand
i would like to stay and work in my garden
i'm fine thomas the garden is a healthy one there is no need for a claim
good that's good then if you would please sign a paper to that effect
maybe 
come now mr chance
i have no claim thomas
but you won't sign correct?
correct
very well mr chance  if you insist on dragging this matter on but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon if indeed you do reside here you will have to move out
move out? i don't understand thomas
i think you do mr chance however i will reiterate this house is closed and you must leave  call me if you change your mind about signing  c'mon sally  let's grab a bite
 hello
 oh really
yes i will
maybe what 
now ben did you happen to get a chance to
as long as the roots are not severed all is well and all will be well in the garden
 in the garden?
that is correct in a garden growth has its season there is spring and summer but there is also fall and winter and then spring and summer again
 spring and summer  yes i see fall and winter  yes indeed  could you go through that one more time please mr gardiner?
 you will honor me and my family with a visit won't you?
yes i will
wonderful we'll all look forward to seeing you  is eve around? i'd like to say hello
 nothing
 skip the levity kinney  what have you got?
maybe he
 i realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on gardiner we have no material on him  zilch
try again
sure try again  where? there's nothing it's like he never existed
try again
sid it's useless
i said  try again
tired and i'm getting tired of being so tired other than that i'm doing very well
no headaches?
no it's been a good day  better than yours from what i've been told
you heard?
been better  i read about what's been happening with you i should have called 
i may be a shutin but i do not lack for news i'm sorry you had to go through all that
oh it wasn't all that bad darling we were fortunate that mr gardiner turned out to be so reasonable
reasonable? good i'd like to meet a reasonable man why don't you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner?
do you feel well enough for that?
hah tell me the truth eve  if i wait until i feel better will i ever meet the man?
do you need a secretary?
 yes i am ben
that's good that's good
 thank you chauncey thank you very much   all right robert i'm all yours
good evening wilson

i shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite ma'am dr allenby is standing by
thank you wilson that will be fine
yes ma'am
i'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg mr gardiner
hello sophie
sophie this is chauncey gardiner
oh i've been just dying to meet you mr gardiner
chauncey this is mrs sophia rowley
would you two excuse me for a moment?
oh well i just talked to cindy this morning she loves california but to quote her she says 'the secret service is getting to be a drag' i guess she wants her privacy
would i have called you if it wasn't? if there was any other way 
huh i'm glad they're along with her if you know what i mean how about jack?
well i think jack needs some time alone with you darling he's getting to that age you know he really misses you
yeah i'll have a talk with him as soon as
no that won't do any good
 is it me? is there something i've done?
oh no sweetheart  it's not you
it's your damn job it never happened when you were a senator
it's not that i just
of course i'm so sorry for you eve
yeah he and my father used to ride together back in the thirties fox hunting before i was born
tell me what i can do
 would you take me on a tour?
gladly   the safe is in mr jennings' bedroom that'll be stop number one
i really don't know tom  he seems so honest and simple in a way he's quite charming
 yeah
 it's very bizarre  i don't know what to think
well he's either very very bright or very very dense  he's hard to figure   let's just keep everything legal
yes chauncey gardiner
no he's a real gardener
he does talk like one but i think he's brilliant
sally hayes is not a bitch  she's a damn fine attorney i've got to talk to her about this gardiner
and here you are going out of house how's that make you feel jules?
good night
look johanna
i said good night
we have nothing on him ambassador skrapinov
quietly please mr gardiner for one understands our language
sorry comrade ambassador
what do you mean there is nothing? that's impossible
there is no information available on the man before he moved into benjamin rand's it has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the united states government
apparently the white house shares our curiosity  they have also launched an investigation and according to our sources neither the fbi nor the cia has met with success
i see clearly such interest on their part is of great political significance
do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
it's not west is it? tell me it's not west
clearly yes comrade
hmmm take this down  i want this quote included in the tass coverage; 'chauncey gardiner in an intimate discussion with ambassador skrapinov noted that "unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes"'
very good your excellency
gardiner yes sir
and put it through on a code red  i want it as soon as possible
no problem chief
yes sir  we are aware of all that but still we haven't been able to
he's an advisor and close personal friend of rand's for christ sakes they have volumes of data on benjamin
yes mr president we attempted to contact mr rand but he was too ill to
i do not want benjamin rand disturbed you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of chauncey gardiner if you run into problems alert honeycutt  i'll be in the office at seven in the morning and i would like to have it at that time  i've got to take a leak
well he's a good soldier
right chief
no sir
this information goes back three days i want the standard file you know that
right chief
so? where the hell is it?
we uh have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at mr rand's home  and uh
what the hell are you talking about kaufman?
well we do have data from honeycutt's sources chief  but it isn't pertinent
i'd like to hear that data kaufman
yes sir
and the problem is you only got three
well sir  it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power but we ruled that out as they invariably are provided with too much documentation too much american identity we uhdon't quite know what to make of it yet sir but we'll keep on top of it mr president  we'll come up with the answer
i would appreciate that
oh? what?
we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiner's background so far they haven't come up with a thing  what's more as a result of their eagerness one of their ablest agents blew his cover we have him in custody at this time
good anything else?
yes chief  eight other foreign powers have put gardiner under surveillance we're aroundthe clock now sir  i'll keep you posted
that could be possible
but we are quite certain comrade that this man gardiner is a leading member of an american elitist faction planning a coup d'etat
a coup d'etat of course that was foreseen by lenin himself
that is correct comrade skrapinov we have ascertained that gardiner heads a bigbusiness power group that will soon be taking over the american government
no the problem is one's dead one's got a bullet in his arm and one won't talk the one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup
big business i could work with that faction quite nicely colonel novogrod
you have proven that already comrade skrapinov you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship
thank you colonel
let us toast to the success of the coup
 mr president how good to see you
it's so good to see you too ben you look terrific
i'm not convinced of that mr president but your visit has raised my spirits
well i'm delighted to be here my friend i've missed you  here sit down get off your feet
mr gardiner my pleasure
yes i did
i'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
 well?
overall  pretty good but mr president i think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game
well ben i
i sympathize with your position mr president i know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos
that's too big a risk i can't take the chance
it's that serious huh?
i'm afraid so
i'm sorry too well nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you  and ben i want to thank you for your time and thoughts
nonsense mr president  i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man
now ben i won't have any of that why don't you listen to your good friend chauncey this is a time to think of life
cadet roberto r nunez killed right in front of me

oh you know not a lot just hanging around his apartment i think he must be a lonely man
you see men can feel unfulfilled too i'm glad you're realizing that you shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems
you're right you know i was thinking that we should have maxine over for dinner since you two are partners and all it might be a nice gesture
i don't know there's some tension between us i'd hate to expose you to that
after dinner i'll show you my puppets
i'm moving remember? what's with the hooded cloak?

well you have the maxine action figure to play with
life is confusing isn't it?
sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions  i'd like for us to stay together craig you know platonically if that's possible i truly value our friendship
i feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision not that i blame them how could they know? today's world is so complicated  no i have to go away now i'm sorry lotte i'm so sorry
from dunbar? i hate to break this to you but i don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty

shut up
you bastard
what the hell darling close early today live dangerously
it'll never happen fuckface
ah but you're forgetting one thing lambchop
what's that?
i'm a puppeteer
things change anyway you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in maxine
nevertheless 
you fell in love with her first
yeah but i didn't do anything about it out of respect for our marriage
you didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole which is by the way about nine feet nine inches off the mark anyway
that's true oh god lotte what have i become? my wife in a cage with a monkey a gun in my hand betrayal in my heart
maybe this is what you've always been craig you just never faced it before
perhaps you're right i can't let you go though too much has happened you're my ace in the hole
i need a shower
i'm sorry oh god i'm sorry i'm some kind of monster i'm the guy you read about in the paper and go "he's some kind of monster"
you're not a monster craig just a confused man
i love you so much
nevertheless what'? kendall will testify and that'll be enough
i'm so glad you're safe you look really wonderful

i am a trained performer
music to my ears whatever you said speak speak speak my magnificent friend speak

glooph is not a letter sir
damn you are good i tried to trick you okay put these in order
i'm talking about west we had him bill we were there you're the fucking base commander you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has 
flattery will get you everywhere my boy but i'm afraid i have to trust floris on this one you see she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from case western perhaps you've read her memoirs "i can't understand a word any of you are saying"
no
pity it tells it like it is that's why the eastern read jewish publishing establishment won't touch it that's a quote from the book jacket george will i think  i apologize if you can't understan a word i'm saying dr schwartz
no i understand perfectly
thank you for being kind enough to lie you see i've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech you're hired any questions?
just one why is this floor so short?
low overhead m'boy we pass the savings on to you  but seriously that's all covered in orientation
i wasn't toying with her sir i was just how old are you?
one hundred and five carrot juice  lot's of it i swear it's almost not worth it i piss orange oh and i have to piss sitting down like a godamn girly every fifteen minutes but nobody wants to die schwartz
i'll keep that in mind sir
was dead right you think dunbar's on the level?
no sirebob i don't die but what i do is get older wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you oh to be a young man again maybe then floris would care for me
the elderly have so much to offer sir they are our link with history
i don't want to be your godamn link damn you i want to feel floris' naked thighs against my own i want to know passion i want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful complex woman i want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when i penetrate her oh god the agony of the flesh schwartz
dr lester while i am flattered that you share your feelings with me i believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion
all right meet me at the juicyjuice juice bar after work today and i'll spill my goddamn guts for you
wife huh? i'd love to meet her craig
yessir
shall we say dinner on friday just the two of us?  you can come too if you like schwartz
that's sounds fine sir gotta run
ah craig just the fellow i wanted to see  juicer easy as pie just keep your fingers clear of the blade and never never use it while bathing in a tub full of water
yeah
dr lester i have a question i was in that vacant office down the hall and i stumbled upon a little door and
ah yes the little door  there is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes if you hurry you'll just make it
thank you sir
more beetspinach juice my friend?
no thank you sir it's delicious though i just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at lestercorp but i'm afraid i'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately
i see are you unhappy at our little company?
no sir not at all it's just that i'm going to open my own business and
and what sort of business will this be? if you don't mind my asking
uh importexport olive oil right on 7 1/2 actually  in the vacant office so we'll still be seeing each other
dr lester i don't know what you're talking about
does osborne agree?
there are rules boy procedures etiquette this is not a toy i've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room grooming myself quietly setting the stage performing ablutions paying tribute seeing all his motion pictures again and again worshipping schwartz worshipping properly
you're insane
i am not alone there are others we are legion you will pay for this blasphemy you will pay dearly
yes unfortunately it's bullshit the real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors
is that true?
well truth is for suckers isn't it?
listen i'm craig schwartz just starting out at lestercorp
how dreary  to be  somebody / how public  like a frog / to tell one's name  the livelong june / to an admiring bog
emily dickinson
i wouldn't know
that's horseshit and you know it
you know i've been thinking about what you said yesterday about the orientation film being a coverup i think you're on to something
and fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants
no really

the usual barry
hey tabloids paid ted bundy  famous serial killer  half a million for his interview  and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her?  it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country look you want magazine or not?
i wouldn't know where to start  i guess it was about one man framing another he thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings
i'll have like a beer like a budweiser or something
my tits?
no no it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or
christ you're not a fag are you? because i don't want to be wasting my time

puppets maxine it's the idea of being inside someone else feeling what they feel seeing what they see
the senator
yikes
please let me explain
you might want to check those tarot cards one more time
no
it better be
sounds delightful who the fuck is john malkovich?
he's an actor one of the great american actors of the 20th century
what's he been in?
lots of things he's very well respected that jewel thief movie for example the point is that this is a very odd thing supernatural for lack of a better word it raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self about the existence of the soul am i me? is malkovich malkovich? was the buddha right is duality an illusion? do you see what a can of worms this portal is? i don't think i can go on living my life as i have lived it there's only one thing to do let's get married right away
is this malkovich fellow appealing?
don't be i'm not cut out to deal with the west's of the world
yes of course he's a celebrity
good we'll sell tickets
tickets to malkovich?
exactly two hundred dollars a pop
but there's something profound here maxine we can't exploit it
fine i'll do it myself i was going to offer a partnership to you but this way it's more money for me
you wanted to be partners with me?
sure it'd be fun
really?  but maxine can of worms end of the world illusory nature of existence
i'll protect you dollface
you're a good soldier bill
sounds good oblique but intriguing phone it in
my god
so unbolt the fucking door einstein
are you torturing me on purpose?
i've fallen in love
i don't think so i've fallen in love this is what people who've fallen in love look like
you picked the unrequited variety very bad for the skin
you're evil maxine
do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? no i don't suppose you would it's quite a thrill craig
a girl has a right to glow if she wants it's in the fucking constitution
i thought you said that wasn't a compliment
move right hand across her left breast now move right hand across her left breast now move right hand across her left breast now
yes yes sweetheart yes
of course right this way mr malkovich compliments of the house
how the hell would i know? i wasn't a philosophy major
jm inc be all that someone
hello wendy
don i was wondering do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
it's an interesting story wendy many years ago in the late 1800's james mertin an irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country came to this town and decided to erect an office building
ha ha ha
i'm glad you learned sign language elijah but i'm tired of your nagging i'm tired of this conversation i'm tired period what has the world ever done for me that i should feel personally responsible for saving it?
what are you talking about?
it is better to light one candle than curse the darkness i learned that from you
yes i'm the only one i have to enter malkovich and destroy him from the inside if not me who?
if there was any way i could go in your place but i'm only a monkey and
hush sweetheart
wings and a halo my darling wings and a halo
long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
no don't be an ass
can i be anyone i want?
you can be john malkovich
well that's perfect my second choice ah this is wonderful too good to be true you see i'm a sad man sad and fat and alone oh i've tried all the diets my friends lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise did it work? you be the judge but malkovich king of new york man about town most eligible bachelor bon vivant the schopenhauer of the 20th century thin man extraordinaire
if you let him testify then it would have all come out west was supposed to take care of it out there shut nunez up and then disappear but it got messy and people got killed so you called your old pal tom hardy figuring if worse came to worse he'd cover for you
two hundred dollars please
yes yes a thousand times yes
and as i said sir we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel malkovich
right lester i heard you the first time i'm not a dummy
didn't mean to imply that you were sir
look i'm going back to my house to ponder this so stay calm and keep track of schwartz's comings and goings oh and somebody dispose of schwartz's wife will you?  nice to meet you all
we saw his show at the luxor last night
vegas? what'd you think?
the kid's got talent you've never seen malkovich like this schwartz had him up there singing and dancing impressions
impressions? those are hard
you're drunk 
very talented son of a bitch too bad we can't kill him
i suppose i could come to him in a dream i don't know that's the best i can think of right now
a scary dream?
no a sexy dream of course a scary dream
i like that
no for god's sake i just watered it yesterday  it almost went well i gave a pretty good dream but circumstances arose
what kind of circumstances?
maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves malkovich plus he's been challenged to a puppetduel by mantini
the great mantini?
no the mediocre mantini of course the great mantini
i'm not going to cover for you bill not for this
oh he's good great actually i saw him do "tru" with his sixty foot robert morse puppet sensational
but i think i have another plan
do tell i love a good plan
why are you being like this?
well if mantini wins schwartz will leave malkovich right? so if he needs it i help mantini's performance a bit give him an edge spice up the show
can you do that? i mean do you know anything about puppetry?
i am the devil lester i think i can handle it
i was just asking no disrespect intended
fine let's drop it
fine i mean it's not like i was doubting you it's just that i know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire
or what? you've gone round the bend 
fine i'm not mad let's just drop it
fine your mail's on the kitchen table mostly junk oh there's a letter from alex trebek
gehginnis ondah foam?
forget it
fork ah did?
fine woman floris i don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine
someone names a lot of warts on line two
thank you floris
think jew florist?
good morning lotte
yes  both
west had a partner someone who knew how to get things done
do you?
it's my job to ask the questions yours to answer them
says who?
says me do you dream often?
do you?
i'm sure you're not going crazy
kevin i'm telling you it was like nothing i've
yeah yeah yeah yadda yadda yadda were you stoned?
yes but you see someone else was talking through my mouth
you were stoned case closed end of story how hot is this babe?
that's preposterous 
i think it might've been this lotte woman talking through me maxine likes to call me lotte
ouch now that's hot she's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover let me know when you're done with her this is my type of chick
i'm done with her now tonight really creeped me out
you're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you lotte i tell you that as a friend
i don't know anything about her what if she's some sort of witch or something?
all the better hey hot lesbian witches next geraldo buddy boy ha ha ha
i gotta know the truth kevin
the truth is for suckers johnnyboy
lots of carrot juice little lady that and a deal with the devil
do we get to wear a crown?
toxicology report came back kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe you've heard of it it's for asthmatics if an epileptic takes enough it kills them i checked with the nurses at the hospital  you're the only other person who visited kendall
but of course
count me in
good i think its time to beckon mr flemmer perhaps he can help us out of this pickle
yes of course dr lester
oh be still my heart
dr lester would you point me toward the restroom?
with immense pleasure my dear down that hall ninth door on the left watch the step down it's sunken you know
no you mustn't my child
but why son of malkovich?
we need you on the inside my child to report on his comings and goings and if need be to destroy him  for lack of a better word
i wanted to see if he was okay 
you followed your heart my child and that is not necessarily a bad thing
but now we've lost access to craig
my child i don't think its a great mystery what craig's up to
craig stole maxine from me dr lester
hmmm a lesbian are you? i must inform you that i find that highly arousing
no you don't understand i've been inside malkovich when i'm with maxine
what? that is not allowed my god you are supposed to be one of us you know you must never partake of malkovich by yourself
no i didn't know that
oh didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
no
you poisoned him bill you heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like pike
oh sorry right this way
you bastard
it's craig in there i can tell
i understand but we must protect the vessel at all costs  please craig please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours
why not? i need to get in there
i'm not certain my dear but i believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route
that bastard i'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order son of malkovich
i'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel
yes hi
hi uh  hi i wanted to place an ad yes "ever want to be someone else?" no that's the ad but let's talk about you in a minute "ever want to be someone else? now you can no kidding"
i'm not even going to dignify that 
i've never been looked at like this by a woman
after that i'll introduce you to my favorite monkey elijah he's got an ulcer due to a suppressed childhood trauma but we're getting to the bottom of it  psychotherapy
i have to see you can you call him and invite us over?
when?
give me one hour to get inside him exactly
i love you lotte
maxine
i have to see you
sweetie oh but we can't it's business hours i need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers
one hour
no you will stand there and you will listen what happened to you bill? you were the one who joined up to do good in the world you were the one who believed in it 
really? well you know he's quite good i'm surprised anyway i have a session with malkovich i have to attend i'll speak with you soon
but maxine i thought it was me you loved
i thought so too doll i guess we were mistaken
did you see the reviews?
yeah i saw them
because if you missed any i just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now
we'll see schwartz we'll see
a friendly competition if you will your malkovich puppet and my harry s truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play not some vegas burlyq pyrotechnics but a real play that requires actual acting the audience decides who is more deserving of the title the losing puppeteer bows out graciously goes back to obscurity as a file clerk
what's the play?
say "equus"? it's got everything
you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? the army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? there's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you
never heard of it
broadway's finest three hours it's about the suppression of the individual conformity as god in modern society
sounds boring are there any songs?
nothing but acting to hide behind buddyboy
i'm not afraid i toured for a year with the national puppet company's production of "long day's journey into night"
great then
is there dancing?
no
who needs dancing?
mr malkovich?
not for long
who's calling?
you don't know me but i'm a great admirer of yours
how'd you get this number?
it's just that i fantasize about you and well speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and
whatever you're having
oh i'm really glad you called
oh sure it's very rewarding
do you mind?
no i guess not i'm an actor
yes maxine yes
you're crazy 
oh lotte
oh dollface it was just your passion for me taking hold
no dollface i know what my passion taking hold feels like i gotta go
what the fuck is going on?
i can explain about the portal darling
don't con me maxine we're over i just let you up here to tell you that and to tell you that i'm taking you and schwartz to court
oh shut up  craig darling are you in there?
lotte called me
oh so the bitch escaped
apparently you can control this malkovich fellow now
okay
you can't duck this bill i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i won't let this happen
i'm getting better all the time
i'll say you are let's do it on his kitchen table then make him eat an omelette off of it
no damn you  oh shut up you overrated sack of shit
yeah i've figured out how to hold on as long as i want oddly enough it's all in the wrists
wow  do a puppet show for me craig honey
you mean with malkovich?
i'd love to see your work
really? yeah okay
you see maxine it isn't just playing with dolls
you're right my darling it's so much more it's playing with people
for the last time i have no idea what you're talking about 
no  but how will we make a living my love if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
well we'll have all the money in malkovich's bank account plus he still gets acting work occasionally
no please  shut up will you? we're trying to think here  it is sort of like being a puppeteer i like that about it
no one would ever have to know its not him
wait a minute what if everybody knew? what if we presented malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? we'd wipe the floor with the great mantini
oh craiggy that's brilliant
it's okay my sweet
vegas can you arrange that?
i'm nervous malkovich is fighting me hard today
he's a selfish bastard
get your hands away from the desk
oh darling it's a dream come true we're going to ride this straight to the top
sleepy suddenly
busy day my little fire chief why don't you climb into bed and i'll meet you there in just
i've got to leave malkovich
you've got to be kidding
i just had the most horrifying nightmare the devil was in it
perhaps you'll want to consult that ouija board again
derek mantini
whatever
what want ye girl child?
fantastic you want to tell me what's going on?
i am not a child captain mertin but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions
i see well it is not my fault that thou art tiny so if it is charity yer after then be gone with ye ye foul demon
i am not asking for alms but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart
aye speak then if ye must
captain mertin surely i am a godfearing christian woman like yourself but alas i am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind door knobs are too high chairs are unwieldy highceilinged rooms mock my stature nor am i a marrie lady captain after all who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? so i am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?

it's cold as charity in there what he do that for? any number'll take him in
can't nobody read minds long distance all he have to do is ask somebody
why? why he have to ask? can't nobody offer? what's going on? since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?
unrile yourself stamp it's only a few days he been there
no shouldn't be no days you know all about it and don't give him a hand? that don't sound like you ella me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed? a working man who can pay his own way?
he ask i give him anything
why's that necessary all of a sudden?
i don't know him that well
you know he's colored? what else there to know?
stamp don't tear me up this morning i don't feel like it
i want to document my trip to america
yes
it's her ain't it?
her who?
sethe he took up with her and stayed in there and you don't want nothing to
hold on don't jump if you can't see bottom
girl give it up we been friends too long to act like this
you know she married baby suggs' boy
i ain't sure i know that baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here and how'd she make it and her husband didn't? and where is he? and how she have that baby in the woods by herself? said a whitewoman help her shoot you believe that? well i know what kind of white that was
aw no ella
anything white floating around in the woods  if it don't got a shotgun it's something the lord tells me i don't want no part of
you was friends
move him
till she showed herself
ella
i ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children
what's any of that got to do with paul d?
what run him off? tell me that
i run him off
you?
i told himshowed him the newspaper about sethe read it to him he left that very day
you didn't tell me that i thought he already knew
he didn't know nothing and nobody except her from when they was at that place baby suggs was at
why?
he knew baby suggs?
sure he knew her her boy halle too
and he left when he found out what sethe did?  what you say casts a different light on it i guessi thought
that's so
well paul d must know who she is or what she is
you mind loaded with spirits everywhere you look you see one
you know as well as i do stamp that people who die bad don't stay in the ground
if it's hard for you might kill me dead 
i come looking for you to ask your pardon apologize
for what?
because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which doesn't exactly put people at ease is he cute?
you pick any house any house where colored live pick any one and you welcome to stay there i'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you but you welcome anywhere you want to be my house john and ella miss lady jonesanybody you choose you ain't got to sleep in no cellar and i apologize for each and every night
well ii did get offered one place but i just wanted to be off by myself a spell
oh yeah oh that's load off i thought everybody gone crazy
just me
you planning to do anything about it?
oh yeah i got big plans
never found out
i did down to the cent$900 always wondered though what mrs garner got for my brother paul f must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for sweet home for almost two years but then they hung my other brother paul a up on a tree so i guess he wasn't worth the samei wonder what was baby suggs worth? and halle? i wasn't surprised when i found out they tracked down sethe all the way to cincinatti her price must have been higher than all of us  her being property that reproduced itself without cost a breeder
no use thinking these things now
oh but we got to how we gonna know our price in the future? how are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? who's gonna tell them? what are they gonna pay for us if we free?
excuse me?
children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing
they'll know they'll know as soon as they born cause it's inside usstamp it'll be inside them we'll pass it down schoolteacher didn't just change the outside he changed the mindand the bloodand what it carriesand what it's worth
i don't believe that i won't
there was a rooster named mister down at sweet home last time i saw halle with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth i saw mister  sitting on a tub he loved that tub like king on a throne he was a hateful thing bloody and evilbut he was better than me  mister was allowed to be and stay what he was even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named mister but wasn't no way i'd ever be paul d againschoolteacher changed me was never no beating under mr garner schoolteacher changed that why wouldn't a man run from that? why wouldn't a man not work kill starve pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? and it strikes me it's got to be cause we were something else and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub
i don't want to know
i was there paul dthere in the yard when she did it
what yard? when who
it ain't what you think
you don't know what i think
she ain't crazy she love those children she was trying to outhurt the hurter's all

yeah man
francis donnelly  pleased to meet you
jeffrey lebowski
he's telling the truth up to a point
in a sense yes  elfranco my robe my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal  which bothers some men  the word itself makes some men uncomfortable  vagina
oh yeah?
yes they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say  whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "johnson"
"johnson"?
thank you
yes i know about it  and i know that you acted as courier  and let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven
right but let me explain something about that rug
do you like sex mr lebowski?
excuse me?
sex  the physical act of love coitus  do you like it?
because i don't like your ugly language i heard enough of it in school  now speak czech or english  and don't fool around anymore  you almost got us thrown out
what point?
i was talking about my rug
you're not interested in sex?
you mean coitus?
i like it too  it's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex it can be a natural zesty enterprise but unfortunately there are some peopleit is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in womenwho engage in it compulsively and without joy
oh no
yes mr lebowski these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word  our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these
listen maude i'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho but i don't see what it has to do withdo you have any kalhua?
take a look at this sir
he fixes the cable?
don't be fatuous jeffrey  little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
being back here gives me the willies
little lebowski urban achievers yes and proud we are of all of them i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this "abduction" but i tell you it is preposterous  this compulsive
i'm getting to your rug my  father and i don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and needless to say i don't approve of his still i hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter so i'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to
wellsure i could do that
if you successfully do so i will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum
a hundred
thousand yes bones or clams or whatever you call them
yeah but what about
your rug yes well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me and i am sorry about that crack on the jaw
here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you  you will receive no bill  he's a good man and thorough
that's really thoughtful but i
not the happiest of memories?
please see him jeffrey  he's a good man and thorough
no it's fine really uh
do you have any news regarding my father's money?
i uh money yeah i gotta respecfully 69 you know tender my resignation on that matter 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all
she most certainly was not
hey man why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  you might learn something  now i got
and please don't call her my mother
now i got
she is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim
i'm telling you i got definitive evidence
got it
from who?
the main guy dieter
dieter hauff?
wellyeah i guess
her "costar" in the beaver picture?
beaver?  you mean vagina?i mean you know him?
dieter has been on the fringes of well of everything in la for about twenty years  look at my lp's under 'autobahn'
huh?  autobahn  auto  their music is a sort ofughtechnopop
is he pretending to be the abductor?
wellyeah
have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight
look jeffrey you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with  you can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are
well yeahi know that
so dieter has the money?
well no not exactly  it's a complicated case maude  lotta ins lotta outs  and a lotta strands to keep in my head man  lotta strands in old duder's
do you still have that doctor's number?
huh?  no really i don't even have the bruise any more i
delayed aftereff
i want you to see him immediately
maude?
well uh   not much to tell
i lied wait for it
uhhuh
not the compromised second draft and then i uh   ever hear of the seattle seven?
mmnun
oh?
yeah  roadie for metallica  speed of sound tour
uhhuh
bunch of assholes  and then you know little of this little of that my career's uh slowed down a bit lately
what do you do for fun?
oh you know the usual  bowl drive around  the occasional acid flashback
jackie treehorn trashed the place wanted to save the finder's fee
i don't think that has anything to do with 
finder's fee?
he thought i had your father's money so he got me out of the way while he looked for it
it's not my father's money it's the foundation's  why did he think you had it?  and who does?
larry sellers a highschool kid real fucking brat
it's a complicated case maude lotta ins lotta outs  fortunately i've been adhering to a pretty strict uh drug regimen to keep my mind you know limber  i'm real fucking close to your father's money real fucking close  it's just
i keep telling you it's the foundation's money  father doesn't have any
huh?  he's fucking loaded
no no the wealth was all mother's
but your fatherhe runs stuff he
we did let father run one of the companies briefly but he didn't do very well at it
that means under a year let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me  murder is basic there are no conspiracies no grand mysteries and no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people  it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat dunbar's our guy
but he's
he helps administer the charities now and i give him a reasonable allowance  he has no money of his own  i know how he likes to present himself; father's weakness is vanity hence the slut
huh  jeez  well so did heis that yoga?
well yes what did you think this was all about?  fun and games?
wellno of course not
i want a child
yeah okay but see the dude
look jeffrey i don't want a partner in fact i don't want the father to be someone i have to see socially or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself
huh
exactly  what happened to your face? did jackie treehorn do that as well?
everyone's capable of murder osborne
what?
yeah man it really tied the room together
this was a valued uh
there's no fucking reasonhere's my point dudethere's no fucking reason
huh?  no  what the fuck are you talkingi'm notwe're talking about unchecked aggression here
this chinaman who peed on my rug i can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about?
what the fuck are you talking about? this chinaman is not the issue  i'm talking about drawing a line in the sand dude  across this line you do not uhand also dude chinaman is not the preferred uh   asian american  please
walter this is not a guy who built the rail roads here this is a guy who peed on my
what the fuck are you
