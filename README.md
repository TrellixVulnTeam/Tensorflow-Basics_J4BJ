# Tensorflow-Basics
My practice sessions with Tensorflow in the Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow is awesome and so are you, get on with it. This repository contains the basic implementation of tensorflow. 

I did sentiment analysis using tensorflow, demonstrated the processing of the text file that is required here:  https://git.io/f450x

After this, I have loaded the data and fed it to the neural network, it contains a snapshot of how Tensorboard will look like, code: https://git.io/f45ET

Go through the code if you are interested.
